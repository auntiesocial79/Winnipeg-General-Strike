I stated the other day in the House, and I state now, that private ownership plus politics have brought about the situation with which we are confronted in this country. The Government of Canada in order to save its own investments- represented by its guarantees and the guarantees of the provinces of this Dominion- and to safeguard the transportation interests, has been obliged to take over the railways that we are administering to-day, and will be obliged to take over practically all the other railways except the Canadian Pacific.

Here the Government of Canada has taken over an immense railway system, and we will add to it. But let us take a pride in it, and try to make a success of it.
Mr. ANDREWBOSS MhMASTER (Brome): I will not, I hope, be improperly conducting myself if I propose to bring back the minds and thoughts of the members of this House to the question under discussion, which is not one of public or private ownership, but that of Parliamentary control as distinguished from corporate control. The Acting Prime Minister has so vociferously protested his belief in public ownership that we might think he was a recent convert to the principle, because we have heard of the zeal of the apostate, and perhaps it is possible that the minister is an apostate to the principle of private ownership which he held before.
Now I would submit, in order that we may regard this matter in a calm way, that the question of public or private ownership is not one on which almost religious fervour need be displayed. Is it not rather a question of business? I think it is, and I propose to deal with it on that plane. I am always, Mr. Speaker, most interested in anything the Acting Prime Minister says. I always listen to him with the gravest and most careful attention; and I could not help discerning a strong contrast in what he said to-day as compared to what he said some time ago in connection with the proposal advanced by the hon. member for Shelburne and Queens (Mr. Fielding). That hon. gentleman, the other night when this Bill was under consideration in Committee, made precisely the same suggestion as he made this afternoon. And what was the attitude of the Acting Prime Minister on that occasion? Rising in his seat and turning with all that courteous graciousness with which he is endowed, he said to the hon, gentleman (Mr. Fielding): ""What you say, Sir, is worthy of the deepest consideration. I myself am afraid it is impracticable, but I will consult with the officers of the Government and see whether it would not be in the public interest to meet your views."" To-day the same proposal is laid before the House, -and what does the Acting Prime Minister say? He declares: This is an unfair suggestion, or an unfair speech, or an unfair argument-this is a specious argument. Why the reason for the change? The change from courtesy, the change from the
most kindly consideration to somewhat abrupt negation, is due to the few words dropped by the hon. gentleman (Mr. Fielding). He, alas! said, perhaps not altogether with enthusiasm, that the conduct of these railways was going to be handed over to a group of gentlemen who live in and about Toronto. Is it an aspersion on the Acting Prime Minister that the gentlemen who form the board of management of these railways come from Toronto? I think not. But what caused the heat on the part of my hon. friend (Sir Thomas White)? I will tell the 'House. It is because the Acting Prime Minister saw in the words of the member for Shelburne and Queens what might be construed into a statement that what the Canadian people did not like about this Bill was that they felt afraid that it was the turning back of the Canadian Northern into the hands of the Mackenzie and Mann group. That was what caused the sudden change in the demeanour of the Acting Prime Minister. That hon. gentleman has declared, and I s^y, Amen to his statement, that if we are to have a successful experiment in public ownership, the control of the railways must be placed in the hands of those in whom the Canadian people have confidence. The member for Shelburne and Queens has stated that the public ownership proposal contained in this Bill suffers from two handicaps. I say that it suffers from a third handicap-the handicap that the people of Canada believe the Mackenzie and Mann interests are far too closely in touch with the present proposal.

You could start with the deficits-with the deficit of this year, if you wanted to, or with the average deficits over a period of years-and begin to share profits even before dividends were earned on the investment. There would be nothing wrong about that. You would be getting the hearty co-operation of every man working on the road; every man fnterested in the enterprise would have an opportunity of sharing in its profits, and if the commission was appointed for a term of years would feel that he was free from all political control. It would be in his interest and in the interest of all the men on the road, individually and collectively, to make the road pay as far as possible. The deficit, Mr. Speaker, we must get rid of. We cannot go on multiplying these deficits indefinitely. If we do, we shall kill not only public ownership, but the reputation1 of Canada as well. We must get people into this country. We must get immigration.

If you get the best men possible to manage the railway, and pay them good salaries-pay them anything in reason, because they can save their salaries in a day on this undertaking-and give them a free hand, make the undertaking as free as possible from politics, and get the co-operation not only of the labour organizations and the railway employees but of everybody in the country, the undertaking will be a success instead of showing a deficit. But an audit of the expenditures should be submitted to Parliament, so that the people's representatives can see what is being done with the people's money; because if you do not show that you are honest, if you are unwilling to lay your cards on the table, you cannot expect the people of this country to have confidence in the undertaking. They would not go out of their way to patronize the road or do anything they could to further its interests because they would have the feeling that it was not the interests of the road, their own interests, they were advancing, but the interests of some private individual. Let the Government give us freely and frankly the information they have in their possession, so as to secure the co-operation of everybody.
Some hon. members have suggested that I have been obstructing more or less. Well, at the time to which the hon. member for Red Deer refers, I brought to the attention of the Committee a question which I have since seen repeated in the press, and it is this: The Minister of Railways told us that the'deficit would be about $7,000,000, and that the earnings of the road above operating cost would be about $3,000,000. As I pointed out then, our liabilities in connection with this road amount to something like $470,000,000, the interest on which would be in the neighbourhood of $18,800,000. Deducting $3,000,000, the surplus earnings over operating cost, leaves a deficit of about $15,000,000.' I maintain that it is unreasonable for the Government to accuse the Opposition of obstructing when they refuse to give such information as I am asking for now. The minister made that statement; when I asked him to explain, he did not refute it at all, but simply refused to answer. I might say that when I put the question, we were then under closure, and as soon as any hon. member on. this side of the House asked a question the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Meighen) would say: ""I move that the further consideration of

this question be postponed."" A number of the clauses of this Bill have never been debated in the House, and I think the Government are giving the National Railway Company a very bad start. In the first place, the Bill is being forced through under closure; the vital clauses are not being debated, and the Government will not agree to have an annual report of the undertaking submitted to Parliament.",,,,

I sympathize heartily with the argument that labour ought to be represented on this Board. I hope the Government will keep that in mind and see that labour is represented on the Board, and, if it be possible, labour connected with the railway itself. But there are other classes also that we would like to see represented on the Board, and I do not think it is wise to select one particular class and dictate as to their appointment. For example the hon. member for Quebec South (Mr. Power) suggested- and I like the suggestion-that among the returned soldiers of the engineer corps, there are a number .of very capable men and that it might be desirable that one of this class might be found to go on the board. There is not only the consideration that we would have the benefit of his skill as an engineer, but the fact that he is a returned soldier means a good deal to us all. But I do not think that you should put it in an Act of Parliament that there, must be one. This board ought to represent different interests in the community and if the Government do not see that all legitimate interests are represented, that will be a grievance for which we have a right to call them to account. But I must say that I do not see the logic of saying that as respects one particular section, we will put that in the Bill, but as respects all other elements we will not say anything about them at all. I do not think that is reasonable. I sympathize warmly with the argument that labour ought to be represented on the board, and if the Government fail to provide in some way or other for the representation of labour on that board it will be pursuing a course for which at a later stage it should be called to account in Parliament.

Another matter which I wish to bring to the notice of the minister, so that it can be dealt w-ith before the committee is this: It is stated that those who practically control the fisheries of British Columbia do not pay the ordinary white man in that province a white man's wage, and that in consequence practically every white man in British Columbia has left that business, and to-day the fisheries there are entirely in the.hands of Japanese and Chinamen- in the hands of the Japanese, at all events; I cannot say how far that applies to Chinamen. This situation has been brought about by the fisheries of British Columbia being practically in the hands of a monopoly. If these are the conditions, I am sure the minister would like to see them remedied, and if the purpose of raising the license fee is to give further powers to those who have too much power already, it will be advisable for the committee to consider the matter very carefully, in order that everybody in British Columbia may have the privilege of going into the fishery business if he so desires.

The Opposition was somewhat criticised for seeking for information from the Government in regard to this Bill, although, a number of clauses looked as if they could be amended with advantage to the people of this country and in the interest-of public ownership. When the Bill was in Committee and before closure was brought in, the acting Prime Minister asked that clause 3, pertaining to the capital stock of the company, should stand, the question being whether capital stock should be held by the Minister of Finance without power to dispose of it.

What the hon. member (Mr. Copp) asks us to do is to except the Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island railways from the provisions of the Bill in regard to the operation of the Canadian National railways
Before answering the hon. gentleman's references to the amendment he has moved, let me refer to a few things he has said about the Intercolonial Railway. He states that as agreed on at Confederation the Intercolonial was originally constructed between the Lower Provinces and the City of Quebec, and there is no doubt about that. I also wish to say that so far as I can remember the road was well managed under the former manager, Mr. Pottinger. Mr. Pottinger was a very fine man and had the confidence of all the people in the provinces through which this road runs. But let me say to the hon. gentleman that during the period of Mr. Pottinger's management-during the operation of the road under a commission, and under a general manager, if my memory serves me right-there was always criticism in this House and in the press that political control and political patronage prevailed, and that therefore the railway was not a success. That has been the cry from the very day the Intercolonial Railway was first constructed and operated.

During the present session (the hon. member for Maisonneuve said (unrevised Hansard p. 1815):
Sneaking again on this question of public ownership, it iis a popular fancy at the present; but really those who favour that new fancy should take the time to read some of the best authorities on the question.
He said further, during the present session (Hansard p. 1901):
It is all very well for my hon. friend from South York to say, as he did a moment ago, and as my hon. friend from Bast Algoma said in the fair statement he made this evening, that Ontario and the West want Government ownership. But give to Ontario and the West a few figures as I have done this evening, and you will find that the business sense of the people of those provinces will pause and they will ponder before launching Canada upon such a venture.
The hon. member for Miaisonneuve quoted from the report of a speech by Lord Shaugh-nessy at the Canadian National Exhibition an<l referring to that he said that Lord Shaughnessy is a man "" who knows whereof he speaks,"" and added that "" the words of Lord Shaughnessy were full of wisdom.""

First, I wish to correct a statement made by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White), who represented me this afternoon as being a strong opponent of public ownership of railways. My hon. friend certainly misconstrued my words if he found in them an expression of opposition to the principle of the nationalization of railways. I merely said that nobody had the right to excommunicate from Liberalism those who were opposed to that principle. My speech was made to protest against the lectures on Liberalism which certain hon. gentlemen on the other side are prone to inflict upon us. I said then, and I repeat now, that public ownership, the nationalization of industries, is not a principle of Liberalism; it is state socialism. That does not mean that I am opposed to it. I am not afraid of words. My view is that it is a huge experiment- and I have not the same confidence in its ultimate success as some of my friends in the House seem to have. But we have no choice in the matter. We are the owners of a great system of railways, and we must try to make it the best system possible. We must, as many hon. members have said, give public ownership a fair chance.

I rise, however, for the purpose of giving my hon. friends opposite, who are so eloquent in their professions of Liberalism, an opportunity of registering their votes in favour of what I consider to be a true Liberal principle. When the House was in committee on the Bill I moved that labour be given a fair share in the 'management of the railway, and I purpose now moving an amendment to that effect. The Government, by the voice of the Minister of Labour in the Senate, has already recognized the soundness of that principle, and at the present time a commission is travelling throughout the country investigating industrial conditions in order to apply this principle to private industries. The Government should demonstrate its good faith and sincerity by embodying the same principle in the management of the National railways which are the very property of the state. The workingman who has, by the exercise. of his franchise, a voice in the management of public affairs in this country, believes he has also a right to a voice in the management of the industries which by his work he helps to build up. He claims his industrial citizenship as well as his political citizenship. This desire comes, I believe, from a high sense of service. Most students of labour and industrial conditions in the world to-day are in favour of allowing labour a share in the management of industries. They believe that by raising the employee to a state of partnership with his employer, by acquainting him with the conditions of the undertaking or the business which is common to both, his sense of responsibility will be enhanced and much trouble will be avoided. The British Government has accepted that principle with regard to mines. Let me refer, in this connection, to the commission presided over by Mr. Justice Sankey. The commission was composed of four eminent men-Mr. Justice Sankey, Mr. A. J. Balfour, Sir Arthur Duckham, and Sir Thomas Boyden. Here are a few words from the report of that commission:-
It is in the interests of the country that the colliery worker shall have an effective voice in the direction of the mine. For a generation the colliery worker has been educated socially and technically. The result is a great national asset. Why not use it?
The British Government has accepted that report, and the principle of a share in the management of the British mines has been accepted and will be carried out. This 'Government should embody a similar principle in this legislation which it is endeavouring to induce the industrials of the country to

accept at the present time. By so doing the Government would give effect to the first clause of the resolution adopted by the Peace Conference and proposed to be incorporated in the Peace Treaty. This resolution, which was communicated to the House yesterday by the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Bowell), contained this principle:-
First-the guiding principle above enunciated that labour should not be regarded merely as a commodity or article of commerce.
The best way to recognize that principle is to 'accept the amendment which I now purpose moving. I move, seconded by Mr. Verville:-
That Bill No. 70 be not now read a third time, but be referred back to the Committee of the Whole House, in order that the following words be inserted at the end of clause 1 of the said Bill: "" At least two of said directors shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the employees of the Canadian National railways.""

Lapointe), although it seems almost unnecessary for any hon. member on either side of the House to have to move an amendment of this nature. I was not here all the time when this Bill was under discussion, but I was surprised to hear that a provision of this kind was not inserted by the Government in the Bill. Many hon. members on this side and many who were on this side prior to Union Government have, time and again whenever opportunity offered, declared that labour should, to some extent, be represented on as many commissions as possible, because the practical knowledge of the labour man was probably more effective than the technical knowledge of many men who are appointed on commissions. We have now reached a stage in the development of this country when we must, willingly or otherwise, recognize this principle that labour should be represented, and any Government, whether federal, provincial or municipal, must also recognize it and, put it into operation. Any hon. member who is in business must have long ago concluded that the most valuable information he has ever received in his private business has, generally speaking, come from those who have had the most practical experience. The Minister of Labour has, time and again, and rightly so, consulted the best element of labour in the country in connection with framing legislation or Orders in Council towards a better understanding between capital and labour.

213P
The mover of this amendment stated that the principle of the representation of labour was recognized in the Senate. I claim that it was not recognized in the Senate, because the Minister of Labour should belong to the House of Commons. I know the Minister of Labour very well, and I have great confidence in his ability as well as in his practical knowledge. If any one should be appointed on the Board of Birectors, apart from the great financiers of the country, or men who have experience in the management of a railway, those who have the most knowledge are surely the railwaymen of the land.
Many of them have grown up with the road from boyhood; they have served their apprenticeship and have acquired the most valuable kind of knowledge for a position of this sort. I hope that hon. members will not think that this proposal is put forward for a political purpose. I thought I heard someone laugh on the other side of the House, but I must have been mistaken. Judging by the present conditions in the labour world, I am afraid that if the Government does not grant to the labour organizations what they have a right to expect, they will take the means to get it. This may seem radical, but any one who has studied the feeling of unrest there is throughout the country must realize that there is only one way of salvation, and that is by co-operation to the fullest extent. The Government may not have said that it will not appoint labour men; I do not know whether it has or not, but I am afraid there will be influence enough brought to bear to prevent the appointment of labour men to this directorate. Ever since I have been in this House I have said that a Minister of Labour in this Government would not make a success of his department unless he was a practical man. The Government, fortunately, have seen fit to appoint a practical man to the head of that department. Now what applies to the Department of Labour surely ought to apply to one of the greatest enterprises this country has -ever undertaken. The Government have everything to gain by adopting this amendment. They will find among the railway men some of the ablest men in America, and able not only for their practical knowledge; some members of the Government would no doubt be surprised at the -technical qualifications of some of our railway employees, and perhaps they are more advanced in finance than some of the ministers may think. Those of -them who have acquired a home of their own know exactly what a dollar is worth, and might do better
in financial -matters than others whom the Government may appoint to the board. I do not know of any government, federal or provincial, that has made a mistake through trying to get all classes of -society represented on the commissions it appoints. Furthermore, a practical knowledge of all the great economic questions of the day will perhaps be worth more -than all the technical knowledge put together. I am proud to second the amendment, and I trust the Government will accept it.
Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN (Minister oE the Interior); Among all the remarks made by the mover and the seconder of this amendment I am able to find only one with which I very cordially agree, namely, that we have at the present time in charge of the Department of Labour a gentleman of very great practical ability, of devotion to duty, and of fidelity to the cause of labour. With anything else that has been said I am afraid I must differ. In fact, I must express surprise that so strictly logical a mind as that of the hon. member for Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe) could he brought to support the amendment now before the House. The amendment is to the effect -that the Government in appointing the directorate of this board must accept at least two members chosen by the railway employees. Had the hon. gentleman really meant that the amendment should be considered as a practical step, he would have added to his amendment provisions that would have enabled the Government to ascertain what the recommendation of the railway employees would be. Without, the machinery for its ascertainment, the amendment would be impossible of execution, for there would be no way in which it could be carried out.

COPP (Westmorland):,,'2122 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, before this Bill is finally disposed of, I desire to draw the attention of hon. members to the section providing for the amalgamation of the several railway systems. It provides that the Canadian Northern Railway company and its constituent and subsidiary companies as specified in

the first schedule, together with the Canadian Government railways, shall be operated as a national railway system. My understanding is that, prior to the taking over of the Canadian Northern, the lines of railway known as the Canadian Government railways comprised the Intercolonial railway, running from Montreal to Halifax, Sydney, and St. John, and the branches connected therewith; the Grand Trunk Pacific, and the Transcontinental railway.
I do not propose to take up very much time in discussing this question, but I wish to register my protest against the amalgamation of the Intercolonial railway with the Canadian Northern system. The Intercolonial railway, as every hon. member knows, was built in the early years of Confederation. As a matter of fact, it was one of the terms of Confederation that the Lower Provinces, known as the Maritime Provinces, were to be connected by railway with the other provinces forming the Confederation. That promise was never properly implemented for many years. The railway extended from the cities of Halifax, Sydney and St. John to its western terminus ;at Levis., in the province of Quebec. A short dime after the Hon. A. G. Blair became Minister of Railways in 1896, the Intercolonial was extended to the city of Montreal by the purchase of the Drummond County railway (so called). From that time down to 1908 the road was owned and operated by the Canadian Government as a government enterprise, presided over by the Minister of Railways and Canals, the Hon. H. R. Emmerson occupying that portfolio for some time. While I am not prepared to admit that during that time the road was always run and managed .as it might have been, nevertheless, after its extension to Montreal we' undoubtedly had a better train service, and the roadbed was improved; in fact, the roadbed of the Intercolonial is known to be one of the finest, if not the finest, on the continent of America. The Ocean Limiteds were put on, and the service generally was improved. In the year 1908 or 1909 a change was made in the management of the road. Up to that time a gentleman named David Pottinger had been manager for many years. He had grown up with the railway and had an intimate knowledge of it from one end to the other in all its workings. Associated with him were men who had entered the railway in their younger days, and knew all there was to know about its operation. In 1908 or 1909 Mr. Pottinger was not dismissed, but arrangements were made by which a 
board of managers was appointed to manage the road, of which Mr. Pottinger became one. Since the appointment of that board down to the present day the Intercolonial has been be-dainned and bedevilled by mismanagement and extravagance. Men have been brought in from outside at high salaries and forced upon us who did not know the conditions or understand the operation of this railway. The higher the salaries and the more officials we imported the worse the management became, so that to-day the Intercolonial is not as well operated as it ~was in 1907 and 1908 and the years previous thereto. Furthermore, since the Government have taken over the Canadian Northern, the Transcontinental, and the Grand Trunk Pacific, the Intercolonial has been robbed of its rolling stock, and we have not been given the train service that we had every reason to expect.
I register my protest against the Intercolonial being hooked up to the Canadian Northern Railway system .and the supplanting of the Intercolonial railway employees who have spent half a lifetime on this road, know the operations and are just as capable of occupying prominent railway positions in this- country and fulfilling the duties appertaining to them as any person brought in from the outside. The employees of the old Intercolonial railway throughout the Maritime Provinces are being supplanted by other employees who are not any more capable, but are, if anything, less capable, than the men who have occupied prominent positions on that road. I have no word to say against those who will manage the Canadian National Railway system or the Canadian Northern railway. I do not know what their success may be. I trust it will be of the very best.
I have nothing to say against the Government for passing this measure and operating the Canadian Northern railway, as it has been forced upon them. But I do protest against, the amalgamation of the Intercolonial railway with that system. It never was the intention at the time of Confederation that we should be linked up with that system. It never -was the intention at the time of Confederation that we should be linked up with, and operated as, a company road. I protest as strongly as I can because of the fact, which the hon. member for Antigonish and Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair) referred to a few moments ago, that under this measure the Government, or the company, have the power of bonding, or mortgaging, the Canadian National

railway to the extent of $75,000 per mile.
I am firmly of the belief that in carrying out the terms of Confederation we should own the Government railway. It should be operated by the Government through the department, and Minister of Railways and Canals. That was the intention of the Confederation pact and it should be carried out to the letter. '
The Intercolonial railway is not in as good a position as it was years ago. The road-bed has been allowed to deteriorate, the cars are not kept in .the same condition, our train service is not as prompt and regular as it was, and the more outside management there has been brought in the worse it has been for the Intercolonial railway. I do not know what other members, particularly from the Maritime Provinces can think of this matter, and it is possible that some may say that it is local. While it may be somewhat local, on the other hand, I claim that it is Dominion-wide. You cannot successfully build up the Dominion of Canada by tearing down one part and handing it over to some other part.	The Intercolonial has always had its head offices at Moncton. We have magnificent shops and buildings to house and take care of the Intercolonial staff. We have upwards of 2,000 miles of railway including the Intercolonial proper and the branches that have been purchased, leased and otherwise acquired, and that is a sufficient system for a manager and his official staff to take care of. I have nothing to say against other systems of railways. What I ask is that the Government and the Minister of Railways should realize that the people of the Maritime Provinces have regarded the Intercolonial railway as one of the Teasons of their coming into Confederation. The other provinces have had a quid pro quo for all we have had from the -Intercolonial. They have their canals. There is no move being made to hand the canals over to any company. The Intercolonial was never intended to he a paying proposition. All that was expected was that it would pay its running expenses. I strongly believe that if the road were freed from political agitation and if the Minister of Railways would take hold of it and put practical, straightforward men who have had some experience on that railway, we would have a system by itself equal to any other system and which would be a great benefit to this country, particularly to the people of the Maritime Provinces. I would ask the minister to consider well the question of the conditions under which we are to have our produce shipped from the Maritime Provinces and whether this road should be operated as a Government proposition. I move, seconded by Mr. -Sinclair (Antigonish and Guysborough):
That Bill No. 70 be not now read a third time but that It be referred back to the Committee of the Whole to -be amended by adding, after the word "" railways "" in the tenth line of the preamble thereof, the following words:
"" save and except that portion of the Canadian Government Bail-ways known as the Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island Bailway and the branch lin-es connected therewith, owned, leased or operated by the Government of Canada.""
I make that motion seconded by my hon. friend from Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair).

come from a part of the province of Ontario, Mr. Speaker, where a great majority of the people believe in the principle of public ownership, and believing as I do also in the principle, I am particularly concerned that at this time we should in discussing this measure come to a proper conclusion regarding it.
It is of the greatest possible importance that public ownership should be started on a proper basis. I have been a member of this House for some years, and I confess that from the first time that I came into the House, as I listened to the discussion of the Estimates of the Intercolonial Railway, my thought was that never could the Intercolonial Railway be carried along successfully by the method then followed. It seems to me that the first thing Parliament has to learn in connection with the public ownership of railways is that Parliament knows nothing at all about railway operation; that the running of railways should be delegated to some other body. If we were to go to the Board of Directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and say that they should submit their budget for each financial year to a body such as this, they would say that the idea was the height of the ridiculous. They would say that they could not hope to make a success of the Canadian Pacific railway by the
adoption of such methods as have been employed by the Dominion in past years.
The amendment introduced this afternoon suggests that in the Bill which has been brought down, Parliament is taking a most radical step; that Parliament is making a departure from anything before attempted in this country, and that it is a move in the wrong direction. With that contention I most emphatically disagree. I believe that the only way in which this great undertaking can be successfully carried on is by the method adopted under this Bill. The principle may be a new one to this Parliament. We have had a very clear description of what has governed in these matters in the Motherland. However, the principle adopted by this Bill has been carried out in connection with provincial and municipal finances. While in the past it has been the governing principle that all revenue received by a municipal council shall be under the control of and shall be spent by that municipal council, nevertheless, in Ontario and throughout the Canadian West, where we -have had considerable experience with public ownership, it has been found that public undertakings cannot be carried along on the old-fashioned lines. The municipal councils of Ontario and the West have adopted the very principle embodied in this Bill. They have appointed commissions in connection with their waterworks plants, their electric plants, and so on; and these public works are being administered just as it is proposed to administer this great public railway system.
If the member for Shelburne and Queens (Mr. Fielding) had stood up in the Legislature of Ontario fifteen or eighteen years ago and made the speech that he made in this House this afternoon, no doubt he would have received applause from both sides of the House. But conditions have changed in this country. The Ontario Legislature found that they could not carry along that great public undertaking, the hydro-electric movement, by the old methods. What did they do? They did just what -the Government propose to do in this case; they placed the thing under the control of a commission. What does that commission do? Does it come to the Legislature? Do members on both sides of the legislature discuss, pro and con, all the different works and activities proposed to be -entered upon by the HydroElectric Commission? No; this commission goes on with its work of administration, just as the directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company do in connection with



their own undertaking. Each year t<he commission prepares a report and submits it to the legislature, and the legislature may see whether the operations of the commission show a deficit or a surplus. The matter is open to the fullest investigation on the part of the legislature; any kind of audit that is deemed necessary may be made. I submit that if public ownership is to be a success in Canada, it will only be by the adoption of such methods as have been found necessary in municipalities all through the country, and as have been found necessary in Ontario in connection with that most successful public undertaking which Ontario is carrying on.
1 said a moment ago that in connection with public ownership Parliament had some things to learn. I believe that the only way in which we can make a success of this undertaking is by getting the right class of men. The essence of the whole thing is the selection of an efficient board of directors, and the building up of a proper executive. In this connection one thing has always occurred to me as I have followed the deliberations of this House. Perhaps I should not criticise; yet I feel that if we are to obtain the class of men necessary to make public ownership a success, this House of Commons has to learn to use such men decently, not to treat them as if they were pickpockets. What I have in mind is this: if Parliament, for instance, were to get men who have brought distinction to themselves and have made such a success of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company-men like Sir William Van Horne or Lord Shaughnessy-to take charge of the Government railways, and if these men were criticised and abused, as I have heard public servants criticised and abused in this House, you could not hope to induce men of that calibre to continue in the public service. We are all concerned about the success of this great undertaking. We may have differences of opinion as to how its operation can be made successful; as to the best way of administering it. But as Canadians we are all interested in its success, and I believe most sincerely that we can -make it a success only by carrying it on according to sound business principles and by treating fairly and well the men in public employ.
There has been a good deal of criticism in this House-to-day as well as the last day that this matter came up in Committee -of the application of closure. It was not my privilege to be in the House during the first three days that the Bill was discussed
[Mr. Seolt.l
in Committee. I had opportunity of studying it and hearing it explained only on one day in the committee stage, when it was considered under the closure rule. But I had not sat in the House very many hours before I had made up my mind with regard to the Bill. As to the talk about closure, it seems to me that the business of the country would be greatly facilitated and carried out in much better form if we had a little more of the application qf closure.
I have seen the same thing happen on several occasions. Some of the best speeches that I have ever heard in this House were twenty minute speeches under the closure rule, and with this Bill in the Committee stage for four days, with its introduction some time before that, and with the opportunity of discussing it on this occasion, this Parliament has surely had ample time to digest and consider everything in connection with it.
Reference has been made to the Canadian Pacific, and it does not seem to be the opinion of this Parliament that this is the proper time to acquire the Canadian Pacific. The financial considerations are indeed, great, but I am convinced that this country cannot go on with one-half of its railways publicly owned and the other half privately owned. In the years to come there is bound to be conflict between the two, and consciously or unconsciously, Parliament, in the end, is not going to give a square deal to the privately owned company. Therefore, if the Canadian Pacific Railway Company were wise in their day and generation, they would say that the present is the proper time to get together with the Dominion Government and make these two great systems into one large State-owned system. That may not come at the present time, but I am satisfied it will come some time, and it will he one of the best"" things that could happen to the Dominion of Canada. The railway business
is,	like every other business, a good one. In any line of business, you wilL see some persons succeeding while others are doing the reverse, and the success of this undertaking will depend entirely, as I said before, on the class of men secured to handle
it.	If the Canadian Pacific could he taken over by the Dominion of Canada and combined with the roads acquired or about to be acquired by the Government, we would have, not only control of the railroads of Canada, but the finest organization of railroad administrators in the entire world, because, is there any reason why these men who have so successfully administered

the Canadian Pacific-and we as Canadians are all proud of the way in which they have administered it-could not take over all the railroads of Canada in the public interest and administer them for the public good?
Mr. D. D. 'McKENZIE (Cape Breton North): Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Government ('Sir Thomas White) for a while played fair with this Bill and followed it up in its real purpose. At a certain stage, however, of the proceedings in connection with it he commenced to play politics and to draw a distinction- between the two sides of the House by saying that we were opposed to Government ownership of railways and that he was in favour of it, hoping thereby to get some applause from bis followers and some kudos in some parts of the country where, for the present, Government ownership happens to be popular. Every hon. member who expects to enjoy public confidence should endeavour to serve the public honestly and squarely whin his opinions and not trim his sails to every wind that blows over the country.' No man can expect to enjoy the full confidence oi the people-and whether he enjoys their confidence or not, to do what is best for the people-unless- he has sound principles of his own, and is not capable of being carried away for the moment by a current of public opinion. I venture to tell the Acting Prime Minister that his history is not that of a man who favours public ownership. His history, within a few years, aye, within a few weeks, was that he was a strong supporter and advocate of private ownership. But in playing politics a few days ago he found it advisable to trim his sails to suit the breeze and he became favourable to public ownership.
That question is not before the House at all; it is not under discussion, and it was not discussed -at any stage, whether public ownership was popular or not, or whether it was a proper policy or not. We have public ownership of railways, and the purport of this Bill is how best to handle the property which we have as public owners. I challenge the Acting Prime Minister to say that if the -Canadian Northern 'Company was making a success of its business as the Canadian Pacific is he would step in and take it from them and handle it as a publicly owned enterprise. He would do nothing of the kind, and he is simply making a virtue of a necessity. We were forced into taking over the Canadian Northern and because of that we have to make the best of it. The Acting Prime Minister would, I am
135i
sure, be the last man, whether intentionally or not, to misquote any hon. member, and I wish to be generous to him and say that, inadvertently, he misquoted me to-day. He quoted me as saying, in connection with this Bill, that I was opposed to public ownership, whereas, he was reading from a statement I made over a year ago, on the first occasion that the Minister of Railways brought in his Estimates, and his report on the Government ownership of a railway which we then had, which we had been running for nearly a year, and for which he was looking for more money. In connection with the business that was before the House then, over a year ago, I made the statement which the Acting Prime Minister quoted as if I had made it the other day.

The object of the Bill is to make the annual fee for such license $500, and in addition, four cents for each case of 48 one-pound cans, or the equivalent thereto, of sockeye salmon, and three cents for each case of 48 one-pound cans, or the equivalent thereto, of any other species of salmon, including Steel Head packed in such cannery during the continuance in force of the license. The said $500 shall be paid before the license is issued, and the remainder of the license fee shall be paid as the minister may from time to time by regulation prescribe.
Heretofore, the fee charged to canners in British Columbia was $50 a year, and it was felt by my department that that was altogether too low a fee in view of the privileges they receive. Therefore, the object of this Bill is to raise the fee from



$50 to $500 per annum, with the additional charge of the amounts that I have just cited on the catch of fish. This matter was ' taken up fully with the canners who, along with the members of Parliament from British Columbia, agreed to it unanimously.

The hon. member for Shelburne and Queen's (Mr. Fielding) has stated that a month was taken up by the debate on the Address. Now, so far as the Government is [DOT] concerned, we do not regard that as a waste of time. For the last four years, the business of administration has had the right of way in this Parliament, and the members from the different sections of the country have had comparatively little to say; not because they did not have much to say with regard to the needs of their various sections, but owing to the demands of the war and the exigencies of 'the situation, Government business naturally had practically a monop. oly of the time of the House. That was true of the British Parliament as well. But when the war was over, it was highly desirable that hon. members should to the extent they desired have opportunity to express their views and those of the people of the different sections from which they come with regard to the public questions of the day. And one of the most useful debates we have in this House, one of the most useful in its effects upon public opinion in this country, was the debate upon the Address, which lasted some three or four weeks. There is a function of Parliament apart from the function of despatching legislation before it, and that is the function of expressing what the people throughout the country are thinking about. If you have debates in Parliament and free expression of opinion here, you are not likely to have turbulent expression of opinion outside, because the people read what their representatives are saying in Parliament and are content with the expression of their views there. Many evils in the state are avoided by free discussion by members in the House of Commons of the questions in which their various sections of the country are interested.
Before leaving the question of closure, let me say that my hon. friend the leader of the Opposition showed-I shall not say an eleventh-hour repentance, but a two-o'clock-in-the-morning repentance on the
question of public ownership. At two minutes after two in the morning he said: After all, we on this side are not opposed to public ownership. That is one of the good results that followed from the application of the closure. My hon. friend (Mr. Fielding) has said that public ownership starts handicapped by the fact that closure was applied. Now it is very important that public ownership should start with the sanction of the leader of the Opposition, and one of the good effects of closure was that at two minutes after two in the morning the hon. leader of the Opposition informed the House that after all said and done the Opposition had not been opposing the principle of public ownership. So the application of closure was not altogether an evil as suggested by the hon. member, because when closure was applied the leader of the Opposition and most hon. members opposite were most anxious to impress the House and the country that in reality, notwithstanding what they had said, they were really public ownership men.
And as to statements which had been made previously by hon. gentlemen opposite on the question of public ownership when it was not an issue, in order that there may be no doubt where hon. gentlemen opposite stood on this question, I am going to read a few extracts from Hansard. I find that my hon. friend the leader of the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie) said in 1916 (Hansard, p. 3989):
As to the nationalization of railways I am opposed to it. I believe that we should encourage individual energy, enterprise and initiative instead Of putting everything into a common pool, which tends to kill individual enterprise. We should take a leaf out of the book of the United States where there has been little nationalization.
That was his attitude in 1916. In 1917 he said (Hansard, p. 4039-40):
I have been watching this proposition since he (iSir Thomas) introduced legislation last year for the purpose of appointing the Commission whose report we heard read in part to-day. When that resolution was proposed I said to the minister that if he wanted my opinion it was against the public ownership of railways. I did not expect my opinion to have any (weight with the minister at that time. But, I am still of the same opinion that the public ownership of railways, generally speaking, is not a good thing for this country. 1 say that more particularly with respect to the developing of a country such os the Northwest is. If the people of the West will trust themselves as far as spreading out of the (branches of any Government owned railway is concerned to Government ownership, they will find it will be a failure.

And he concluded:
I am opposed to Government ownership under these conditions.
I submit that that gives a clu? to the attitude of hon. gentlemen opposite on section 20 oi the Bill, which was so much discussed in this House. That section provided for the revival of charters owned by the Canadian Northern Railway system, many ot which authorized tire construction of railways m the West, and my hon. friend the leader of the Opposition said in 1917:
If the people of the West will trust themselves as far as spreading out of the branches of any Government owned railway is concerned to Government ownership, they will find it will be a failure.
Again in 1917 he said (Hansard p. 4529):
I am not in favour of public ownership. I am against it. But if we are down to the position when we have to take over the ownership of this road, let us take it clean out, let us take everything in connection with it that will he of (benefit and service to the people.
Later in the same year he interjected into the speech of the hon. member for South York ('Mr. Maclean) this remark (Hansard p. 4533):
Sir John Macdonald was opposed to public ownership.
To which the hon. member for South York replied:
No, he was not.
In 1917 the leader of the Opposition also said (Hansard p. 5035):
While the Government ownership of railways may be all' right in itself, I am not at all in
favour of it	We have the example
of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It is not a Government owned railway.
And he argued that if default was made we should take everything embodied in the agreement of 1914. In 1918 my hon. friend (Mr. McKenzie) endorsed the policy of Sir Wilfrid Laurier so far as railway building was concerned. He added (Hansard p. 1379):
There was a good deal of criticism then (1911) by newspapers supporting the Government of the railways the Government had on their hands at that time.
He went on to say that in my first Budget I had made no complaint of the financial situation, and had said, while making some criticism of the Grand Trunk Pacific, that it ""was a valuable asset to the Canadian people."" Coming down to the last debate, my hon. friend said:
I was never in favour of Government ownership. I am not in favour of it now, as I think private enterprise will do better in these

matters. Particularly in colonization and development will private enterprise do much better than Government ownership.
I am not putting this forward by way of criticism of the hon. leader of the Opposition. He is perfectly entitled to hold the views he does, but what is essential is that it should be known where he and those whom he leads stand on this question, and I submit that the extracts I have read indicate clearly the profound distrust of the leader of the Opposition of the principle of public ownership of railways.

Hon. W. 8. FIELDING (Shelburne and Queen's): I had hoped that before we reached this the final stage of the Bill the Government would have seen their way clear to make such an amendment as would 'bring it into conformity with what to my mind are the very first principles of our parliamentary system of government. I regret that they have not been able to do so. I think their departure from what I regard as the sound principles of parliamentary finance is too grave a matter to be passed over lightly. I think we should have a further consideration of the subject; at all events, that we should have a deliberate and recorded vote of the House upon it.
This Bill proposes to apply to one of the largest portions of the public business certain rules and principles which are at variance, I think, with the established principles of our parliamentary system, and entirely at variance with the rules and principles which are applied to all- other branches of our public service. A cardinal principle of our parliamentary system is that Parliament, and especially the House of Commons, shall retain full and unrestricted control over the appropriation of public money. That is a principle which applies under all British legislative systems; it is a principle which applies in Canada to-day; it is a principle which will apply after this Bill shall pass, if it is to pass, to all the other departments of public business in Canada. But for some strange reason, it is not to apply to the operation of this railway company.

I shall regret if the motion which I am about to make will be regarded by my hon. friends on the treasury benches as one of non-confidence. I do not think it should be so regarded, for neither in the motion itself nor in anything that I may say in connection with it will there be any justification for such an attitude. I think the question is one on which we may reasonably ask to have a free and open vote. If the motion which I shall make and the reasons accompanying it commend themselves to the judgment of hon. members of the House, I think they should feel free to vote on the merits of the question, and that the Government should be willing to accept the conclusion that they may reach.
It was suggested at an early stage of the discussion of this subject that some exceptional method was necessary in dealing with the finances of this railway company in order to avoid the evils, real or imaginary, in connection with political patronage. Now I do not think any argument can be founded on that. While, under this Bill, we shall transfer a large portion of the public business of the country to one group of gentlemen, separate and apart from the usual principles of parliamentary government, we are not going to turn everything over to them. A very considerable portion of the public business of this country will still be subject to the rules and principles to which I have referred. Each of the ministers of the Crowm will still have to do some public business, and some of them much public business, and if the principle of patronage will not enter into the public business in their hands under the old order of things, why must it necessarily enter into the management of the railways if the old rules remain? Therefore, if it be contended for one moment that this departure from what I believe to be the sound principle must be taken in order to avoid the evil of political patronage, my answer is that we shall still have a large volume of public business to be conducted under the old principles; and if that business can be conducted in the old way without bringing in any question of party patronage, why cannot the business of this railway company be conducted in the same manner? So I feel that no well-founded argument can be made along that line.
When this Bill first came before the Committee it was in the form of a resolution in which, as hon. gentlemen will remember, all the clauses of the Bill had been thrown
together into one single sentence, so that there was difficulty in understanding it. In consequence of that the minister in charge of the Bill expressed a desire that the discussion should not be protracted at that stage but that the matter might be more properly considered when the Bill had been brought before the Committee of the House. The point I am now making was first raised by the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) who called attention to the exceptional circumstances under which the finances of this Kailway Board were to be handled. The hon. Minister of Railways and Canals then said:
But this is a matter for the consideration of the Committee, and if there is .any objection to the plan proposed, or if the Committee thinks the other way is better, we can change it.
So, at that time, it did not seem that the Government were finally committed to the principle to which I am now taking exception. The minister rather intimated that it was a fair matter for consideration and could be dealt with later on. When the Bill did come before .the Committee of the Whole House, the question was again raised and strong reasons, I think, were urged why this Bill should be brought into conformity with the general practice. However, the Government have not seen their way to do so and we are obliged now to consider the Bill in its present form.
On the principle of public ownership, I do not think it is necessary to say much. I think we have now advanced too far to make that an open question for debate. We have, whether we like it or not, a considerable measure of public ownership. It is unavoidable and I have no desire to quarrel with it at all. I accept it as it is. We have to accept it whether we like it or not. I am not as enthusiastic as some hon. gentlemen are in praise of the principle as applied to our railways. On the contrary^ I frankly admit that this is a great experiment and I have grave doubts as to its ultimate success. But nevertheless I have no desire to oppose or to obstruct it. On the contrary, if we are to have the principle of public ownership, I should like to see the thing get a fair chance. But, it is not going to get a fair chance under this Bill.
The principle of public ownership, in so far as it is represented in this Bill, commenced with two handicaps. The first was the handicap of the closure. I cannot help thinking that it was unwise on the part of the Government to attempt to force this measure through the House by this exeep-",,,,
proceedings1919_05_06.csv,529103,ca.proc.d.1919-05-06.9.1.2,1919-05-06,,,,stagedirection,,,,"tional method of procedure. I know there are circumstances under which closure may be justified, but they are very rare in our parliamentary history. The very fact that we have in our rules a system of closure tends to prevent obstruction, and it is a rare occasion when the Government is justified in using the machinery that it provides. It is a good thing to have the strength of a lion; it is not a good thing to use that strength frequently. I do not think that the circumstances justified the application of closure to this Bill. This Bill had been before the House in the form of a resolution for a very brief discussion, and when it took the shape of a Bill and came before the Committee of the Whole, it was taken up on a Wednesday; it was debated on Wednesday and Thursday, and on Friday the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Meighen) gave notice of closure, which took effect at the next sitting of the House. It was a short time to allow for the discussion of one of the most important Bills of the session. We have not been in a hurry about other legislation. We spent a month, less two days, in the discussion of the Address, a matter of importance, I grant you, but after all, a matter of form. There are Bills on the Order Paper that have been there for five or six weeks. There is no rush about them. We have been leisurely discussing the Immigration Act, a very serious matter, I acknowledge, but we are still slowly getting along with it. We have been, in an equally leisurely manner, discussing the Bankruptcy Act and there is no rush about it. Why then at a time when, although we seem to be busily occupied, when it is common rumour in many quarters not unfriendly to the Government, that the business is not being hurried but that the Government are really marking time and waiting for the Prime Minister to come home, should it have been necessary to apply *closure in the case of this Bill? I do not think any good reason was given. That is .the first handicap.
The second handicap is the effort to associate with public ownership the disregard of all the safeguards which have been established by the wisdom of parliamentarians in the years gone by. We are asked to associate with public ownership this disregard of a principle, which is not calculated to commend the system to the minds of thoughtful men. I have said that this Bill proposes to disregard the essential principle of the parliamentary control of public finance. There is no question but that the control of the public purse is the first and greatest duty of the House of Com-[Mr. Fielding. 1
mons, and when 'we depart from that we are certainly taking a very grave step. When we are doing it in this case, and conveying to the public the idea that we must disregard all those safeguards in order to apply public ownership, we are not giving public ownership a fair chance. Instead of advancing public ownership by those methods, I am inclined to think that the members of the Government are rather giving the principle of public ownership a black eye.
This principle of parliamentary control of public moneys is, as I have said, a very vital principle in our system of government. It ought not to be necessary to argue that question at all. But, Sir, since hon. gentlemen have introduced this Bill and since they have, as I say, disregarded all those principles, I think I would be justified in calling the attention of the House to one or two authorities in point, a thing which ought not to be necessary, but the presence of this Bill makes it so. Sir Erskine May, page 56, says:-
The most important power vested in any branch of the legislature is the right of voting money for the exigencies of the public service. The exercise of this right by the Commons is practically a law for the annual meeting of Parliament for redress of grievances; and it may also he said to give to the Commons the . chief authority in the state. In all countries the public purse is one of the main instruments of political power; but with the complicated relations of finance and public credit in England, the power of giving or withholding the supplies at pleasure is one of absolute supremacy.
That power of the House of Commons of absolute supremacy over public money is to be disregarded and\ set aside by the Bill which is now before us. Section 16 to which I take exception reads:-
Notwithstanding anything in the Government Railways Act or the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, all expenses incurred in connection with the operation or management of the Canadian Government Railways, under the provisions of this Act, shall be paid out of the receipts and revenues of the Canadian Government Railways. In the event of a deficit occurring at any time during any fiscal year the amount of such deficit shall from time to time be payable by the Minister of Finance out of any unappropriated moneys in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada, the amounts paid by the said minister under this section to be included in the Estimates submitted to Parliament at its first session following the close of such fiscal year; and in the event of a surplus existing at the close of any fiscal year such surplus shall be paid into the said fund.
Now. Sir, that presents this situation to us: That while as respects every other branch of the public service of Canada the

revenue must' be paid into the public treasury, and be subject to the vote of this House for its payment out of the Treasury, we are to give to a body of gentlemen in Toronto-estimable and honourable gentlemen; I do not for a moment suggest anything to the contrary-we are going to place in their hands the enormous power of handling I do not know how many millions of the public funds of this country without asking for any parliamentary appropriation. I am amazed that the Government could bring forward such a measure. The members of the Government, in their several departments, have large responsibilities. My hon. friend the Minister of Customs collects a large amount of money. He is not allowed to have at his own disposal one dollar of that money; it must go into the public treasury, and once there it cannot be got out again unless this House has made an appropriation which will cover the proposed expenditure. My hon. friend the Minister of Public Works has large enterprises; he has to be subject, and will continue to be subject, to this rule of parliamentary appropriation. My hon. friend the Minister of Finance is the custodian of large sums of money which come into his hands officially from the various sources of our Tevenue, and these sums are larger than usual now because we are floating large loans. At one time during the present year, the hon. gentleman was the custodian of an amount which represented six hundred and more millions of dollars. Not one penny of these moneys is placed at the disposal of the Minister of Finance; these moneys are paid into the Dominion Treasury, into the consolidated revenue account, and once paid in, the Minister of Finance cannot draw out enough to pay even for cab hire until there has been an appropriation' for it by this House. Now if that has to be dope in the case of the Minister of Finance, and in the case of the other ministers of the Crown, why in the world do we make an exception in this case, and say that these gentlemen in Toronto who are managing these railroads are to have an entirely different rule applied to them?
While, as I say. the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, or any minister of the Crown, could not pay for the hire of a cab on public account unless he had an appropriation for the purpose, we are proposing to give to this body of gentlemen in Toronto an unrestricted right to handle enormous sums of money. The revenues of these railways will be very large, indeed. We appropriated last year for the expenditure on the
Intercolonial, or the Government Eailways, $37,000,000. With the enlargements proposed by the present Bill I shall not be surprised-I am only making a guess-if the revenues which are to be received by these gentlemen at Toronto amount to seventy, eighty, perhaps one hundred millions of dollars; and if the larger scheme of public ownership which is often suggested in this House be included-as is also provided for in the Bill,-then the revenues which will be placed in the hands of these gentlemen at Toronto may run into enormous figures-I do not think it would be too much to say $150,000,000 a year. Why in the world these gentlemen should be allowed these privileges, why we should remove all checks and guards with regard to parliamentary appropriations in the case of these and not in the case of the other departments, of the Government, I am quite unable to understand. These gentlemen are to collect these vast revenues, they are to use them, presumably for railway purposes, at their own sweet will. They do not have to come here and ask for any appropriation; and if at the end of the year this thirty, forty, fifty, sixty or one hundred millions of dollars of money, whatever it may be, proves insufficient, they can walk over to the office of the Minister of Finance and say: ""Hand us out the balance."" And without any further ado, or any further appropriation of money by Parliament, the Minister of Finance is bound to comply with their request. Surely, Mr. Speaker, tl^at is a departure from all the sound principles of finance. Later on, after they have done that-after they have collected this money and have spent it without authority other than the general power conferred by this Bill-after they have collected these moneys and have spent them, and any additional sum that they get from the Finance Minister, then they are to come down and tell us what they have done; after it is all over they will come to us, we will take their statement and an estimate will be submitted to this House. I do not think, Sir, that is a sufficient recognition of the principle of parliamentary government to which I have referred.
I have given you the opinion of Sir Erskine May, a recognized English writer on the subject. Let me now quote from one of our Canadian writers who is generally regarded as an authority. Sir John Bourinot at page 404 of his work says:",,,,
proceedings1919_05_06.csv,529104,ca.proc.d.1919-05-06.9.1.3,1919-05-06,,,,stagedirection,,,,"The rules of the House with respect to the expenditure of public money and the imposition of burthens upon the people are in conformity with the .practice of its English prototype. All the checks and guards which the wisdom of English parliamentarians has imposed in the course of centuries upon public expenditure now exist in their full force in the Parliament of the Dominion. The cardinal principle which underlies all parliamentary rules and constitutional provisions with respect to money grants and public taxes is this- when burthens are to be imposed on the people every opportunity must be given for free and frequent discussion, so that Parliament may not by sudden and hasty votes incur any expenses, or be induced to approve of measures which entail heavy and lasting burthens on the country.
In the citations which I have given we have the authority of Sir Erskine May, and we have the authority of Sir John Bourinot which we also respect in this House; so I do not think there is any room to debate the fact that I have stated the principle correctly. If I were to say that there is absolutely no precedent for what hon. gentlemen are doing, I might not be exactly correct; I think they might have a precedent. Probably they would find it by going back some seventy years, or thereabouts, and they would then discover, Sir, that the precedent in question was one under which a system had grown up such as they now approve; but that system was condemned by the British House of Commons, and ever since the- year 1854 there has been no return to it. Sir Erskine May, at page 546, says:
Until 1854 estimates were not presented in respect of the revenue departments. Prior to that year the charges of collecting the revenue were deducted by each department from the gross sum collected.
That is exactly what is proposed to be done in this case,
This practice, which withdrew the full produce of the taxes and the cost of collection from the immediate control of Parliament, was condemned by a resolution of the House 30th May, 1848 ; and pursuant to an Act passed in the year 1854 the whole of the net revenue derived from taxation is paid into the exchequer, and the oost of the revenue departments is included in the annual estimates.
Taxation does not differ, so far as revenue is concerned, from the earning power of our public works. The money received from sale of a postage stamp is as much part of the revenue of the Government as a bill of duties collected by the Minister of Customs.
I have said, Sir, that I would like to see public ownership get a chance, and that it is not getting a fair chance by this Bill. There has been some experience in public

ownership elsewhere: Public ownership is in operation in Australia and in New Zealand. I have under my hand the New Zealand Year Book. From it I learn that the receipts of the Railway Department of New Zealand are paid into the consolidated revenue fund, and the appropriations for that department are made in the same way as in the case of any other department. That is the system which we have in Canada to-day, and that is the system which I would like continued as respects these railways with which we are now dealing. Then public ownership exists in Australia also. I have here the Australian Railway Acts, or some of them, and I find that there it is distinctly provided that the receipts from passenger fares and traffic on the Australian railways must be paid into the treasury. They will be found in the consolidated revenue fund-the receipts on one side and the expenditures on the other. Indeed, in Australia the position is still stronger, for so firmly is this principle held -this principle which my hon. friends of the Government have too lightly esteemed -that it forms a part of the Australian Constitutional Act. In that Act it is distinctly declared that all receipts and revenues of the Commonwealth must be paid into the public treasury-the consolidated fund. So by the experience of other countries where public ownership obtains, and by our own experience in relation to our public affairs generally, it seems to me that we ought to have no difficulty in reaching a conclusion that it is not necessary to give to this board of directors in respect of the management of these railways any powers that we do not give to our own departments of the Government.
I think, Sir, that if the Government sincerely wish to give public ownership a fair trial they will not handicap it bjr disregarding the rules, the laws, and the customs which have been handed down to us by the wisdom of parliaments in the Mother Country and in all the colonies to which we can look for example. It seems to me, therefore, that it is in every way desirable that the Government should not press this Bill in its present form, and to give them an opportunity to reconsider it, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Brome (Mr. McMas-ter):-
That all the words after the word "" he "" to the end of the question be left out and that the following words:-
""-re-committed to a committee of the Whole House with power to amend the Bill by striking out section 16 and inserting the following section:

16. The receipts and expenditures of the company shall be subject to the provisions of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act.""

In the first place I do not believe that the people of Canada want to divide the control of the Canadian National railways with any person. We have this railway system now; we have an opportunity of testing out public ownership of railways, .and until the people of Canada decide that they cannot manage this system, the stock of the Canadian National railway company should be vested absolutely in the hands of the Government, and no part of it should be disposed of until the matter is brought before this Parliament. The acting Prime Minister the other day, in making a speech in which he intimated that there was obstruction, stated, in reply to a question, that the press of Canada was with him. He said:
We practically have all the press now. The press of the country is above all things an intelligent press, and It is inconceivable that it should not strongly support this Union Government.
I do not know whether he meant in its every action or not, but presumably he meant in connection with the railways. I have here a clipping from the Toronto Globe and also one from the Montreal Star, two reasonably respectable journals of this country, two journals that are supporting Union Government in most of its legislation, but they are not altogether convinced that the action of the Government in connection with the National railway is the best for the country. The Toronto Globe, of April 30, says in an editorial:
The people are restive and apprehensive when they learn that Mr. Z. A. Lash, K.C., was engaged by the Government of Canada to draft legislation for the 'National railways, and that although the original Mackenzie and Mann are no longer doing contracting work for the Canadian Northern railway, there are still gentlemen of the same name operating as the North ern Construction company. There would be more confidence in the Intention of the Government to make a real fight for the creation of an efficient National Kailway System were one or two outstanding advocates of public ownership given seats on the National Board and a conspicuously efficient member of the Grand Trunk operating staff chosen as principal assistant to Mr. Hanna. There is no reason why the officials of the defunct Canadian Northern should crowd ail others off the public ownership bench. If they continue to do so, there will inevitably he bred in the public mind the suspicion that public ownership is merely camouflage for the same old crowd of promoters and contractors operating in the same old way.

The Toronto Globe is, by the way, an ardent advocate of public ownership. The Montreal Star, which is, I believe, opposed to public ownership and in favour of private ownership, says under date of April 28:
Why the rush? Sir Thomas White, the Acting Premier of Canada (by the way, when is Sir Robert coming home?), declares that the Government is pledged unalterably to public ownership of railways and that public ownership has come to stay.
It says further on:
Sir Thomas White and Mr. Rowell broadly insinuate that the Canadian Pacific railway's fear of public ownership is the main-spring behind all movements in opposition to their socialistic policy.
Per contra, many men are beginning to wonder what is the pressure behind this anxious haste to involve the country in new railway obligations, at this time of financial and industrial crisis. Once it was "" Cox can't wait."" Who is it who is in such a hurry now?
That, I think, expresses pretty generally the sentiment of the people of this country. The Canadian people are, I believe, in favour of the nationalization of this railway; they are in favour of efficient management of this railway. Many people believe that if this railway is efficiently managed, it will be in a position in the near future, when we get more immigration into Canada to develop the land, to decrease western freight rates and freight rates generally throughout Canada.
Since this road has come into the hands of the Government the rates have been increased, and we have been spending large sums of money without any detailed information as to the purposes of the expenditure. There is no doubt that the people will get tired of this kind of tiling and there is absolutely no doubt that they will hold the Government accountable- afcountable to the extent that they will vote them out, perhaps at the next election. But that is not soon enough to save the railway situation for the people of Canada, and unless the Government are willing to lay all their, cards on the table and give this House all the information that has been asked for there will be a suspicion in the minds of a great many people in this country that they are not treating this question fairly and honestly; and once there is that suspicion there will be inefficiency in the management and lack of oo-operation among the people of this country. This undertaking has every possibility of success; it is already owned by the people and if the people are satisfied that the money they are paying in passenger and freight

rates on this railroad is all going into the treasury of Canada and is being honestly expended, naturally they will want to patronize the railway in preference to the Canadian Pacific or any other road, and then it will only be a matter of time before their patronage of the National railway will make it a profitable undertaking. I think possibly my hon. friend from Red Deer (Mr. Clark) and myself are about the only two men in the House who hold the view that this undertaking will be profitable. I can see a great future for it in developing the western country; that is, if lines are laid down for the honest purp&se of developing the country, and not for political purposes. There is no reason why this railway should have the preference over another road running into the same territory. For instance, if the Canadian Pacific can build a road into a certain territory cheaper than the National road, and can give a cheaper and better service, there should be no hesitation on the part of the Railway Committee of this House in granting the Canadian Pacific a charter to construct in that territory; let us have the competition. If, on the other hand, the Canadian National railway can develop the territory more cheaply and give a better service than the Canadian Pacific, there should be no hesitation on the part of the Railway Committee in saying that the Canadian Pacific shall not go into that territory. But we must be honest with ourselves, honest with the undertaking, and honest with the Canadian Pacific. Give both roads a chance to develop along their natural lines; let them both develop their natural territory, so that we may have cheaper Tates, efficiency in management, and a development of the territory to the best advantage. When we develop the territory the traffic will be created that will make the road 'pay.
One of the objections I had to the renewal of these blank Charters was that there are any amount of corporations in Western Canada holding large blocks of vacant land for speculative purposes, and who will use all possible pressure to get the Canadian National Railway to build in their territory and develoip their lands. If the road builds in that territory the land's will be advanced in value by the people's money, and at the expense of the producer, who will go in there after the railway is built and have to pay an increased price for this land. To my mind, the main essential in our railway problem is to free the land from the speculators; get immigration into the country; get people to produce on the land,
and you will- make the railway profitable. Some hon. members opposite have criticised the late Administration for the cost of the National Transcontinental. It would seem, when they speak of railways, they cannot help criticising the Laurier Administration for assisting in the development of the railway policy of 'this country. They say that the National Transcontinental cost upwards of $200,000,000. Let me tell hon. members that if the National Transcontinental did cost $200,000,000, or in that neighbourhood, it was paid for out of revenue, and that when this Government came into power the national debt, including the Transcontinental, amounted to less than $400,000,000. I might also tell them that when the 'Canadian Northern wanted to build from Edmonton to the coast, through British Columbia down to Vancouver, and parallel to the 'Canadian Pacific, the Liberal Government at Ottawa refused to grant them a charter for that road. What did the Canadian Northern do? They got a charter from the Government of the province of British Columbia.
The Government of British Columbia-I do not wish to mix politics with railways, and no hon. member can say that I ever said that any one person was responsible for the railway situation, except perhaps when some one asked me a question-the Government of British Columbia guaranteed the bonds of that road, which duplicated the Canadian Pacific practically for 200 miles from west of Edmonton to the coast. It was the most expensive construction the Canadian Northern ever had. I do not think it is good business for the people of Canada to try to cover up our responsibility by saying that it was a Liberal or a Conservative Government that was responsible for the national railway situation to-day. We have to face the situation, and I think the solution is feasible and quite workable. But we must get the railways out of the hands of the politicians, out of the hands of the men who made a failure of them, and into the hands of railway operators.
When the question was raised here a few days ago of having representatives of labour on the board, it was objected that that would be unconstitutional and could not work. Now we are doing something that is far more unconstitutional. We are taking out of the hands of the Auditor General the supervision of the expenditure of Canada's money, and as we are going to that length, I cannot see any reason why we cannot have on the board representatives of labour.

Therefore it is incorrect to say that the Government is handing over to ""a few gentlemen in Toronto"" the control and administration of the hundred or more million dollars which my hon. friend has mentioned.
Let me put this to him-the Canadian Pacific Railway Company conducts much larger operations than the Canadian National Railway system as today constituted, and yet we find the shareholders of that company, comprising men of the highest business experience and standing,-many of them residing in Great Britain, and in the United States, as well as in Canada,-do not hesitate to entrust to a few gentlemen in Montreal the administration and control of the funds of that great system. I submit that the two cases are absolutely on all fours if we are to adopt the corporate principle of administration, as we are proposing to do in this Bill. I do not believe that any hon. gentleman would rise in this House-certainly not the hon. member who has spoken (Mr. Fielding)-and charge any misfeasance on the part of the board of directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. So far as I know they administer that great system most capably _ and most honestly. And what the Government is seeking to do as a matter of administration, with a view of promoting the highest efficiency and economy, is to constitute a board of directors, responsible to the Dominion Government, who will administer the affairs of the
Canadian National Railway system and receive its revenue and cause to be properly paid out its expenditures in accordance with the practice which is adopted in efficient' railway administration in all parts of the world.
I pointed out to the hon. member (Mr. Fielding) when he raised this question in Committee, that there were two modes of administration, either of which might be adopted by the Government, in connection with these railways which have come into our possession. We might directly administer them through the Department of Railways, which is under the direct control of the Minister of Railways, a member of the Government, as the Intercolonial Railway has been administered in the past. Those railways wo.uld then be administered precisely as the Department of Railways is administered, as the Department of Customs is administered, as the Post Office Department is administered; as all other departments of the Government are to-day administered. The other way, and the one that we have chosen-and which I shall submit is the one which we should choose in the circumstances-is by administering through the agency of a joint stock company, a holding company, which will either hold the physical property of these railway companies, or control it through the holding of the capital stock.
In the first place, it has been necessary for the Government to adopt the corporation system in connection with the administration of railway companies which have outstanding bond issues, by reason of their having been financed and administered on the corporation principle in the past. It was pointed out when we took over the 'Canadian Northern Railway system that if we divested it of its corporate character and took over its physical properties by expropriation, we should at once cause to become due and payable many of the trust mortgages securing issues amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. We should thus lose the benefit of all past financing, and we should have to provide in cash an amount representing the value of the physical properties of the Canadian Northern Railway system. The same argument would apply to the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway system and to the Grand Trunk Railway system of Canada should we take them over. In the case of the Intercolonial Railway Company, the Dominion Government has owned the physical properties, and if the Canadian National Railway

Company should in the future take over the Intercolonial they would take over the physical properties of the road. No difficulty arises in that case as to outstanding bond issues, for there are none; the road has been owned directly by the Government of Canada and not through the intermediary or agency of a joint stock company.
There is a further reason why it is necessary that we should adopt a joint stock system in administering these great railway properties. In the public mind the idea is firmly embedded that direct Government administration and control of government-owned railways results in abuse through the exercise of political patronage. A great deal may he said for that view. Personally I have been impressed with what has been put forth by the hon. member (Mr. Fielding): That if the Government owns a railway system, whether in fee simple or by the ownership of stock, it is the proprietor and must be responsible for the administration of that system. I agree with that. If the Canadian National Railway Company, as administered by the nominees of the Government, is not a success, undoubtedly there will be a reflection upon the Government of the day. The Government of the day will be criticised for lack of success or for inefficiency of the administration of that system. That follows from the fact that the Government is the owner of the system-although the form is that of a corporation-an4 from the fact that its administration is in the hands of those appointed by the Government and whom the Government may, for cause, remove. But in order to prevent the exercise of patronage in connection with a system of such great importance kf Canada, it has been provided that instead of direct administration by the Government, the administration shall be through a board of directors consisting of representative and capable men in whom the Government, Parliament and the country have confidence. I said the other day, and I say now, that the success of public ownership in Canada will largely depend upon the standing, ability and character of the men selected to administer. Public ownership in Canada will have public support in direct proportion to the favourable impression which is made upon the people by the nominees of the Government, who will administer for the people.
Having laid down the principle that for a system such as this it is necessary-unavoidable, if the best results are to be obtained that the mode of administration

shall be through a corporation rather than direct, I come to the gist of the amendment proposed and of the argument put forward by the hon. member (Mr. Fielding). When this Bill was in Committee the hon. member directed attention to section 16. I said at the time, and I say now, thaj I always give great weight to any argument put forward in this House by the hon. member; and I did give his suggestion, at that time and subsequently, my best and most attentive consideration. More than that, I took it up with the responsible officers of my own department, the Auditor General's Department, and the Railway Department, with a view to seeing, so far as I could ascertain; what weight should be attached to the argument put forward and how far, if to any extent, it would be possible to meet the views of the hon. member. When the hon. member was speaking in Committee I was of the opinion that the proposal was impracticable-I do not say, impossible, but impracticable-from the standpoint of efficient, and especially of economical, administration. Adopting, as we do, the policy of administering through a corporation, to carry out my hon. friend's suggestion would mean complete duplication of the entire accounting, clerical and audit staff of the Canadian National Railway system. My hon. friend has said that we are giving public ownership a bad start. Well, we should indeed give it a bad start if we provided that, in competition, as it will be with the Canadian Pacific Railway system, it should incur a double set of costs of so important a character as those which I have indicated.
My hon. friend says it is an essential principle of Government administration that revenues shall be received into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and paid out under the safeguards afforded by the Civil Service and the Audit Office. I agree with my hon. friend with regard to the general principle; I agree that when the administration is directly that of the Government, that principle does and should apply. But where, for convenience and for efficiency of administration and in order to remove all possibility of political patronage, we deliberately adopt a commission system or a system of a board of directors whom we appoint, who engage their staffs and who are responsible for administration, then we are justified in-I shall not say a departure from the principle, but the adoption of another principle which experience has shown is safe, namely, administration with the safeguards afforded by corporate management. Take the Intercolonial Railway.

In the past the revenues of the Intercolonial railway have been received, as any hon. friend says, into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and from the Consolidated Revenue Fund there have been checked out the salaries, wages and other expenses of the railway. From inquiries which I have made, I. am able to say that the audit which the Dominion Government has made with respect to the Intercolonial has been of the most imperfect and perfunctory character-and necessarily so. Officials of the Intercolonial Railway Company have received the money into Consolidated Fund and have paid it out under letters of credit.
In other words, the officials of 4 p.m. the Intercolonial Railway Company-that is, of the Dominion Government-have done precisely what the officials of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company do; they have received the money and paid it out under the safeguards of audit and of the other checks established by efficient administration. So that in the Intercolonial, which the Dominion Government directly owns and in respect of which the principles that my hon. friend has referred to have been in effect, we find precisely what we find in connection with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, namely, that the officers of the road receive the money and pay it out. iHow could we adopt, in connection with the mode of administration that we have selected, the method put forward by my hon. friend?
In the first place, in order to carry on corporation administration with regard to the receipt and payment out of moneys, there must be a large clerical staff, an accounting staff and an audit staff. 'Where are they? There are spread over this immense system practically from the Atlantic to the Pacific, accountants, clerks, agents for the receipt of money,, travelling and other auditors. If all the money received from the Canadian National Railway system is to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and checked out by the officers of the Finance Department or under letters of credit issued to the officers of other departments and subject to the control of the Auditor 'General, that means a complete duplication of the services to which I have referred. Therefore, as I have said, the suggestion put forward by the hon. member is impracticable and uneconomical, impracticable because the administrative machinery, of the Dominion Government to-day is not adequate, although it might be said it could be made adequate to do the work efficiently-and
there is no use in doing the work in any other way than efficently-to check tup all the receipts and expenditures of the Canadian National Railway system-uneconomical, because it duplicates for the Canadian National Railway system all the services that I have mentioned.
My hon. friend referred to the British system, and without knowledge of the facts, I wish to ask him this question, because he may know. The British Government administers through its various departments, as we do here, and the hon. member was quite correct, so far as I am aware, in stating that all moneys are received into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and paid out subject to the cheques of the Civil Service. Does my hon. friend know whether the accounts of the Suez Canal Company, the shares of which are owned by the British Government, are submitted in detail to the British House of Commons, whether the appropriation is voted in full, or whether that is dealt with as a separate corporation? I do not know.

The Australian jGovernment own the railways, the physical property; they built them, I am told, in the first place, and consequently the Australian railway situation is on all fours with the situation which exists here respecting the administration of the several departments of the Government.
My hon. friend has spoken about turning over the administration to certain men. All administration must be turned over to certain men; indeed, we are entrusting officers of the Government here with administration of a most important character, and while the administration of the Canadian National Railway system is through a corporation every member of the staff, every clerk or every agent is, in substance and in fact, a Government employee. Further, the administration of that system can, as it will, be subjected every year in this House to the most minute scrutiny and searching investigation, because, as I stated when this Bill was in Committee, if the Dominion Government pays the deficits each year, then the Dominion Government is interested in

every cent that comes in and every cent that goes out. The Government would not only expect but welcome the criticism which must be made in Parliament of the operations as disclosed by the balance sheet at the end of the fiscal year and would expect that Parliament would obtain such information in such detail as is desired with regard to the whole administration of that system. If that be not so, then suspicion will inevitably be thrown upon the administration of that railway administration.
My hon. friend made the rather startling statement that if there is a deficit, these gentlemen at Toronto will come down to the Minister of Finance and say: You pay out the amount of the deficit without regard to Parliament at all. That is true in one sense and not in another. Under section 16, if there is a deficit at the end of a fiscal year, the Dominion Government makes good that deficit; otherwise, the railway system would have to borrow money for the purpose of making it good, or if they could not borrow the money, they would have to suspend. The reason for that is that the Government is the owner of this system. If there is a deficit at the end of the fiscal year, the Minister of Finance is authorized to make good that deficit, subject to this provision that the amount paid by the Minister of Finance under this section shall be included in the Estimates submitted to Parliament at its first session following the close of such fiscal year; and in the event of a surplus existing at the close of any fiscal year such surplus shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
It is open to Parliament at each session to review the operations and the entire administration of the Canadian National Railway system as to deficit or as to surplus. The gist of the matter is that, although the form is a corporation, the Dominion Government owns the system, and that every one connected with it from the board of directors down to the humblest man in their employ is in reality a Government official in the sense that he must be held to strict account, first to the board of directors, and through them to the Government of Canada for his action in connection with the work entrusted to him.
My hon. friend said that we are starting this off with two handicaps, one being closure. I agree generally with the observations of the hon. gentleman as regards the inexpediency of bringing in closure unless it is clear there is obstruction, and this does not refer to my hon. friend, because the criticism which he made of the Bill

was such as might not only fairly, but very properly be put forward. His argument was listened to with the greatest attention, and as I said. I took the trouble to consider it, not only at the time, but the next day, and to discuss it with the officials of my own department, of the Auditor General's Department and of the Railway Department, because I desired that it should be very fully considered. And it was my intention, if the Bill had continued in Committee, to speak further to the argument of the hon.' member, because I had stated that the matter would have further consideration. But we all know what happened. There was obstruction-I will not say on the part of all hon. members opposite, because that would not be correct-but there was undoubtedly obstruction.

Hansard, page 1820, of the present session. At page 1822 he says again:
I happen to be against public ownership. 1 stated on the second reading that X was against it; that I was in favour of private ownership and public control.
Then at page 1825 he says:
I want my good friends to see that in spite of my opposition to public ownership I want to help the system as much as I can.
The hon. member for Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe), who is a tower of strength in his party, said at page 1818:
Those who believe that nationalization means necessarily liberty and freedom are mistaken. In many respects it is the very opposite of liberty. Its purpose is to kill competition and erect a bureaucratic state.
I put forward these citations as representing the views of hon. gentlemen opposite because it was stated that hon. members opposite were not opposed to the principles of public ownership.
As I stated I have no objection whatever to a public man being in favour of private as opposed to public ownership. But it is essential to know what a public man's views are; and in the case of a party in this House, to know what their views are upon the subject. I submit that, from the quotations which I have read, it is perfectly clear that the leaders of hon. gentlemen opposite are opposed to the principle of public ownership.

The hon. member for Shelburne and Queens (Mr. Fielding) said that the other handicap was that we had failed to associate with public ownership all the proper safeguards. I submit that I have answered that fully. I would call the attention of the hon. member to what I believe to be the fact: that the greatest example of public ownership in Canada is the Hydro-Electric Commission under the chairmanship of Sir Adam Beck. I cannot say positively because I have not made the explicit inquiry, but I believe that the commission is administered in the same manner that we propose to administer the Canadian National railway. . I do not believe that there is submitted to the Legislature of Ontario an estimate of the full amount required by the Hydro-Electric Commission with every detail of expenditure as is the case with the departments of the Government.
I submit that my hon. friend is mistaken in his view that there is any departure in this Bill from the principles of sound public administration. There is a change in mode but the change is that which is imposed upon us by the necessities of corporation management and for the same reason that it is imposed upon the Canadian Pacific shareholders who entrust to a board nominated by them the administration of the company's system of which they are the owners.

The people of Canada have viewed with a feeling of distrust and dislike the fact that when the Acting Minister of Justice-for whom as a lawyer I have great respect-was conducting this Bill through the House he had seated beside him one of the lesser luminaries of that constellation of legal lights which clustered for years around Mackenzie and Mann. Not only that, but he told us that the Bill had been drafted by what I might call the sun of that syStem of legal lights, Mr. Zebulon A. Lash. These gentlemen are lawyers for whom all Canadian lawyers have great re spect. But we would prefer that Government ownership of this great system started without such apparent close connection be-

tween Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann and the Government. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that the people of Canada are not grateful to Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann for their railroad operations in this country? We find them feeling, rightly or wxongly, that the level of public life has not been raised, but rather debased by the operations of those gentlemen.
The Acting Prime Minister took considerable time in defending the corporate form of this company which is to run our railways. The hon. member for Shelburne and Queens never attacked the corporate form- so all that argument was absolutely beside the point; the hon. member asked that the control of Parliament over the moneys ol the people should be retained. The Acting Prime Minister made a comparison between the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. He said that shareholders, widely distributed, gave the conduct of the Canadian Pacific Railway into the bands of the directors; and his argument was: Why. cannot the people of Canada give the conduct of the Canadian Northern Railway just as completely into the hands of those nominated by the shareholders of this company? There is only one answer to that argument, but it is a very complete answer-that the private owners of the shares of the Canadian Pacific Railway are dealing with their own property and have the right to name whom they will as their directors; while this Government is dealing, not with its own property, but with the property of the people of Canada. And we, sitting on this side of the House, at least, say that in dealing with the property of the people of Canada there shall be thrown around that dealing all the safeguards and protection that British traditions and British experience have shown to be wise and necessary.
Another argument advanced by the Acting Prime Minister was that it would save the duplication of auditing. I really think that that is not a serious argument. No one pretends that if the audit of this railroad is carried on by the officers of the Auditor General that another audit will have to be made by the railway company's officials. One audit should be sufficient.
My hon. friend the Acting Prime Minister also brought forward the fact that after a deficit occurs Parliament will have the right to appropriate moneys to meet it. That is quite right, that is left to us. It reminds me of what a Radical member once said in the British House of Commons. ""The King generally talks about

'my army' and 'my navy'; but he always talks about 'the national debt'."" And our friends, the directors of this railway company, may possibly talk about ""our engines and our rolling stock""; but when the deficit comes it will be ""the deficit of the people of Canada.""
I now come to the least enthusiastic argument of the Acting Prime Minister. He said, ""I believe,-I am not sure,-that the Hydro-Electric Commission of Ontario carries on its business as regards the Parlia-[DOT] ment of the province in the same way as we propose that this commission or company should carry on its business as regards the Parliament of Canada."" I know how busy the Acting Prime Minister is. I spoke in the House the other night of the inhumanity	Jiyernment of twentythree members allowing him rto>
do-nt.vo men's work. But really when he conies to tell us what we should do in regard to perhaps the greatest national undertaking that this country has ever assumed, he should be able to give us better arguments than his beliefs; I think we should have accurate information.
Public ownership is a matter on which honest men equally informed may hold different opinions. We have before us the great public ownership scheme in which the Government has embarked, and it is necessary that every man whatsoever his preconceived notions on public ownership may be, give that scheme all his support. But let not the Government endeavour to make political capital out of the fact that there are some men on this side of the House who are not in favour of Government ownership. I believe if we counted heads we would find among the supporters of the Government just as many who are not enthusiastic for government ownership. Government ownership is a principle that I wish I could enthusiastically support, for it seems to me in theory to be right. The idea that a railway is in essence a monopoly, that it can only be successful if it is a monopoly, and that all monopolies should be owned or at least be controlled by the people, appeals to me. But I cannot overlook the facts before me. What are they? Government ownership was tried in the United States, and it ran up tremendous deficits; government ownership was also tried in Great Britain and it ran up tremendous deficits. I know that government ownership was a great success in regard to marine insurance in Great Britain. When the war broke out ships stood in harbour, they did not dare go out because there

were no insurance companies strong enough to insure their cargoes and hulls. The Government stepped in and insured them, and thus did a great service for the nation and the Allies, and it made a handsome profit out of the business. I asked the Government the other night whether they could tell me if the Government of Great Britain paid the premiums into the Consolidated Fund, but I have had no answer.
Now, we on this side of the House are prepared to give this government ownership plan, as outlined by this Bill, a fair field. We wish to see it succeed. We would have no patriotic feelings in our bosoms if we did not entertain that wish, because I do not know what will be the financial future of this country if this plan does not succeed. But what I do say is-tl	' he Government,
wim all [lie difficulties inherent in the situation, and in the light of recent experiments in public ownership, not only on this side of the Atlantic, 'but on the other, would be well advised to follow the sage and experienced counsel given to them by the bon. member for Shelburne and Queens.

I wanted to put myself absolutely right before the House and the country when the Acting Prime Minister said that I declared myself against public ownership the year before, and I quoted what I said a year ago, which is this:
It is important for the people that we should have some conception of what we are doing. If this were a meeting of directors-
And I was talking of the Minister of Railways coming before the 'House- with his *Estimates.
-it would not be a very cheerful one. The directors and shareholders would have discovered that we were spending away up in the millions in the development and working of the road, but that we have made no money. We are in debt. If we were ordinary directors and shareholders of a road we would have to put our hands down in our pockets to find money in order to make betterments and to run the road, and that would not be a cheerful prospect. However, we are new beginners in this enterprise. I was never in favour of Government ownership

I said that over a year ago. I am honest about it. Life is too dear, peace too sweet, approval of my own conscience is too dear to me to bother with 'anything but what I believe.
I am in favour of it now-
That is what I said a year ago.
-as I think private enterprise will be better in these matters. Particularly in colonization and development will private enterprise and private energy do much better than Government ownership, but by the force of circumstances, we are in this net, and we must stay

in it and make the most of it-that is the way I view it.
I went on to say that I hoped the minister would come back to us the next year with a statement that -would compare favourably with the position of the Canadian Pacific. T said that I knew of no reason why the minister could not get just as good men to run the road as the Canadian Pacific had. Now, I have not changed my position one wit from what it was a year ago. In discussing this Bill I had no occasion to say anything about private ownership. It was merely a question of how best to handle the property, that we already had, and it was not fair for the Acting Prime Minister to switch off into a discussion of private ownership, because ' that was not involved in the question at alb When I was addressing myself to the people of the West, not only last year but some time before, I said that if the people of the West wanted the development of railways, wanted enterprise in building lines in different parts of the West, they would be disappointed in Government ownership. Why did I say that? I said it because the province from which I come and parts of the province of Quebec had had fifty years of Government ownership of the Intercolonial, and during that time not one inch of branch line had been built in the province of Nova Scotia. I had a right therefore to say to the people of the West that it was better for them to have the energy and enterprise of private ownership. I knew what the Canadian Pacific had done in the West, and I knew what Mackenzie and Mann would do if they had the money. I knew the country would develop more rapidly under private ownership of railways.

He is a brainy business man, and I think I will leave it to him to find the alternative. I say that we are discussing this business, and we have a right to discuss it; we have a right to stick to the real business before us, and not switch off into a discussion of public versus private ownership. We already have the road, and all we have to do is to determine what principles shall be applied in the management of it. That is the real question before us, and I cannot understand how the minister could get away from it. Why, what do we see in the very preamble of the Bill, which is the 
context of the Act, explaining what the Act is about? The preamble says:
Whereas His Majesty on behalf of the Dominion of Canada has acquired control of the Canadian Northern Railway Company and of the various constituent and subsidiary companies comprising the Canadian Northern System.
The preamble says we have acquired the road. We are now simply dealing with the management of it. I have stated as clearly as I can my own position on government ownership. If the people of the West are to have government owmership, I trust that they will have a more cheerful experience than the people of the province of Nova Scotia have had, because our experience has not been good. I sincerely hope that theirs will be better, and that government ownership of railways will give them a better development than it has given to the Maritime Provinces. I was quoted by the Acting Prime Minister this afternoon as having said some years ago that that was one of the reasons why I did not think the good people of the West would be improving their position by substituting for the enterprise and energy of private ownership government ownership as we had experienced it in the East. Perhaps what was a failure with us will be a success in the West. I hope so; I hope that as years go by matters will improve in connection not only with government-owned railways, but everything else.
We were held up to contempt and obloquy the other night, and spoken of as traitors more or less to our own interests, because we were supposed to have said something in favour of the Canadian Pacific. Personally, I did not hear anybody say anything in favour of the Canadian Pacific. I did hear the' Acting Prime Minister say to-day that the Canadian Pacific had served the country faithfully and well. Now, if the Canadian Pacific has served the country faithfully and well and given us a splendid service, should a public man in this House be found fault with for saying a good word on behalf of that institution, of which the Acting Prime Minister speaks se well? Obviously, no stigma can attach to any hon. member in this House who may have said something favourable to the Canadian Pacific.
The amendment before us cannot possibly have taken the Government by surprise. This Bill was founded upon a resolution, which was discussed very fully. When the resolution was before the House I told the minister that I could not agree to the principle of taking away from Parliament control of the revenue of Canada, and that

I would continue to oppose that principle. I still adhere to that position. I believe that Parliament should know-whether it takes a few more clerks or not, matters nothing-how the money is coming in and w'here it is coming from, and at the last accounting we should have an opportunity of saying how the account shall be settled. That has been the principle that has been upheld and practised in the old land for hundreds of years, and is the principle that prevails there to-day. It has been explained to us by the hon. member for Shelburne and Queens (Mr. Fielding) that although the principle was departed from for a short time prior to 1854, since that year the practice has been followed in the old country oi not spending a single farthing of the public money until the expenditure' has been approved by Parliament. I think that is a safe principle to follow. If we are going to relegate the management of our railways to an independent concern over w'hich we have no control, what is the use of Parliament at all? It is proposed that we should put thousands of miles of railway and millions and, in time, billions of money beyond the control of Parliament. If we are to do that, why should we meet here at all? Why not let ns meet one year and grant a charter to some private corporation to run the Whole business of the country and then slam the door and go home, leaving that corporation to run the business? If the principle is good in one thing, -it is good in another. If this proposal is the proposal par excellence that it is painted to be in connection with the handling of railways, surely the same principle holds good in other things and can be applied to every department of Government business. I submit that the Canadian people or the British people or any other well-governed people would not for a moment listen to such a proposition. It is better to stand by the old principle. Let us have absolute control over our own revenue, and let us spend it as the wisdom of Parliament may decide. If section 16 of the Act had said that the deficit would be made good after the money had been voted by Parliament, it would not be so bad; but it does not say that. It says that when a deficit occurs the manager of the company may simply walk into the office of the Finance Minister and say: ""I am $10,000,000 or $20,000,000 short this year; kindly give me your cheque for that amount, under the provisions of section 16 of the Act.""
If the minister should question him about it he says: ""You have nothing to say about
it; by virtue of this Act of Parliament I am entitled to the money, you have no further control over it; give me your cheque so that I may get the money."" It is the privilege of the minister, six months afterwards when he is bringing down his Esti- * mates to say: ""We have been obliged to pay out $20,000,000."" What are we going to do about it? The money is spent. It is a most ridiculous thing to say that we have any control over it at all. We have given it away in advance. We have expropriated this money out of the pockets of the people and we have passed it over to this company. Afterwards we are told that we have the opportunity of sitting down wisely together and reading that so much money was spent last year, and we have simply to pass this ex post facto legislation that will confirm the action of the minister in handing over the cheque. We believe that there should be the most minute inquiry into the proceedings of this company. Where is the machinery under this Act to furnish any such inquiry? There is not a line or a word in this Act to say that the Auditor General has anything to do about it, that the Auditor General can report upon or make any inquiry, and there is not a vestige of authority to .submit these accounts to the Public Accounts Committee and let them come under the control of Parliament.
As a last word let me say that the Acting Prime Minister seemed to justify the action of the Government in putting on closure to prevent further discussion of this Bill. The very last man who made a speech of any length was himself just within three or four hours of the application of closure. The hon. gentleman spoke for about an hour and a half before closure was applied.
Is it to be supposed by the Canadian people that it was necessary for the Acting Prime Minister to speak for that length of time explaining and defending the Bill before closure was applied? If a proper and useful discussion was being carried on by the Acting Prime Minister then surely there could not have been very much obstruction, because obstruction aims at keeping the House from doing things that should be done. But, within a few hours of the closure being applied it was thought necessary in order that the Bill might be properly understood by the House, that the minister should make a speech for an hour and a half. And yet, he told us to-day that closure was necessary. He told us the night before he made that speech, when the hon. member for Shelburne and Queens (Mr. Fielding) was speaking, that

clause 16 was to stand. He said that it was a most serious objection that was taken to it and that it would receive consideration. What did the Acting Prime Minister do? He left the House after he had made his long speech and he never gave a second's consideration to this clause of the Bill. He never gave the Committee or the House an opportunity of dealing with it any more, but he applied the closure, and the section to which he had promised serious consideration was never considered, and the closure was applied without considering it. Is he going to tell the people that it was necessary to apply the closure without carrying out what he had promised?
I submit that the revenue derived from the operation of public railways should be absolutely under the control of Parliament and that the motion moved by the hon. member for Shelburne and Queens embodies the only method by which this Bill should be dealt with and which brings the operation of these railways and public ownership absolutely and properly under the control of this House.

The hon. the leader of the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie) has struggled manfully with a situation, which he, himself, feels to be difficult. He had every appearance of a man who was struggling with difficulties that he reared himself, started off and he said that he believed in a man who was not carried away with every breath of doctrine. I quite believe in the honesty of my hon. friend; I quite believe that he wants to think that he is such a man and I quite agree that he is nearly always such a man, but he has given evidence of having fallen a little short upon this occasion.
In regard to Government ownership, 1 must say that I think the whole matter does not arise on the discussion at all. But I watched the proceedings very carefully on a certain Friday night and a certain Monday night; I saw my hon. friend rise and read what he stated was his attitude in regard to Government ownership in the previous session, and my recollection is that he led the House to believe that he read it to show that he had not changed and that he was in that position still. If

that be his position it is a perfectly honourable one, although I did think that on the Monday evening he showed just a little sign of wavering. I may have been wrong in my impression; I should have been glad to have believed that he had stuck to his position of Friday night. 1 do think at the present moment that that was still his position on Friday night, but I know his attitude did not convey the same impression to the House on Friday night that it did on Monday night. I am not impressed, nor edified, when he stands up and wants us to think of him as a man who is not carried away by new breaths of doctrine.
In regard to what my hon. friend said about the closure, and whether there was obstruction or not, I should apologise for referring to this matter in view of the debate we had on Friday night and on Monday night. But I think I can give an illustration that even my hon. friend would have difficulty in getting over as to the existence of obstruction. My hon. friend from Pontiac (Mr. Cahill) rose, with a broad smile which indicated a good deal of internal amusement at the role he was playing, and I am perfectly sure that he said ten times in not fewer than as many minutes, that he was seeking information. Well, that is a perfectly harmless remark, and the most of us might have agreed with the need for information. But when he repeated that statement ten times within ten minutes I submit to my hon. friend the . leader of the Opposition that that was coining pretty near obstruction. I do not want to press the point. We all know what obstruction is. Needless repetition has been the definition which has been given to obstruction in the Parliament of Great Britain. I do not think the hon. member for Pontiac would not say that he was needlessly repeating himself when he said again and again in my hearing that he rose for information, that he had not the information and that he wanted it.
Now, with regard to the matter before the House, Mr. Speaker, I should always wish to give the utmost attention to anything that was advanced here by my hon. friend from Shelburne and Queens (Mt. Fielding). It may be conceded that this is a new departure or partakes of the nature of a new departure, but I cannot help thinking that that is more apparent than real. As to its being a new departure, Sir, I would just say this: That not only this country, but the world is in the midst of new departures, and we cannot help ourselves. We are in the midst of new

departures, and any man who thinks that we have not to try and be prepared to deal with new departures in the present condition of this country and of the world, is in danger of rapidly finding himself a back number in any guidance he gives to the affairs of the nation.
'I think that my hon. friend the Acting Prime Minister gave a most lucid, most cogent, and most forcible argument to the House, and II am bound to say, in all honesty, that it carried to me complete conviction. There were the two methods of dealing with this question after we decide upon public ownership; and even my hon. friend the leader of the Opposition is constrained to admit that such is the condition in wh'ich these roads are, we are bound to decide upon it. Then I take it, either we were to administer the Canadian National Railroad as the Intercolonial has been administered, or we were to adopt the corporation method. Now, with regard to the Intercolonial railway, I must ask hon. gentlemen opposite (who are better acquainted with it than I am, who have lived in that part of the country and watched its operations) is it not a fact that under all Governments that road has reeked and smelt with political patronage? Is not that the case? If it be the case can this Government and Parliament lightly think of adopting a method for the Canadian National railroad whidh has led to the wholesale use of patronage in the limited experiment that we have been making on the Intercolonial in regard to this great question of Government ownership? The Acting Prime (Minister says the Government has deliberately chosen the other method. For what purpose? To get rid, if possible, of political patronage; and if the Government does not get directors who will co-operate with it in this matter, it will be brought to very strict account by the people of this ,country. I believe that here is the crux of the whole thing. Let the Government say to its directors: We want this railroad run upon business lines, and we want the best men put in for doing any specific work in connection with it, and we do not want politics to interfere. If the Government does less than that it will very rapidly be brought to task by the people of this country. If the Government does that, I have 'Stated my previous faith in Canada's ability to sustain this railroad, and to build it up to a degree of wealth and efficiency equal to that of the Canadian Pacific, and the two railroads will be part of the wonder which the Canada of the future is going to be in the world. The whole thing depends
upon getting the right men to carry the undertaking out-getting men in whose trustworthiness and ability you can have confidence, and Canada being behind the road it is 'bound to be a success. If we do not produce, and cannot produce, such-men in Canada import them. Get honest, trustworthy and able men. Tell them they have got to run this, as a railway proposition, to success, and that they are not to consider political questions at all. Then I have such confidence in my country that I have faith in the future of this road.
As to the control of Parliament, I have said that this is a new departure. I think that in the case of Britain's handling of the Indian Accounts there may be a precedent for this line of action. But we do not forfeit, that I can see, any of our rights as a -Parliament to look into the way the roads are being run. Something has to be done on trust in connection with such a large concern. Do the Canadian Pacific shareholders do nothing on trust in regard to their railroad, one of the biggest concerns in the world? Have the shareholders to do nothing on trust in connection with that road? Surely we can find men in Canada- or our politics and our public life are corrupt beyond description-surely we can find men to do for the nation what the directors of the Canadian Pacific are doing for the shareholders of that railway. I hope we can. I hope so from the bottom of my heart, for the sake of the future of the enterprise, for the sake of the future of the public life of Canada, for the sake of the prosperity, progress, and real welfare of this great Dominion. But I would appeal to my hon. friends opposite to taxe this attitude and force home from time to time -and I will help them in doing it if it is necessary-the points that I have made in my brief utterances. Force home these points, and criticise and observe all you can, but let us give Canada and her railroad a fair trial.

I undoubtedly stated a dozen times that we had been asking for information that we had not got, or could not get; and when this Bill was subjected to the closure there were at least ten of the clauses in it that had not been debated in this House, many of the most-important clauses in the most important piece of legislation that has perhaps been before Parliament for some years. The clause to which my hon. friend (Mr. Fielding) has moved an amendment was under discussion on a Monday, the first evening of the debate. I was not present on that occasion. I must confess, Mr. Speaker, that when I heard that the Government and Mr. Lash were co-operating with the Mackenzie and Mann group it gave me such a headache I was unable to be here that evening. Had I been here I would have spoken about that clause as I did when the resolution came before the House, because there is nothing about the amendment of my hon. friend (Mr. Fielding) which renders it impossible to adopt.
The Acting Prime Minister makes the statement that you will have to duplicate the staff. Nothing of the kind. Every big corporation-for instance, the Canadian Pacific Bailway-employ auditors and then have an outside audit as well. The auditing staff of the Canadian National Railways could be under the jurisdiction of the Auditor General, and one audit would suffice for the company and for the country.
The hon. member for Red Deer (Mr. Clark) said that I was obstructing. I heard other hon. members say the same thing. Perhaps I did not make myself clear in some instances. When we were dealing in Committee with section 17, relating to the date of the annual meeting, which is to be held in April, some hon. members thought that that was a matter of very little importance. It simply means this, Mr. Speaker, that if you have the annual meeting of this company on the second Thursday in April, instead of on the 31st of December, you will be getting a report-if you get one at all-presented to Parliament a year later; whereas if you made the statistical year end on the 31st of December you would get the report of the previous year's operations presented to Parliament during the session. As the section passed the Committee it is not likely the annual report will be presented to Parliament until the following

year, and it will be so far gone then that the minister in charge will simply say: ""This is last year's accounts. We have had this deficit, we have paid the money; that was a year ago, and we are doing better now."" I think that the amendment I proposed was important, Mr. Speaker. The statistical year of the Dominion ends on the 31st of December. Why not'make this National Railway system conform to it? No information was given me on that subject. There must be some reason why the Government want to have the annual meeting in April. Is it because it will not be convenient to bring the report of the company's operations before Parliament that session? I do not see how the amendment can bring about any hardship on the Government or on the management of the railway. If you have the Auditor General's Report, members of Parliament would be in a position to intelligently discuss the management of the people's railways; but there would be no such chance a year after payments have been made out of the treasury without the sanction of Parliament.
The adoption of my suggestion would entail practically no added expense. It is just as necessary to have an audit of the expenditures of a company, the directors of whom are appointed by the Government, as it is to have the expenditures of the people's representatives audited. The people are not satisfied to trust the Government or Parliament with the expenditure of money without any independent audit; so provision has been made for an Auditor General, who is independent of the Government. That being the case, surely it is just as essential that we should have an audit when the Government hand over the spending of money to a third party. There will be in the neighbourhood of one hundred million dollars spent on this enterprise, and so far as the Bill at present provides there is absolutely no provision made for an audit. I asked the Government when the Bill was under discussion if a report would be presented to Parliament, and that is one of the numerous questions to whioh I received no answer.
Now, there is not an hon. member who listened to the whole discussion on this Bill from start to finish who can tell me that the Government ever said they would bring before Parliament at any particular date a full report of the receipts and expenditures of this undertaking. I do not know whether the Government are withholding the information intentionally or not. But there are a number of things in

this Bill that do not look good to me, and they do not look good to the people. When I criticised the Bill a few days ago I was not only expressing my own opinion, in a large measure I was expressing the opinion of a great many people of the country. There is no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that there is a feeling abroad that if this enterprise is to succeed we must get clear of the Mackenzie and Mann influence, lock, stock and barrel. The gentlemen selected as directors were directors of the Canadian Northern railway, and, according to the statement of the Government, they made a failure of its management. Have the Government looked around to find competent railway men, or even public ownership enthusiasts, who would assume control of this road. It seems to me it would be the simplest thing in the world to get a body of the best railway men in Canada, pay them good salaries, and relieve them as far as possible from political control. Hon. members now say that the directors are relieved from political control. Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Railways has a string on every one of the directors; he can pull them back at will, and he does not have to come to Parliament to give any explanation of his action. I made a suggestion when the Bill was in Committee that the directors should be appointed in the same way as the members of the Railway Commission. Some hon. members asked me if I wanted to have them appointed for ten years. I replied that I did not suggest that, because possibly ten years might be too long a period to keep in office some older men in an undertaking of this kind; but I suggested they could be appointed for four or five years in much the same way as are the members of the Railway Commission. The Government would not lose control; they could always add to or withdraw from* the directorate. But those directors would feel that as long as they were giving good service their positions would be assured.
I also made the proposal that there should be a profit sharing arrangement. At present we have a commission sitting on a proposal for co-operation between capital and labour. If there is to be any cooperation it must be based on profit sharing of some kind or another. Here is the biggest undertaking that we will ever have directly under our own control vhere we can adopt a profit sharing system.
We are dealing with a road that is losing some millions of dollars. It would be a simple matter to work out a plan under which, when the road earned a certain amount, all employees of the system, the
directors included, would share in the profits.

SINCLAIR (Antigonish and Guysborough):,,'2122 COMMONS,,,"I should like to draw attention to what I think was an unintentional mistake on the part of the leader of the Government, when he said that the Bill we are now disqussing contains provisions similar to those contained in the HydroElectric Act of the province of Ontario.
I took the trouble to look up the HydroElectric Act and, although I have not had time to read it carefully, I find that such is not the case but that it is the exact opposite. It appears to contain every possible safeguard for the expenditure of money. In the first place, it provides for a controller who is not an officer of the Hydro-Electric..Commission but of the Government and who appears to occupy a position somewhat similar to that of the Auditor General here. It is his function to countersign every cheque that is issued by the Hydro-Electric Commission and no expenditure can be made except it is countersigned by the comptroller. The comptroller is responsible to the Government and it is his duty to see that every expenditure is authorized. Provision is made in the Act for an annual statement of expenditures, similar to the provision which is made here, but it does not stop there. The Act also provides for an estimate for the coming year, something that is not contained in this Bill. In order that I-may make no mistake about this, I will read one or two sections to the House. The section providing for the controller is as follows:
The Lieutenarft-Governor in Council may appoint an officer to be know as the Comptroller of the Commission who shall hold office during the pleasure of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council anid shall .countersign every cheque issued toy the Commission, tout before countersigning shall satisfy himself that the issue of the cheque is authorized1.
The Commission, through the Comptroller, shall before the 15th day of February .in each year, make to the Treasurer of Ontario an annual report for the information of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, and for the information of the Assembly, and such report shall contain, among other things, clear and comprehensive statements disclosing and exhibiting-

(a)	The actual condition as to the amount and character of the assets and liabilities (direct and indirect) of the undertakings conducted by it as on 31st December last preceding ;
(b)	The cash transactions, including receipts and disbursements for the year ending on 31st December last preceding;
(c)	The revenues, income and interest earned and the amount of the costs, expenses and other items chargeable there aigainst in connection with the operation, maintenance, administration and conduct of the undertakings controlled by it for the year ending 31st December last preceding;
Now, we come to the provision relating to the ensuing year:
(d)	The amounts, with the expected sources of the same, which it is estimated will be received in cash or its equivalent and the payments, loans and advances with the purpose of the same, which iit is contemplated shall be made in 'cash or otherwise, in the next succeeding year;
(e)	The amounts and particulars of the obligations and liabilities which it is contemplated shall be incurred in the next succeeding year;
(f)	The securities or evidence of indebtedness which it is contemplated shall be created, issued, sold or otherwise disposed of, together with the method of dealing with the same in the next succeeding year
You see, Mr. Speaker, that it is the duty of the Hydro-Electric Commission to provide the Legislature of Ontario with an estimate of the money that they expect to expend during the coming year. This Bill fails to do that. This Bill gives the board of directors power to expend money without any reference to Parliament at all. It provides that an accounting shall be given after the money is spent. That is what we object to. That is locking the stable door after the horse is stolen. The Hydro-Electric Commission has to give an estimate of every dollar it expects to spend in the ensuing year and it is authorized by the Legislature. Then, there is this other section :
Where the Legislature has appropriated money for the purposes of the Commission, such money shall be payable out of such appropriation to the Commission from time to time, upon the requisition of the Chairman of the Commission and the direction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, in such amounts and at such times as shall be stated in the requisition and direction, and this section shall have effect notwithstanding that there may be sums due from the Commission to the province and notwithstanding anything in The Audit Act contained.
This shows that the system that is in force with regard to the Hydro-Electric Commission in Ontario is exactly the system that is advocated by my hon. friend from Shelburne and Queens (Mr. Fielding). There is a provision for the accumulation
of a reserve fund but that reserve fund has to be underithe supervision of the comptroller and the cheque^ have to be signed by him. If the cheques and guards that are furnished under this Hydro-Electric Act had been contained in the Act which is now before the House, there would be no cause of complaint in regard to this matter on this side of the House and the amendment of my hon. friend from Shelburne and Queens, would not be necessary. The hon. the Leader of the Government (Sir Thomas White) cannot get any comfort at all from the system adopted by the Hydro-Electric Commission in the province of Ontario.
My hon. friend stated to the House that it is impracticable to adopt the proposition of the hon. member for iShelbume and Queens. But he does not tell us why it is impracticable. He has given no good reason. It has not been found impracticable in the case of the Intercolonial railway for the last forty years; in the case of the New Zealand railways, and in the case of the railways of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Commonwealth of Australia is a very large country. The transactions in connection with the railways are scattered over that vast continent; yet the system we advocate here -has not been found impracticable there.
, My hon. friend has said that it is impracticable, but he has not given us .good ground for that statement. The difference is that in the one case we have parliamentary control, and in the other case we have not. I also object to the provision of section 26 of this Act because it enables the company, with the approval of the Governor in Council, to bond the whole line up to $75,000 a mile. There are no bonds on the Intercolonial railway at the present time, but as I understand this Bill it gives the power to the directors of this company, with the consent of the Governor in Council, to bond some eighteen hundred miles of the Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island railways, up to the amount of $75,000 a mile. That would secure some $1-12,000,000 which they could use in building railways and railway extensions in Western Canada, or elsewhere in this country, without any consent on the part of this Parliament. The whole question is amply provided for under the existing law; we have the Audit Act which makes very careful provision in regard to the expenditure of money. The moneys paid in to the Minister of Customs, the Minister of Railways, and the Postmaster General, all become part of the consolidated revenue of Canada,

and not one dollar can be paid out without Parliamentary authority. I believe in Parliamentary control of the people's money and for that reason intend to vote for the amendment.
Mr. II. E. PEDLtOW (Renfrew South): There still seems to be a misunderstanding, even in the minds of several members of the Government including the Acting Prime Minister, in regard to the subject under discussion. As I read the measure I find that the Government already owns the railways for whose management we are endeavouring to draft rules and regulations. For instance, the preamble states:
Whereas His Majesty on behalf of the Dominion of Canada has acquired control of the Canadian Northern Railway Company-
Not that the Government is about to acquire the railway, but that it has acquired it.
-and of the various constituent and subsidiary companies comprising the Canadian Northern System, as specified in the First Schedule to this Act, and it is expedient to provide for the incorporation of a company under which the railways, works and undertakings of the companies comprised in the Canadian Northern System may be consolidated, and together with the Canadian Government Railways operated as a national railway system.
I think that very much of the discussion that has taken place is entirely beside the question. We are not discussing, and have [DOT] not been-unless forced to assume the defensive on this side-the question of the public or private ownership of the railways under consideration. We are here to devise ways and means of managing the railways that we already own, or are supposed to own-there seems to be grave doubts in the minds of hon. gentlemen opposite as to whether we really own these railways or not; in the one breath we are told that we do own them, and in the very next breath we are given to understand by members on the Government side that we are not the owners. But we are supposed, according to this Bill, to own these railways, and therefore public ownership, J submit, is not the question under discussion in this debate. I am surprised at the Acting Prime Minister insisting that we should put ourselves on record on this subject, when the question of public ownership, or otherwise, is not the issue. That hon. gentleman has accused members on this side, including the leader of the Opposition, of obstruction. I would like to call attention to some of the methods of so-called obstruction that have been adopted by gentlemen on this side. For instance, on Thurs-

day, April 24th, when this Bill was up for consideration in Committee for the first time, the members on this side endeavoured to obtain some information from the Minister of Railways, and spent two full hours in the effort to do so. Can hon. gentlemen opposite accuse us of obstruction under such circumstances? The Minister of Railways absolutely refused to give us the information we demanded from him, and which we had a right to receive. And after two long hours of debate, the information was vouchsafed; and what did it amount to? The Minister of Railways was trying to withhold from us, at least he pretended that he did not know, what salary was being paid to the man who was managing the Canadian Northern railway-the trifling sum of $25,000 was not worth noticing in the estimation of the Minister of Railways -and yet this is the man to whom we intend to trust the management of the railroad system of this country under the present Bill. Then, Sir, coming to the following day, Friday, April 25th, we spent nine weary hours endeavouring to extract further information from the Government in regard to this Bill. The Acting Minister of Justice (Mr. Meighen) was leading the House on that occasion, and we endeavoured to elicit from him details respecting the right of way of the forty-four railway lines that, according to him, the Government intended to commence operations on immediately. The minister refused to give us that information, or any information whatever, as to the location of these roads, and finally, when he rose to reply to gentlemen on this side, he sneered at the idea of the House wanting information of such a character. Now, if the Government is going to start the construction of these railroads in a few weeks, it should at least have the location of the railroads in question fixed. Yet the hon. gentleman sneered at the request for information in that regard-it was a trifling thing in his opinion for the people of this country to know where these forty-four railroads were to be located. These are examples of the kind of obstruction that the House has been subjected to, and because of which the Government, forsooth, considered it absolutely necessary to introduce the closure and shut off further discussion of the terms of this Bill. I repeat that we are not opposing the Bill on its public ownership provision, but purely and simply because we wish to see proper arrangements made for the management of this gigantic proposition. The member for Red Deer (Mr. Clark) this afternoon made a

very sane and sensible remark, in which 1 heartily concur, viz.: that if we are going to frame the Bill along proper lines we should see that provision is made for having the right men placed on the management of this great public undertaking. I agree most heartily with the hon. gentleman. But, Sir, do you consider that the man who has been a failure already in connection with the operations of the Canadian Northern, and who has been losing money already in the management of our railroads-do you consider men of that type capable of managing the affairs of this great railroad system successfully? For my part, I object to it, and decline to support any proposition of the kind. A man who has already proved himself beyond doubt a failure, a man who has already lost money in railroad operations, a man who has run the Canadian Northern Railroad system to the ground, as shown by the figures quoted in this House, has no right or title to be entrusted with the management of a great system such as this.
Now, it is contended that the criticism of the Opposition has not been of any advantage. I beg to call the attention of the House to one matter wherein we succeeded in inducing the Minister of Railways to amend this Bill, and that amendment, in the years to come if not now, will be of inestimable value to this country. I refer to the amendment of Section 23. In this section as originally drawn there was no reference to authorization by Parliament of the necessary expenditure for the construction and operation of railway lines and extensions by the directorate. As a result of our criticism the Minister of Railways found it convenient to amend the section by the insertion of the following words:
in respect to the construction whereof respectively, Parliament may hereafter authorize the necessary expenditure, or the guarantee of an issue of the Company's securities.
That is an important addition to the Bill and is quite a safeguard of the country's interests. Yet we are told that the criticism by hon. members on this side of the House has been of an obstructive nature.
I insist that it has been entirely in the opposite direction; it has been of a constructive nature and has greatly improved the Bill. We are told that we should fall down and worship this measure because it has been proposed by the Government and should instantly accept all its provisions without demur. But, as I have already stated, there is room for an honest difference of opinion on the question of public or
private ownership, and I submit that the evidence on the subject of public management is not of the rosiest nature. Take for instance, the Intercolonial railway, which from its inception has been under Government control; has it been an unqualified success? Take the Canadian Northern railway under its present management; has- it been an unqualified success? Take the telegraph and telephone systems under public management; have they been an unqualified success? I was privileged to look into a statement on that subject recently, and I find that the operating cost of our government telephones and telegraphs is in the neighbourhood of $800,000 per year, while the entire revenue is only $200,000 per year, an annual loss of $600,000. I understand, too, that the minister in charge of that department has received a report from an expert appointed to investigate the possibilities of the telephone system to the effect that he can abandon and give away enough of those lines to make a saving of- between $300,000 and $400,000 a year, and still give as good a service to the public.	-
We have heard a good deal in this House of the success of the Australian National Railway system. In to-day's issue of the Montreal Gazette I find a statement which, with your permission, Sir, I would like to place upon Hansard, because it is of particular value at the present time:
Australian Railways.
Direct Losses More Than $11,400,000 Yearly: (Boston Commercial.)
The report of the Railway Commissioners of Australia for the year ending June 30, 1918, has lately been issued. The report shows that the losses amount to more than $11,000,000 for last year and $11,500,000 for the year 1917, The Commonwealth transcontinental line, which was opened for traffic in October, 1917, has, therefore about eight months of operation. The loss on this line and the other short lines own by the Commonwealth, amounted to $2,280,000. The length of the transcontinental line is 1,051 miles and the cost has been $33,000,000 so far, hut it will require an expenditure of several millions more to put the road in fair shape.
I wish the House to mark this particularly, because it is a very important point in connection with Government operation. Notwithstanding the large loss sustained by the Commonwealth in the last three years of operation there is a further loss on taxation, which is as follows:
Thus, in round numbers, the losses in 1915-16 were $8,000,000 ; in 1916-17 they were $11,500,0100, and in the last year they were $11,000,000. These losses do not take into account any displacement of taxes.

Up to June 30, 1918, these railways had cost a little over one billion dollars and there were 20,259 miles.
If we reckon the tax loss at $600 per mile and we tax the railways in this country $622 per mile per year, this loss would amount to $12,000,000 a year.
But more important still is the fact of high freight rates on all the Australian lines. They are nearly three times as high as in this country, taking the year 1915 as an example. Last year, the people of Australia paid $65,000,000 for their freight bill. In 1917 rates in Australia were increased by 10 per cent, but most of them were fixed at 5 per cent increase the following year.
These facts, from the official reports of the Government itself, show: Direct losses of $8,000,000 to $11,000,000 a year, loss of taxes and on high freight rates total $40,000,000 a year, or a total loss of some $50,000,000 annually, and on top of this wages averaging 30 to 40 per cent less than in this country for the railroad employees.
This is a mighty burden upon the taxpayers of Australia. The socialized telegraph and telephone lines lose $800,000 a year and there are large losses on nearly every other socialistic scheme that those states have plunged into. It is feared that the people have created a pauper state, and at, any rate they have created the largest public debts in all the world.
Now, I do not wish that tins country, the land of my adoption, should emulate the policy of the Commonwealth of Australia. There are some things we do not wish to excel in, and one in particular is the incurring of debt. I have much pleasure, therefore, Sir, in supporting the amendment of the hon. member (Mr. Fielding.)

amendment of the hon. member for Shelburne and Queens. His address was convincing, cogent and logical; it must, have appealed to the good sense of this House. Section 16, if adopted in its present form, would introduce legislation of a revolutionary character, and it behooves all true Liberals to see to it that the necessary protest is made before it passes into law. When this question was originally before the House, the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) said that he could not see very much objection to the theory propounded by the member for Shelburne and Queens, but that at the moment without giving it due consideration he thought impracticable. I submit that neither he nor any of his colleagues have presented any argument to justify us on this side of the House in adopting his conclusions. The House of Commons should have full control of the funds of the country, and if this Bill is passed you abrogate one of the most important functions of Parliament.

I listened with interest to the remarks of the member for Red Deer (Mr. Michael Clark) this afternoon, in fact, whenever he rises I listen with attention and respect, because every one in the House will, I am sure, agree that whether he adopts the views of one side or of the other-he has adopted both on various occasions-'whatever he says is worth listening 9 p.m. to. I admire his diction and his style; he is one of the most finished orators in Parliament, and is an ornament to this House. Sometimes, in my leisure moments, I read the speeches of the hon. gentleman, for information and instruction. I have a distinct recollection of a speech he delivered on April 12, 1918, on this very question, which came before the House on the following motion of the Minister of Railways (Hon. J. D. Reid):
Resolved1, That it is expedient to provide that the working expenses of the *Canadian Government railways and of any railway under the change, management or direction of the Minister of Railways and Canals shall be paid out of the receipts and revenues of the said railway, and in the event of a deficit occurring at any time during any fiscal year the amount of such deficit shall toe payable out of ainy unappropriated moneys in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada, the said deficit to toe voted by Parliament at its first session following the close of sudh fiscal year.
The member for Red Deer spoke with his usual eloquence on that occasion. He said, as reported on page 692, Volume 1, Hansard, 1918:
I trust these railways will toe so managed, and I have sufficient -belief in the future of Canada to think that If they are well managed they will not show deficits, hut whether there are deficits or surpluses the principles of sound finance demand that the statements1 in regard to them should toe placed before Parliament in an annual financial statement I very well remember listening to speeches, as well as reading all the speeches he made during my lifetime, of that great master of finance Mr. Gladstone. There was nothing he insisted on more than that the expenditures and the incomes of a country should toe presented to Parliament each year and be debated by Parliament each year. If that is a sound principle- and in every constitutionally-governed country in the British Empire the principle is one of parliamentary practice-then this is a departure from the universal parliamentary practice of all the constitutionally-governed countries to the British Empire, including the Old, Country herself. Before the point was raised by the hon. member (Mr. Fielding) the analogy between the Post Office and the railways occurred to my own mind, and I must say the Acting Minister of Finance was very unsuccessful from my point of view in showing the analogy was not perfect. I think all he said upon the point was really making a distinction without a difference. The analogy to my mind was as perfect as one could find. What was the -analogy? The post offices form a department of

the public service. In so far as the 'government-owned railways are concerned, they constitute a department of the public service. The analogy to that extent is surely perfect They are both departments of the public service which one might call ""carrying departments."" In the one case they carry letters, and in the other case they oairry goods and persons. You might compare the various stations on your railroad to the various post offices. You might compare your station-masters to your postmasters. You have public expenditure in each case, and you have public incomes in each case. The analogy is absolutely perfect from Alpha to Omega.
I cite this as the view of the hon. member for Red Deer twelve months ago;-you have heard what he said on the same question to-day when it is again brought up by the member for Shelburne and Queens. What has caused this change of attitude in suoh a short time? Is it that his association with the Union Government has caused deterioration of his mind? I should be very sorry to think so, because for some time the hon. gentleman has been flirting with us on this side of the House. I only hope that when he does come back he will be mentally in as good a condition as he was when we turned him over to the pre sent Government.

to make a few remarks before this debate closes. I am particularly anxious to state my views, considering that the second reading of this Bill has been secured solely through the use of the gag; and to say where we stand on this side of the House as regards public ownership of our railways and other great services of public utility.
For many years past, this country lias made several att-emps in that direction, but without avail. For nearly forty years, we have managed the Intercolonial railway, covering some 1,800 miles in length, and I don't think that there can be found many statements issued by the management of that road and by the Minister of Railways up to now, showing surpluses. And yet the present Government had placed the management of that road in the hands of experienced men, to whom they were paying very large salaries, men who were borrowed from the Canadian Pacific Company and who had put into practice the ways and means in force on that system; however each year there are tremendous deficits on the Intercolonial railway. This shoVs clearly that it is impossible to get any return, out of the great public services, under political management.
13G
But, Mr. Speaker, when you read carefully clause 16, which it is proposed to amend today, I think that even the mover of that clause had a doubt in his mind as to the possibility for the country to get any returns from that new road (Canadian Northern) or from any of the subsidiary companies.
As a matter of fact, if you study closely that clause, which includes some fifteen lines, you notice that it refers almost entirely to deficits and to the way such deficits should be met. In the last three or four lines, it is provided that should there be a surplus, it can be disposed of without- the consent of Parliament. Therefore, is it not equivalent to an admission on the part of the Government, that they do not expect any surplus nor that the company, created by this Bill to administer the railways of this country, is likely to give any profits in the near future?
If there he any doubt that the present managers-and these managers will in all likelihood be retained-are unable to show a profit in their present undertakings, while we have before our eyes the example of what has happened in the past; that with vast subsidies being voted every year, the Government or the managers appointed by the Government were not able to gain any financial success, then there was certainly good reason for including the following proviso in section 16: ""if any profits should accrue then the said profits are to be administered in such and such a rway;"" which amounts to this: they could be thrown back into the mill again to emerge in the form of a deficit.
But, Sir, this section, along with the others, allows the Government, allows the directors to take over the monies of the various companies and use them as they see fit. No doubt, we members of Parliament sent here by the people to look after their interests, have something to say on this matter.
I believe the country would be very anxious to know just what percentage of shares we have in the capital stock of the subsidiary companies mentioned in the schedule attached to this Bill.
My own opinion, and I believe that I am at one in this with several hon. members on this side of the House, is that our interest in several of these companies is decidedly small, although sufficient to give us control. In several of them we have, I believe, merely 51 per cent or 55 per cent of the stock. Else, how comes it that, since we have taken over the Canadian 'Northern and its subsidiary companies the Govern-

ment has granted to .some of these subsidiary companies the subsidies set forth in the report of the Minister of .Railways for the current year? It is self-evident that if the present Government has seen fit to grant over three hundred thousand dollars to the Canadian Northern Pacific Railway, one of the subsidiary companies mentioned in the present schedule, we do not own all the capital stock of this company; hence we shall be forced to find the money necessary to make a success of the.se different companies. Where are the men who are going to come along and offer us the 40 per cent or 45 per cent of the stock that is out of our hands and that will be drawing dividends. Are they not the .same men who sold us the capital stock of the present company and who were not in a position to deliver the capital stock of the various subsidiary companies?
In the presence of these facts we have the right to be sceptical and to wonder whether public ownership of these railways will be . succesful.
_ We evidently have the right to feel dubious in this regard and we on this side of the House are really very, very doubtful.
But we own the railway^, say some hon. members on the other side; we own the capital stock of the railway companies; the Acting Prime Minister himself tells us: ""We own the capital stock but we do not own the real .estate."" Why? .Because this real estate is in the hands of the same notorious speculators who sold us this worthless .stock, and who to-day are waiting for us to revive it at the public's expense, so that they may get back the value of the railway bonds they never parted with.
Even, before Confederation, under the Union-.an administration that worked untold harm to the country-the foremost orators and the most ardent patriots of the day fought for the establishment of the Budget system so as to bring all expenditure under the control of Parliament. The fight was a hard one. Some members of Parliament, a .few ministers even, had to resign their seats in the Assembly, and it was only after years of struggle that Parliament finally obtained control of all expenditures drawn .from the Public Treasury.
Now, this very day, by accepting section 16 which has been brought down to the House, we will go back to those frightful days of 4840 and 1845 when the country was governed by an exclusive clique, a sort of family compact.
However, I am not surprised to find this clause here. Last session we witnessed a [Mr. DtVhf'no. I
similar attempt to withdraw several hundred million dollars from the control of Parliament. Do you remember, Mr. Speaker, a certain resolution presented by the hon. Minister of Railways whereby he asked the House to authorize the spending of some '$50,000,000 for the purchase of railway material not only for the Government railways but for those railroads also which were financially unable to help themselves, and not for one year alone but for the duration of the war? Thanks to the opposition of members on this side of the House the resolution remained on the Order Paper until the last days of the session, when the hon. Minister of Railways, realizing that he would never succeed in getting it passed, withdrew it himself.
Well, Mr. .Speaker, the same attempt is being made, this year, in a more concrete form. As the hon. minister has not succeeded in the course of last session, he is trying again, this year, in a way which is far more grievous and more dangerous to the country, by entrusting to the care of his officials the management of an important .part of the people's money. Therefore, I think we are now doing away with the principle which should guide all legislation, whether federal or provincial, that is the control by Parliament of all the monies spent in behalf of the country. After so many battles fought for the control of those monies, especialy in Nova Scotia previous to Confederation, I am in no way surprised at the hon. member for Shelburne and Queen (Mr. Fielding) proposing to-day an amendment to do away with such abuse. He is merely yielding, here, to the experience which he has acquired when he was himself Minister of Finance and when he saw, in his youth, the public men of his province fighting to obtain a right which we are now about to be deprived of. Those are the reasons why I shall gladly vote in favour of the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Queen's and Shelburne.

I am now making this floint: That the law as proposed to be put into effect by the hon. member would be impracticable of execution. There would have to be machinery provided for carrying it into effect, and because the machinery is absent, the hon. gentleman cannot expect the House to accept the amendment. Presuming that there was only one organization which represented all the employees of the road, what should be done with the amendment ?-and now we come to the principle of the amendment. If the principle is to be adopted, it means this: That the Government which has to appoint this directorate, and be responsible for its appointment, which has to be responsible in general for the management of the road after the appointment, is'to have no say in the appointment of two of the directors. If that is the case, why should it have any say in the appointment of any? If the Government is to be responsible for the conduct of men in the selection of whom it has no voice at all, and if that applies to two of the directorate, why should it not apply to all? Why is the Government to be held responsible for the conduct of large operations by men whom it does not choose? If, in a word, the principle of Government responsibility is to stand, how can the amendment carry?
In the next place, if the amendment were to carry, it would be an admission on the part of this Parliament that while we represent, as the Parliament of Canada to which the Government is responsible, one section of the people of this country, and therefore can nominate men to represent that section on the directorate, we do not represent another section, namely, the labour element. Is Parliament prepared to take that position? Is Parliament prepared to declare that we the representatives of the people hold an altogether different renvtr. Meigben.]
lationship to the proprietary interests of Canada, as opposed to the labour interests of Canada? This Parliament, if it is a Parliament at all, represents labour in the very same sense that it represents proprietorship or capital, and must take the responsibility, in appointing members of a directorate of a great Government railway system, of seeing to it that all major sections of the community of Canada are fairly represented on that directorate so far as may be necessary for the efficient management of the system. No one who understands the English language, or who knows the attitude of the Government, would, for one moment, suggest that the Government is opposed to the appointment on this directorate of men who have peculiar knowledge of the interests of those employed upon the road. It would seem to me obvious that, other things equal, it would be of great advantage to the system that there should be on the directorate men intimate with the needs of the employees of the road and peculiarly qualified to speak for them. That is one thing, but to say that these men must be selected finally, not by the Government which is responsible for the success of the undertaking but by others who have no such responsibility, is to affirm a principle that this Parliament has never before affirmed and one which I really cannot suppose that the hon. member for Ka-mouraska is serious in asking us to affirm. If we were to do so, if we were to take the ground-let me repeat it in another form of words-that Parliament, or the Government, is not qualified to select in the name of labour in the same way that it selects in the name of other classes of the community, either upon the basis of language, religion, occupation or in whatever manner, then we must also assume that we are not able to select in the name of any other section of the community and any other section would be in just the same position to come to Parliament and say: What right have you to select representatives on the Board of the National Railways who are peculiarly conversant with our interests in the management of these roads, or what right have you to select them if you permit one section of the community to select its own? Were the amendment to be adopted, Parliament would be landed in an anomalous and impossible position, in a position inconsistent with the best principles of constitutional government, in a position that no parliament in a constitutionally governed country has ever before occupied.

CARVELL (Minister of Public Works):,Minister of Public Works,'2122 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, before the vote is taken I feel it is incumbent upon me to say a word or two in as much as I am one of the ministers representing that portion of Canada traversed by the Intercolonial railway. This matter came up some months ago when the operation of the Intercolonial was transferred to the Canadian National railways by Order in Council, and it was done with my full knowledge and consent. I purpose to vote against the amendment of my hon. friend from Westmorland (Mr. Copp) and I shall do so not only with a clear conscience but with the feeling that the adoption of this amendment would really be going back to the old principle of operation of the Intercolonial as we had it in the past as long as I can remember.
There has been a great deal of discussion on this Bill regarding the virtues of public and private ownership, but for the life of me I fail to see wherein it was necessary to discuss the question at all. We have got the railways on our hands to-day-it is not a very rosy prospect I must confess-and it is the duty of Parliament and of the Government especially to try and see that they work out the problem in the best way possible. I repeat that I fail to see how the question whether or not a man is in favour of public ownership or of private ownership of a public utility is raised in connection with the Bill now before the House We have the Canadian National Railway system on our hands, we have the Canadian Northern, we have the Grand Trunk Pacific, we have

the National Transcontinental, we have the Intercolonial; and it is the duty of the Government and of Parliament to devise the best possible method of making the operation of these roads a success. I am not going to hark back to what has taken place in connection with the operation and management of the Intercolonial Railway from its inception. It has been a political machine, pure and simple, and any man who stands up in this House and says that it has not been a political machine up to the last two years or so-well, he is simply talking to hear himself talk. If I thought that the Canadian National Railway system was going to be run as a political machine, as Government railways have been run in the past, I would vote and fight against the whole thing; I do not know what I would not do to prevent its going through. We have not received the service in the Maritime Provinces to which we have been entitled; and it has cost fifty per cent more money to give us the service we did get than it should have cost. In this respect one party has been just as bad as the other. Now, instead of fifteen or eighteen hundred miles of railway, as we had in the Intercolonial, we have about twelve thousand miles-and it looks as if we should have considerably over twenty thousand miles before very long. I tell you, Sir, that unless this system is run as a business proposition, Canada will be faced with a most serious problem; with something more serious even than the debt incurred by the war. Much, therefore, as I would like to see advantages given' to my own part of Canada; much as I would like to see the Intercolonial Railway run for the benefit of the Maritime Provinces, I cannot as a public man agree to any proposal which will cause this or any other portion of the system to be operated as anything but a business proposition. The operation of these Government railways may not be perfect, but it will be under the control of a board of directors entirely independent of the Government, except that they are appointed by the Government. If ever a body of men had absolutely a free hand in the running of a railway, the board administering the Canadian National Railways have had a free hand up to the present time-I know what I am talking about. I can promise that so long as I -remain in this Government there will be no question, so far as I know, about their having a free hand to run the National Railway system as a business proposition. Unless we do run

it that way, we might as well throw up our hands and say that the whole thing is a hopeless mess. But I believe that it can be done; and because we want to run the whole thing as a business proposition 1 want to see the Intercolonial railway put in with the rest of it. The Minister of Bail-ways has pointed out the impossibility of operating the Canadian National Eailways down to Montreal and stopping there, not going on to Halifax and St. John. It is not in the interest of the Maritime Provinces that that should be done. The Government railways can be operated much more economically and in a much more businesslike manner if taken as a whole than they could if part of the system is run by the Canadian National Bailway Company and part by the Minister of Eailways.
I said in beginning that I did not intend to say very much, but I would not feel like giving a silent vote on a matter of such great importance to the Maritime Provinces. I believe that by incorporating practically the whole system of railways in the Maritime Provinces into this railway system, we are doing the Maritime Provinces the greatest possible benefit. If the operation of the national railways goes on as it has gone on during the last year and as I believe it will go in the future, it will not be many years before the people who now oppose this proposal will stand up to bless it and to say that the elimination of politics from the administration of the Government railways and the operation of those railways as a business proposition means the accomplishing of a great work for the people of Canada as a whole.
My hon. friend referred to freight rates. There may be some dislocation of freight rates; there may be cases in which we shall have to pay a little higher freight rates in the future than we have paid in the past. But there will also be cases where we shall get an efficient service, which we have been unable to get in the past. The member for Westmorland (Mr. Copp) knows the trouble he had in his own county in an effort to get service under political management.

By linking up the various roads we can operate them in the most economical manner. We have now the Transcontinental between Winnipeg and Moncton divided up in this way: the management at Winnipeg that operate part of the western lines control as far east as Cochrane; then we have the other part under the management at Montreal and that management has control of the Intercolonial. Now we have linked them together under the same management and the same staff in order to save operating expenses. When it comes to quoting freight rates, the tariff man in charge of the Canadian National Railway system must be able to figure out rates from the West clear through to the Atlantic ports. If you have this as part of one co-ordinated system, is it not fair to say that those who are operating the road to make it a success will want to route all the business they can by their own system? My idea, when the Intercolonial Railway was linked up with the Canadian National Railway system, was that it would throw so much, more business down through the Lower Provinces that it would make the Intercolonial pay where it has not paid in the past. The whole trouble with the Intercolonial Railway was that it started at Sydney and ran to Montreal, but the other railways had no interest in giving it traffic, and consequently it was hard work to make it pay. Now that it is part of our national
system all the traffic from the West that can be sent over the Intercolonial to Halifax, 'St. John and Sydney will be so routed.
I cannot for the life of me see why the hon. member can suggest that the Intercolonial should be kept out of the Canadian National Railway system.
Although our national system is under a company incorporated by this Bill, still it is all subject to the control of Parliament, and if the operation is not carried on successfully, hon. members can discuss the system just the same as they were accustomed to discuss the Intercolonial in the past.
The hon. member (Mr. Copp) has emphasized the idea that the employees of the Intercolonial are not in a position to receive the advancement now that they would have received had it not been incorporated in the national system. So far as my information goes, the employees of the Intercolonial are better satisfied that it is part of the Transcontinental, for the reason that a young man starting on the Intercolonial to-day has hundreds of opportunities of getting a position on our system of fifteen thousand miles as compared with the meagre opportunities open to him on the Intercolonial alone.
In my opinion one of the reasons why the hon. member objects to the change is this. We have heard him, so long as he has been a member of this Parliament, complaining day after day bitterly of the patronage in connection with the Intercolonial Railway. He knows well enough that when it goes into this system that ends any opportunity he has of dominating the patronage. The Board of Directors are going to operate this system independent of any members of Parliament or even of members of the Government. That is where the trouble is with the hon. member; there is no doubt about that.

MACLEAN:,Minister Without Portfolio,WEIGHTS AND MEASURES ACT AMENDMENT.,,,"I had intended, when last on my feet, to state that legislation similar to this has been enacted in other countries, particularly in the United States. The states of Massachusetts and Wisconsin have enacted a law of this kind, and I think that New South Wales has likewise passed legislation on similar lines. All this indicates that in the experience of other countries it was found impossible to secure convictions without these special enactments. My hon. friend (Mr. Pedlow) appears to be apprehensive that the merchants will be harrassed by the officers of the department in the enforcement of this law. I think I can safely assure him that there will never be any attempt to punish the casual violator of the Act, because there has always been what is known technically as "" a toleration of error "" allowed in any cases which come under the observation of the officers. For example, the toleration of error is applied to scales tq insure protection to the man who owns and uses those scales. I think the Committee may feel quite sure that the department will not institute prosecutions for what would appear to be casual offences or mistakes, or some infinitesimal shortage in weight. The principle upon which this legislation is based is that a man is entitled to get the thing for which he pays, and if he does not, it is no justification that the employer has careless or dishonest officials. I can see the merit in my hon. friend's contention that there may be unintentional short weight delivered, and in some cases overweight. At the same time the delivery of short weight is becoming, or rather, it has become, quite common, and there ought to be some means of dealing with it arid giving publicity to the fact, as against some of the offenders. After all, it is in the interest of the business man or dealer, who is scrupulously careful about giving the proper weight to his customers, that some other dealer, through carelessness on his part, or on the part of his employees, should not profit to his disadvantage.

I think the hon. member is very much mistaken when he says that the cans are sometimes short in weight from four to six ounces. Speaking for the Dominion Can-ners, while we may have had complaints as to quality, we have had none as to quantity. All our cans of corn and peas are filled by machinery at the rate of from 70 to 100 cans a minute. At this rate, it is possible for an occasional can to be not quite as full as others, but generally they are all full. A shortage in weight is more likely to occur in canning fruits which are filled by hand. For corn, peas and tomatoes we^ use the standard can used, same as used in the United States. We could not get help enough to fill these cans by hand and keep up our output. I have never heard of anything relating to short weight except perhaps with regard to fruits. We buy a great deal of produce, and we used to have trouble over raspberries and strawberries, but now all our produce is bought by weight. In my opinion ' this Bill is along the right lines.

of the principle of this clause. I do not think the argument that merchants will be penalized for the acts of their clerks is well founded, because if a clerk habitually gives short weight or short measure the customers will soon bring it to the attention of the proprietor, and it will then be his duty to discharge the clerk. I think it is the proprietor who should be penalized The tendency of the trade is to deal more and more in package goods. The retail merchants buy a quantity of package goods which frequently happen to be short weight. The minister referred a moment ago to packages of sugar, and I suppose he meant packages that were put up by the factories and marked, as is usual, 20 pounds. In such a case the manufacturer should suffer and not the merchant, who can hardly be expected to weigh every one of the packages and cull out those of short weight. Packages frequently come short in weight, and I think the onus should be on the manufacturer or the packer, and not on the merchant. There was a penalty imposed on merchants who sold impure maple sugar. I know of merchants who were fined for selling impure maple sugar although it was stamped ""pure."" They did not know that it was not pure, and simply sold it over the counter for what it purported to be. I think the Bill should be so amended as to penalize the manufacturer and not the merchant in the case of package goods.

That is going entirely too far. The minister has taken into his head the notion that it is proper to make criminal laws for all matters of this kiiid, and if in any of the ordinary transactions of life, a man is to be held criminally liable, if he happens to make a slip, that is breaking every principle I have ever known of in this country.

All that needs to be done to constitute an offence under the clause as it stands now is-we will take a single case -that a man by registering, or otherwise, represents that a woman to whom he is not married is his wife.
Now, all that has to be done is to so represent that a woman to whom he is not married is his wife; that itself the statute declares to be an offence. Consequently in my judgment-which I do not put forward as final by any means-unless we add "" knowing the same to be untrue,"" this knowledge does not require to be brought home to the accused person.

So far as the point raised by the hon. member for Qu'Appelle is concerned, 1 would certainly be of the opinion without reserve, that if the law were to be amended merely as asked for by the hon. member for' Grey, then the guilty knowledge would require to be brought home to the accused by the prosecution, lit occurs to me- although I would like more time over these matters before discussing them that it would be better to state that the onus of proof of lack of knowledge should be on the-accused.

I think the Committee and the House and the country would like to know how t'he moneys derived from the different loans have been expended in con-
,
nection with the war, and how we stand generally in respect of our war and other expenditures. Possibly the minister intends to give us that information now, but I rather thought he told- us not very long ago that he did not intend to divide his Budget Speech into two sections. For that reason I really think the consideration of this Bill should not be taken up until after the Budget Speech has been delivered. If the minister intends to go on with the Bill now, I trust that he will give the Committee the fullest possible explanation of our expenditure, particularly in respect of the war, the proceeds of the different loans, and what he proposes to do with the moneys which he will obtain under this Bill. It is quite true the minister may have been giving an explanation of these matters from time to time, but we have been so intent on winning the war that, speaking for myself, and I suppose that in this I am like the average Canadian citizen, I do not remember the details. Now that 'the war is over, I think it would be well to have a thorough reckoning of our borrowings and expenditures in connection with the war.

Now, my hon. friend from Kingston seems to think that there is something unfair to the people living in these irregular relationships in this respect: That if they are living in a private house the law does not recognize their relationship as a crime, but if they go to an hotel or boarding-house and register there it is a crime. There is a distinction to be drawn. While these people are living in their own house they are not brought into contact with other persons so nearly and so intimately as they are if they register in an hotel or in a boarding-house.

Hon. NEWTON W. ROWELL (President of the Council): On Friday last I promised that the Government would give to the House information in reference to the terms of the Peace Treaty so soon as that information was available for publication. A summary of the Peace Treaty, consisting of some ten thousand words, was received by the Government this morning with the proviso that it might be released for publication at one o'clock to-day, and a despatch to that effect was also received from the Colonial Office. Subsequently, a despatch came from the censor stating that it should not be released to the press until to-morrow morning, but as the Government learned that it had already been published this morning in a special edition of a Montreal paper, as a cable from the London Times, and as the summary was being released to the American press at one o'clock to-day, the Government decided, as a matter of fairness to the Canadian press, to release the summary to the press at the same hour. It has therefore gone out to the press of Canada.
The House will be interested to hear a few of the most important provisions of this momentous document, which is made between the twenty-seven Allied and associated powers of the one part and Germany of the other.
The treaty does not deal with questions affecting Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey, except in so far as binding Germany to accept any agreement reached with those former Allies.
Following the preamble and deposition of powers comes the covenant of the League of Nations as the first section of the treaty. The frontiers of Germany in Europe are defined in the second section; European political classes given in the third; and

extra European political classes in the fourth.
Next are the military, naval, and air terms as the fifth section, followed by a section on prisoners of war and military graves, and a seventh on responsibilities.
Reparations, financial terms, and economic terms are covered in sections eight to ten.
Then comes the aeronautic section, ports, waterways and railways section, the Labour covenant, the section on guarantees, and the final clauses.
Germany, by the terms of the treaty, restores Alsace-Lorraine to France, accepts the internationalization of the Saar Basin temporarily and of Danzig permanently; agrees to territorial changes towards Belgium and Denmark and in East Prussia, cedes most of Upper Silesia to Poland, and renounces all territorial and political rights outside Europe, as to her own or her Allies' territories, and especially to Morocco, Egypt, Siam, Liberia, and Shantung.
She also recognizes the total independence of German-Austria, Czecho-Slovakja, and Poland.
Her army is reduced to 100,000 men, including officers.
Conscription within her territory is abolished	-
All forts 50 kilometers east of the Rhine are to be razed; and all importation, exportation, and nearly all production of war materials stopped.
Allied occupation of parts of Germany will continue till reparation is made, but will be reduced at the end of each of three five-year periods if Germany is fulfilling her obligations.
Any violation by Germany of the conditions as to the zone 50 kilometers east of the Rhine will be regarded as an act of war.
The German navy is reduced to six battleships, six light cruisers, and 12 torpedo boats, without submarines, and a personnel of not over 15,000.
All other vessels must be surrendered or destroyed.
Germany is forbidden to build forts controlling the Baltic, must demolish Heligoland, open the Kiel canal to all nations, and surrender her 14 submarine cables.
She may have no military or naval air forces, except 100 unarmed seaplanes until October 1 to detect mines, and may manufacture no aviation material for a six months' period.
She agrees to return to the 1914 most favoured nation tariffs without discrimination
137i	|	|	:
of any sort, to allow Allied and associated nationals freedom of transit through her territories and to accept highly detailed provisions as to pre-war debts, unfair competition, internationalizations of roads and rivers, and other economic and financial clauses.
She also agrees to the trial of the ex-Kaiser by an International High Court for a supreme offence against international morality, and of other nationals for violation of the laws and customs of war.
Holland is to be asked to extradite the former German Emperor and Germany being responsible for delivering the latter.
The League of Nations is accepted by the Allied and associated powers as operative and by Germany in principle but without membership.
Similarly an international labour body is brought into being with a permanent office and annual convention.
Germany accepts full responsibility for all damages caused to Allied and associated Governments and nationals. She agrees specifically to reimburse all civilian damages beginning with an initial payment ol 20,000,000,000 marks, subsequent payments to be secured by bonds to be issued at the discretion of the Reparation Commission.
Germany is to pay shipping damage on a ton-for-ton basis by cession of a large part of her merchant, coasting and. river fleets, and by new construction, and to devote her economic resources to the rebuilding of the devastated regions.
A great number of international bodies of different kinds and for different purposes are created, some under the League of Nations; some to execute the peace treaty. Among the former is the commission to govern the Saar Basin till a plebiscite is held fifteen years hence. A High Commissioner of Danzig, which is created into a free city under the League, and various commissions for plebiscites in Malmody, Schleswig and East Prussia. Among those to carry out the peace treaty are the Reparations, Military, Naval, Aviation, Financial and Economy Commissions ; the International High Court and Military Tribunals to fix responsibilities, and a series of bodies for the control of international rivers.
Certain problems are left for solution between the Allied and associated powers, notably details of the disposition of the German fleet and cables, the former German colonies, and the values paid in reparation.
Certain other problems, such as the laws of the air and the opium, arms and liquor",,,,

The officers of the department think that it will facilitate the administration of the Act and will be in the public interest as well. The only penalty now for short weight delivery is under the Criminal Code, and that is rather a harsh measure to invoke. The amount of short weight delivery in Canada -and I suppose it is true of all other countries-is very substantial indeed, and one would be surprised at the great number of ' complaints that are made to the officers of the Weights and Measures Branch in regard to it. But when the officers attempt to prosecute offenders for fraud they encounter very serious difficulties. For instance, the proprietor of a store from which short weight delivery has been made may know nothing about it; somebody in his employment may be responsible, or the business may be carelessly managed. Experience has led our officers to ask for this legislation, for they feel that if dealers are punished in this way it will be more easy to secure convictions, and the resulting publicity will act as a deterrent. New South Wales at the present time has the same law. I think Great Britain is adopting it this year. The section appealed to me as being a pretty good way of dealing with such offences Of course, whatever similar provisions are contained in the criminal law' will still prevail dealing with aggravated cases.

However, my hon. friend will realize that in criminal proceedings you must prove wilful intent, and if he reflects upon the matter he will realize that it is practically impossible to prove it; and that is the experience of all men engaged in administering laws of this nature. For instance, a few days ago an inspection of sugar in bags supposed to contain 24 pounds- revealed a shortage in a great number of the bags, although some were above the specified weight. Take it all in all there was nothing to indicate wilful intent on the part of the manufacturer or dealer; perhaps it was due to carelesness. That state of affairs can be corrected more readily, I think, by giving the department this power to fine such persons. The- officers of the department inform me that if they have this section available, a great many prosecutions will be undertaken and considerable publicity given to violations of the law. I think it is a provision that will work out all right in practice, and I should like at least to see it tried.

Mr. LOGGIE. Some commodities which are of certain weight when packed are subject to shrinkage, and the longer they are held on the shelves of the store the greater that shrinkage is.

not giving this point the consideration it deserves. As the hon. member for 'Huntingdon has pointed out certain commodities after being carefully weighed will shrink in weight, while others will increase; it depends upon the atmosphere in which the goods are kept. Textiles for instance, will shrink in weight in a dry atmosphere; and increase in weight in a damp atmosphere. If the minister does not accept my suggestion to insert the word "" knowingly "" in the first line, I think this clause will be a most dangerous one, and will subject the mercantile interests of this country to a great deal of annoyance. I am informed by legal gentlemen in the House that the
Criminal Code already covers the cases which this clause seeks to cover. It is impossible for any merchant to measure goods exactly at all times. How then can we possibly hold him accountable for the acts of his employees? The human element enters into the transaction; it is impossible to be always exact. If this clause passes in its present form, the proprietor of a store will be liable to be hauled before the magistrate and fined $25 because his clerk on one occasion happened to give short weight, not with any intention of defrauding, but simply because the human element entered into the transaction. Furthermore, it will cause a whole lot of trouble for the department.

Some twenty years ago I had in my employ a gentleman of high standing. A customer had been annoying him with frequent complaints of short weight, and he asked me what to do. I said:	Do you know that
you have made no mistake? He said: Absolutely. I said:	You weigh him out a
pound more sugar than he asks for the next time he comes, and give him thirteen lemons or bananas instead of a dozen. He did so, and there was no complaint. I said to him then: You may go to that customer and tell him that you have proof that he is not honest, because he has not reported the

extra pound of sugar or the fact that he was given thirteen instead of a dozen lemons or bananas. A man may come to a store and buy certain commodities, take them home, remove a portion of them and then call in an officer and complain that the weight or measure was short. Retail merchants have troubles enough to burden them; yet by this law you are putting them in the very clutches of dishonest people. I am also a lumberman. If I send a thousand feet of lumber out ten miles, it should be measured at the wagon; the customer should not report to me two weeks later that he did not get a thousand feet of lumber. We might as well close up business if such a law as this is on the statute-book.

He says that people coming to Canada can be married. That is quite true, but people

may not be in a position to marry. I will mention an instance that came to my attention within the last month. A Canadian went overseas leaving in Canada a wife who went off with another man. The soldier foolishly paid attention to a girl in England, and she, believing him to be single, married him, not finding out that he was a married man until a child was about to be born. She came to Canada with him but the child was born prior to their arrival. That woman is in Canada living with the man in Kingston, wife number one not desiring to live with him. It is not a legal offence for these'two people to live together, and you cannot prosecute the man for bigamy because the offence was committed in England. Will it be contended that it should be an offence for this man and woman to register in a hotel as man and wife, notwithstanding the fact that they may legally live together in a private house? That would be an anomaly. I can give half a dozen instances of the same kind if necessary. I have no desire to throw protection around people of this class but I certainly think that we owe it to them not to set traps for them. That is the principle on which I advocate the amendment I propose. The endeavour apparently is to prevent a man and woman from going to a hotel and using it as a place of assignation, but it should not be held that a couple casually visiting a hotel should be treated as criminals simply, because they register or otherwise conduct themselves as man and wife when they are not such in fact. There are men and women living in this country as married people who are not legally divorced from their previous husbands or wives. How unreasonable it would be to say that they should live together in private residences unmolested, but that because perchance they come !to Ottawa to see the leader of the Opposition or go to Toronto to attend the opening of the legislature they should be made criminals if they register at a hotel.

I do not know exactly what view they take, but I would be very much surprised if the Prime Minister of Nova Scotia and the other members of the Provincial Government would do anything that would' not be in harmony with the general law, and whatever is done is, I suppose, the finding of this Game Association, which collects those moneys, out of which they pay the game wardens in the different parts of the province.

Am I asking too much from the Minister of Finance ('Sir Thomias White) ? Am I obstructing in asking that? I believe not. He is asking us, in anticipation of the Budget, to vote $350,000,000, are we not entitled to know the policy of Canada for normal times as regards our land anid naval forces? Clause (c) reads:
Purposes-the promoting of trade and industry and transportation facilities therefor.
I agree with the statement just made by the hon. member for Pontiac (Mr. Cahill).
I am not enamoured with this Rumanian venture, especially when I see that Rumanian bonds are being marketed from bucket shop to bucket shop and passing through the hands of Sir Clifford Sifton, who, by the way, has opened an office in the building rented by the Canadian Trade Mission in London. The Government. I think, should have prevented any such desecration of Rumanian bonds. 'If my hon. friend in asking us to vote money for . the promoting of trade and industry and transportation facilities, therefor is sincere and earnest, as he ought to be, I am in accord with him; but again I say if in those times of peace to which we are looking forward there is one Cabinet minister who ought to be in his seat, it is the Minister of Trade and Commerce (Sir George Foster). During the last few years, we have been sadly missing the presence of a Minister of Trade and Commerce. Far be it from me to say one word against this right hon. gentleman (Sir George Foster), in whose ability I believe and for whose splendid eloquence I have the utmost admiration. He has, I believe, been one of the best public servants of Canada; he is one of the Nestors of this House; but I am repeating only what I read every day in the Unionist
press when I say that as Minister of Trade and Commerce he has been a gre*t failure. He has not taken to heart his position as Minister of Trade and Commerce, a department which has been sadly lacking in force, ability and foresight to develop the trade of Canada. Canadians are often called "" the lion's cubs."" That means, I suppose, that we are the true sons of John Bull, who is the master merchant of the world, who for centuries has been sailing and trading on the seven seais of the globe. Not to speak of our high tariff, which is a barrier 9 p.m. to. our commerce, we have done nothing to even imitate from afar what has been done by John Bull and Uncle Sam. Long before the armistice was signed-and my authority is the London Economist and some financial reviews in England and the United States-^-England and the United States had their trade agents in all parts of the world. Any western member will tell us that in the far Canadian West, representatives of American firms have been trading with our Canadian farmers long before our own Canadian manufacturers. I have seen that stated in the press and I have heard it from the lips of' my hont friends who represent western constituencies. Therefore, anything which will tend to promote our trade and industry, I shall willingly grant to my hon. friend, but what does he intend to do? Has he given this Committee any explanations? Is he going to establish agencies and in what parts of the world? Is he going to create new avenues of trade and commerce? He does not say. What will our new tariff be?
We are at the present moment building a- fleet of steamers. Some months ago I was present at the launching of the Canadian Voyageur in Montreal, in my own constituency, at Vickers, and on that occasion I heard speeches delivered by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries and some other prominent gentlemen from Montreal, and I read in the press that the Government had a very large programme of naval construction. But to my dismay, to my horror, I find that the ships we have been building in Canadian shipyards with Canadian material, are being used not for transportation facilities between Canadian and foreign ports, but by the wily Yankees between their ports and other foreign ports. This little item came to my hand the other day:
Barbados-Steamer Canadian Voyageur- Farr, J.-3,000 bags sugar.
That is the consignee.

St. {Lawrence Sugar Refining Co.-11,500 bags sugar.
Armstray, L. W. and P.-8,000 bags sugar.
This was carried from Barbados to New York. Now it is strange that our ships should not find any business for Canadian ports-Quebec, Montreal, Halifax, St. John, Three Rivers or even Toronto-in the exporting of Canadian produce. Have we built those steamers to send them to United States ports, to take on cargoes there for other foreign ports?

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 of the Criminal Code, any person who sells, delivers or causes to be sold or delivered anything by weight, measure or number short of the quantity ordered or purchased, shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding $25 for such first offence and $100 for any subsequent offence under this section.

An instance has been cited this afternoon of a number of bags of sugar having been weighed up and exposed for sale, the weights not all being uniform. As the human ' element is not as exact as some mechanical device for measuring, if some customer of a merchant purchased one of those bags and it happened to be short weight, that particular merchant would, under this measure, be liable to a penalty of $25. That is placing the merchant in a very unfair position, and it should not be the attitude of this Committee to place the mercantile community of the country in a position of this kind. I have many employees labouring for me distributing merchandise. How can I control all their actions? I employ the best help I can obtain, and I warn them 
to be careful in their actions as regards matters of this nature, but if they are careless, then I am not only held responsible, but subjected to the petty annoyance of being hauled up before a magistrate and exposed to the odium of being fined for their carelessness. They are not fined, but I am.

If a dealer has careless employees in his store and they grow accustomed to delivering short weight or short measure, that employer should suffer the penalty. Further, I do not think those in mercantile business will object to this see-
4 p.m. tion, because it is for the protection of the man who is careful and honest as well, in measuring or weighing the goods which he sells to his customers. My hon. friend would be surprised if he knew of the great quantities of goods delivered in this country which are actually short weight. It would be impossible to establish knowledge on the part of the principal, and it is not a difficult matter to deliver proper weights. The delivering of short weight or short measure is due to carelessness or dishonesty against both of which the public should be protected. If short weights were delivered by any merchant and that fact came to the attention of the officers of the department, the merchant would not be prosecuted for the first offence; he would be warned and consideration would be given to his reputation in the community, the character of his staff and so on. I quite agree with my hon. friend that the section might be abused, but I do not see how the public can be protected in any other way.
. Mr. JACOBS: I might come to the assistance of the minister by pointing out

that under the Liquor License law, the fact that liquor was sold is sufficient to justify a conviction, whether the owner knew of the matter or not.

When we remove the safeguards . provided by the common law and constitute a crime regardless of the state of mind of the individual, we are on very dangerous ground. We passed a law the other day whereby, if a lady put a pan of bread into the oven in too big a fire, and the bread should burn, she is liable to two years in the penitentiary. That is extraordinary, but it is the law to-day that if by negligence any person makes a fire which destroys property of any kind he is liable to be sent to the penitentiary. Now we are coming forward with another law by which, if a pound of tea is one-thousandth of an ounce short in weight a man may be fined 825, or, according to the amendment, $100 for a second offence. It is better to err on the side of mercy and fairness, and it is better that the responsi-

bility should be thrown on the Crown to prove wilful intent, than to make it easy to punish people. We should not neglect the time-honoured principle of the common law that there must be criminal	intent in	order	to render aperson criminally liable, and I fully agree with	the	hon. member who
insists that the word ""wilful"" should be inserted. If this word were added I would have no great fault to find. I do not think that the store-keeper could be criminally liable for a sale made by his clerk. He would be civilly liable in damages for the quality of the goods and for any shortage or inferiority. My view of the criminal law is that the master is not liable criminally unless there is criminal intent on his part. Of course, if he instructs his servant to do an illegal act he is responsible through his agent and is parti ceps criminis. I think the whole difficulty might be circumvented by adding the word ""wilful."" It is better that the department should experience some difficulty than that people should be fined and imprisoned who are not really criminally liable.

I said that adultery, at least in Ontario and Quebec, had never been recognized as a crime. The hon. member may be quite right in saying that it should be made a criminal offence, but if we are going to make it such let us do so in a direct way and not set traps for people. What I said was that so long as the law of Canada did not recognize adultery as a crime, I thought it was unreasonable that those who were living together openly as man and wife should be made criminals simply because they went to a hotel, lodging house, or boarding house and represented themselves as being married. I object to setting traps for people who are innocently-if I may use that word without giving offence to the hon. member for Frontenac-doing something they would have a right to do under the general law of the country but which becomes an offence when they register at a hotel or. boarding house, or represent themselves as having a certain status which they have not.

I am looking at the interpretation of this clause from a common sense standpoint, and there is a difference sometimes between legal interpretations and common sense. Suppose I were to introduce a Bill and it were to become law-(although there is not the slightest chance of that-penalizing a lawyer for advising a client that he has got a good case in court, whereas he has not a leg to stand on. It would be just as reasonable for me, if I were Minister of Justice, to press through a Bill of that kind as it is to pass legislation of the character contemplated here. What a storm there would be in the House if I were to attempt, as a legal adviser of the Government, to pass a Bill of that nature. It is all very well to say that the officers of the department will not be unduly exacting, but under this Bill, as I read i,t, it will be open to the individual- purchaser to institute proceedings. It does not state that it is necessary for an official of the department to prosecute. Any Tom, Dick or Harry who goes into a store and buys a package of merchandise is able to take action before the magistrate, and we all know how human are magistrates in administering justice. It all depends on the state of their liver. If they have been out late the night before and are feeling the effects, we all know what kind of a deal they are likely to hand out. As a matter of fact, I have known many magistrates decide cases before they heard the evidence.

that complaints are from time to time coming in to the department, and I have no doubt of that, but am sure, when the department investigates the basis of the complaints, it will find that in the majority of cases they are without foundation and fact, and that the actual cases of short weights and offences of that kind are infinitesimal. No business man could continue long in business if he habitually delivered short weights and measures. According to this legislation one would think that the mercantile people of this country were a crowd of thugs, robbers and criminals, and that a wall had to be built round the public for their protection, as if the public were not capable of protecting themselves. From my experience, I have no hesitation
5 p.m. in saying that should customers be given short weights or measures they very quickly go back to the store and demand their pound of flesh, and I do not think the minister is well advised in acting the part of Shylock in asking that this section pass. It may be not only the pound of flesh, but some of the heart's blood along with it, and it was the latter to which Portia objected so well. I move:-
That section 61A be amended by inserting the word "" knowingly "" after the word "" who "" in the first line.
The principle underlying this amendment is admitted by the minister; it covers the point of carelessness, which is all that this Committee should be concerned in. If a man deliberately, habitually, commits this offence, then he should be penalized, but as the section now reads, if the action is only casual, occurring once in a while, he is liable to a penalty.

subject, I would like to draw the minister's attention to a phase of military life which has been brought out in a letter received by me to-day from a soldier's father. Speaking in regard to his son, the writer says:
He enlisted at London, Ontario, in December 1915, went to England in January 1916, and to Prance in June 1916, and has been there on active service ever since, while his wife and child are with us. The Canadian Authorities in Division One, London, Ont., took the initiative in the signing up of the boys conducting their medical examination, etc. They advised them to enlist in the Imperial Mechanical Transport, as the C.E.F. at that time did not need any more recruits. They took their advice. Had my son signed up with the C.E.F., he on discharge would have been entitled to $100 per month for six months, a total of $600. Instead of that the B.E.F. will only grant $75 all told, a difference of $525.
Now since this Bill, as it is worded, refers purely to the demobilization of Canadian soldiers, I thought it would be an opportune time to ask the minister whether he intends in the expenditure of these moneys to provide to the extent of $525 for the war gratuity of a young Canadian soldier who is married and has a wife and child? If the minister intends to do nothing in that direction, will he make representations, if such may be proper, to the Imperial authorities to influence them to act equitably to this young man who was misled, according tQ my information, by the officers of the minister's department 'at London. On inquiry, I find that there are overseas many hundreds of Canadian young men who have gone to the front in some capacity or other, having either transferred to, or enlisted directly in this country in, the Imperial Forces. If the Imperial Government are doing nothing for these young men, I want the minister to tell me whether he intends to do anything for them, and whether this fund will be available for that purpose? If the minister replies in the negative, I would say that I would be rather ashamed to live in the country if such inequity should be passed out to these young men who fought for their King and country as Canadians
in the Imperial Army. I take this opportunity of asking the minister whether he has considered the matter, and if he has not done so, to state, if he can, that he will consider it and that he will look favourably upon the application which I am making on behalf of these men.
Major-General MEWBURN: The subject which the hon. member has raised has certainly been given a good deal of consideration, particularly of late. The war gratuity does not apply to such a man as the hon. gentleman has referred to, hut I may say that some little time ago suggestions and claims came from different soldiers regarding the war gratuity, a few of the class are Imperial army reservists, who, when the war began, left Canada and rejoined their units. The claim has been made that those men should participate in this war gratuity, or be paid the difference between what they received from the Imperial Government and what Canada is giving. There were also pensioners resident in Canada who returned to England and re-enlisted-I am speaking of British pensioners, on whose behalf application was made; likewise, men who especially enlisted in Canada in the British Army Service Corps and the Royal Engineers ; men who enlisted in Canada and the United States (British subjects), and Canadians who enlisted while overseas in the Imperial Forces.
I may say for the information of my hon. friend that a committee has been working on this for the last week, and while it is not a Committee of the House, I understand, unofficially, that several hon. members who have had those matters brought before them have been meeting and are drafting a memorandum, which I believe they are giving to the Government, and I know it includes such items as those. Whether the Government can see their way to concede those or some other items, I am not prepared to say. But there are a great many hardships. A great many Canadians I know joined the Imperials, and a'large number of university graduates went over to England and took commissions. I understand the Imperial Government are giving very much larger gratuities to officers than the Canadian Government, but not anything like what we are giving to the rank and file. But that matter is having our most serious consideration.

Now, Mr. Chairman, I think that under the circumstances, and having regard to what I have said, there should be a full and complete investigation into naval affairs in Canada during the last four years. Furthermore, I have no hesitation in saying that owing to the black eye which has been administered to the navy, it is too late now to endeavour to do anything to put naval affairs in Canada on a satisfactory basis. At the time of the Soudanese war, when the question of sending help
to Britain was discussed in this Parliament, Sir John A. Macdonald used the expression: "" Not a dollar, not a man."" I repeat that statement [DOT] now without any hesitation. I say in all seriousness that Canada should not spend one dollar on naval matters for the next few years at least. One reason is that our financial condition will not warrant it, and even if we wished to do so we could not vote sufficient money to build or to purchase naval boats which would be Of any service in time of trouble.
Because of its inefficiency, the Naval Department at Ottawa should be closed up, the officers in charge of it should be paid off and the offices closed. Canada has nothing to lose by doing this, and a large amount of money would be saved the taxpayers.
In my opinion Parliament can do only one of two things: Appropriate $100,000,000 at least, to build and equip an efficient navy, or else not spend one dollar. I do not think that in our present financial condition we can afford to spend the large amount which I have mentioned; consequently I say that not one dollar should be spent and not one man engaged at the present time under the excuse and pretence that we are doing something for naval affairs in this country. Sell off the useless trawlers, drifters and patrol boats, clear up the mes£ and make the * best of a bad job.
It might be said, of course, that we have the naval bases at Halifax and Esquimalt, and that they should be kept up. My answer to that is this: If the British Government require Halifax and Esquimalt for naval bases and for coaling purposes, they should take them over and operate them at their own expense. We certainly cannot do it, and I have no hesitation in asking that the whole idea be abandoned.",,,,

I understood from his remarks that these three gentlemen are military men. I have no objection to their appointment, but I would suggest for his consideration that he also appoint to that committee at least one business man. It seems to me that the matter should not be left entirely in the hands of men who have served in the army or who are officers of the Militia Department.
Dealing with section 2 of this Bill, I see that a part of the $350,000,000 to be borrowed is to be spent (a) for the defence and security of Canada; and (b) for the conduct of naval and military operations in or be-jond Canada and the demobilization of the Canadian forces. I do not think it is necessary to spend much time in discussing subsection (a), because the Minister of Militia, when his Estimates were being discussed recently, convinced me that it is not his intention to spend any money in the defence and security of Canada except what is absolutely necessary to continue the staff at headquarters and to provide for the upkeep of other pre-war military organizations in different parts of the country.
With regard to subsection (b), I am in hearty agreement with that portion which states that this money is to be spent for ""the demobilization of the Canadian forces."" I think we all agree that every effort should be made to have our Canadian boys returned from France and England at the earliest possible moment, so they may be discharged and take their place again in civil life. But with the first part of this

subsection ""for the conduct of naval and military .operations in or beyond Canada,""
I am not in agreement- I do not think it is necessary to provide that one dollar should be expended in military operations during' the year 1919, except as outlined by the Minister of Militia. Instead of spending money on military operations, we should strain every nerve to cut our expenditures down to the very lowest possible minimum. Let us see what we have spent for this purpose in the last four years. In 1914-15, the first year of the war, we spent $53,176,613.55; in 1915-16,	$160,433,416.42;
1916-17,	$298,291,030.66;	1917-18,	$316,669,-
871.95, and in 1918-19 to March 31, $289,229,119.38, making a total expenditure of $1,117,791,051-96 to equip and send our boys overseas and maintain them there. In addition there was spent on account of mUi-tary hospitals about $12,800,000, and with cur other expenditures in connection witn the war we spent up to March 31 of this year a total sum of $1,225,114,112.36. A great deal of criticism has been directed against the extravagant expenditure of part of this money, but so far as the Department of Militia and Defence is concerned, we have the satisfaction of knowing that while they have spent an enormous amount of money, and in some cases have spent it not as wisely as we would like to have it spent, yet they despatched at least 500,000 men overseas to fight for the Empire, and Canada to-day realizes that the splendid valour =hown by our soldiers on the battlefields of Flanders and Belgium fully justifies the action of the Department of Militia and Defence. 'Consequently, while as I said before there may be some criticism of the-manner in which portions of this large amount of money were spent, yet Canadians everywhere feel that they have received value in return for what has been disbursed.
What about the Naval Department? My good friend from Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) thinks that the naval defence of Canada is a great deal better than it really is. Perhaps the reason for that is that ""distance lends enchantment to the view,"" and my hon. friend, living as he does in Ottawa, does not know a great deal about naval defence on either the Atlantic or the Pacific coast. Since 1914 the enormous sum of $30,982,683.22 has been spent by the Naval Department on what is termed ""strictly war expenditure;"" and in addition millions of dollars have been expended in keeping up the dockyards and naval colleges at Halifax and Esqui-malt and in paying the salaries of officials

at Ottawa, Halifax and other places. Speaking for the moment of what is termed "" strictly war expenditure,"" in 1914-15, $3,096,125.35 was expended; in 1915-16, $3,274,019.94; in 1916-17, $3,806,329.19; in 1917-18, $9,666,229.14; and in 1918-19 to March 31, $11,139,979.60; making, as I said before, a grand total of $30,982,683.22 I am going to show, Mr. Chairman, that [DOT]this $31,000,000 was practically all wasted, that it was not spent in the interest of the taxpayers of Canada; that it was entirely unnecessary, and did not in any particular, or in any way help to defend Canada or to protect the property of her citizens.
Before trying to show the Committee exactly what has happened during the war, I think it would be well for a few moments to give the history of naval matters in Canada. In giving this short resume of naval history, I do not intend to deal with the matter from a political standpoint In 1909 Sir George Foster introduced into the House of Commons a resolution, the substance of which was that Canada should proceed with the building of a Canadian navy for the protection of our own coasts. This resolution, with a slight amendment made by the leader of the Government, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, was adopted by the whole House, the members being unanimous in their decision that this was the proper course to pursue. In 1911 the Government called for tenders for the construction of cruisers of the Bristol type, and at the time they went out of power in 1911 tenders had been received from a firm in Canada which was willing to build these ships. No action was taken on these tenders by the incoming Government, and the whole matter was dropped for a year or two until Sir Robert Borden introduced a resolution to pay to Britain $35,000,000 to purchase three dreadnoughts, and, in a speech delivered by him, abandoned the Canadian navy. Some of the arguments which were used by Sir Robert Borden were that it would take fifty years for Canadian workmen to leam how to build these ships, and that we could not supply riveters. In view of the fact that for the last few years Canadian workmen have been turning out steel ships in different shipyards in Canada, the argument is refuted that -we could neither build the ships nor provide the riveters. Most of the work which has been done in the last few years by Canadian workmen is second to none and will pass inspection by either Lloyds or the American Bureau of Shipping.
At the same time it will be remembered that Mr. Winston Churchill informed us 139
that there was no land in Canada suitable for building these ships, a statement which at the time was laughed to scorn by every person but those who wished to damn the idea of a Canadian navy.
The Senate of Canada refused to sustain the vote of the House of Commons, and consequently the $35,000,000 never reached England, and the whole matter of a Canadian navy or of a contribution to the British navy died a natural death.
It is true that at this time we had at Halifax the Niobe and at Esquimalt the Rainbow, two cruisers which had been purchased by the Liberal Government. Up to 1911 the crews of these ships had been kept at full strength and had been used for training purposes so that young Canadians could take courses in naval instruction. Shortly after Hon. J. D. Hazen assumed the position of Minister of Naval Affairs the crews of these ships were disbanded, the boys sent home and only a few men kept on board to act as caretakers. It is just as well-perhaps, though it is not as well- that the gentleman who was then Minister of Marine and Fisheries is not here to-night to answer what I have to say. I may add that I do not lay any blame at the door of the hon. gentleman who to-day has charge of the Department of Naval Affairs (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), because at the time he took charge, matters were in such a condition that it was impossible to remedy them. It is well, perhaps, that the gentleman who was in charge of naval affairs at that time now has a good, soft position in New Brunswick. A black eye was given the Canadian navy when the action of the then Minister of Naval Affairs showed that he was not in sympathy with any Canadian naval movement. Consequently, when the war broke out, the Niobe was not in fit condition to help protect the coast of Nova Scotia. Although immediately upon war being declared, orders were sent to Halifax to prepare the Niobe for sea and a part crew was sent from Esquimalt to man her, it was found that her boilers were in such condition that it would take several months to put her in a seaworthy condition. I make the statement here that if the Niobe had been ready to proceed to sea the morning that war was declared she would have succeeded in capturing prizes which would have p.aid the Canadian expenditure for war purposes during the first year of the war.
It was certainly humiliating for Canadians at Halifax to see this ship tied to her dock, grounded on her beef bones, weeks and weeks after hostilities had commenced



and also to know that the German-Hamburg liner Willehad, with a rich cargo on [DOT]board, worth millions of dollars, steamed down the gulf of St. Lawrence, proceeded along the Nova Scotia coast and sought refuge at Portland, while the Niobe was tied up with a chain at her port bow, a chain at her starboard bow, and two chains over her quarter deck so that she could not put to sea. It was also humiliating for Nova Scotians to know that the North-Ger-man-Lloyd steamer Princess Cecelia left Boston a day or two after war commenced with the most valuable cargo ever shipped from that port and with a million dollars of gold in her strong box, and that no effort could be made by the Niobe or by any Canadian cruiser to go out and capture that ship, although fishermen off Cape Sable reported seeing her steam down the Nova Scotia coast and leisurely turn back and make for Portland, Maine.
The Government awoke at last to the fact that something had to be done. They realized that the British Government required all their battleships, cruisers and destroyers to protect their own interests in the North sea and to keep the lanes oi commerce open; consequently they realized that they could not purchase or arrange with Britain for any of her ships. It became necessary for them, therefore, to endeavour to provide ways and means to protect some of the ports on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and they proceeded to waste money in the purchase of a lot of small boats which were utterly useless for defensive purposes. Orders were given to shipbuilding firms all over the country, and boats of the drifter and trawler class were contracted for and feverishly rushed to completion. A number of retired English officers were sent to this country to help organize a Canadian naval service. Naval recruits were asked for, captains and first mates were taken from the merchant marine service and held around Halifax for months drawing pay and doing nothing, for the simple reason that there was nothing for them to do. The story is a disgraceful one and should bring the blush of shame to every Canadian.
In the meantime there were being gathered at Halifax a motley collection oi broken-down tug-boats, gentlemens' yachts, second-hand trawlers and drifters and the new boats which were being launched. A few of these boats were used for gate purposes at Halifax and proved more of a nuisance to the shipping interests of the country than anything else. When it was
fMr. Duff.]
found that Halifax was full of these boats, a base was established at Sydney, and when the war came to a close some seventy-five boats of all kinds were tied up to the wharves in Sydney harbour. I have no hesitation in saying that the large expenditure of money for naval purposes at Sydney harbour was absolutely wasted; that no good resulted from having these boats in that harbour. Owing to their condition they were constantly undergoing repairs, most of them were unseaworthy and were not fit to go outside the headlands. It is true, that in this way they were given something to do. Some of these little gasoline patrol boats were sent out to Low Point and held up all Canadian fishing boats or schooners that came to Sydney harbour, instead of allowing them to pass without delay on their way in and out.
One of these boats known as the T. R. 30 was ordered to sea one morning, and on account of the condition of the boat's deck, seven of the seamen refused to proceed to sea unless the deck was caulked. Water had been pouring down the decks into the bunks of these seamen for several days. They reported the matter to their officer, and he reported it to the officer in command at Sydney, who refused to have anything done. These men were court-martialed and sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment, and the mayor of Halifax protested against the sentence. I purpose putting on record the correspondence between the mayor and Mr. Desbarats, Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs. This item first appeared in the Halifax Herald:
Major Hawkins says there were seventy-one prisoners at Rockhead on Sunday.
Rockhead is the Halifax jail or penitentiary, where these boys were incarcerated:
He told this at the Board of Control meeting yesterday, and said further that there were there since August last a number of boys, some of them from good families and environment, who say that they complained at 'Sydney of unseaworthiness of a trawler on which they were serving, were tried there by court martial, brought here in irons and put in the city prison for eighteen months. The mayor said he had written the minister. Hon. Mr. Ballantyne, in reference to the matter. ""Shipping laws are severe"", said His Worship, ""but it strikes me these boys got a raw deal from the Naval Department. They say no naval rules or regulations were read to them."" His Worship' was informed that the boys had refused to go. to sea in the trawlers. If they had deserted,, they might have got but ninety days. They were ignorant of what they were doing, he said..
This item must have come to the attention of Mr. Desbarats, Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs, and he wrote Mayor Haw-

kins at Halifax the following letter on January 29, 1919:
Dear Sir:
In the absence of the minister I am answering your letter of the 21st regarding seven seamen from T.R. 30 who were court-martialed and sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment for ""wilful disobedience of lawful command.""
I do not think there is much justification for the statement that these men were not fairly treated at their trial or were given a raw deal. The men were part of the crew of one of the .trawlers doing convoy work at Sydney in protecting the vessels sailing out of that port. These men refused to take the ship out when she was ordered for duty with the convoy and the mercantile vessels sailed without the protection of this trawler. The offence whs a very serious one and if the convoy had been attacked the absence of this trawler in the line might have allowed of the sinking of one or more of the convoyed ships.
That is the most ridiculous statement 1 ever saw put on paper by a responsible officer, and I say without hesitation there was not in Sydney a patrol boat, not to speak of the T.E. 30, which could convoy any vessel or protect any merchant or other ship. The letter continues:
There was no question as to the seaworthiness of T.R. 30. She is one of a number of similar ships which have proved to be thoroughly seaworthy and staunch. The complaint made by the men was that water leaked from the deck into their quarters and rendered them uncomfortable and insanitary. An inspection was made at the time by the Warrant Shipwright, who reported slight leaks but nothing of a serious kind.
So it is admitted there was some ground for the boys' compla'int. The letter continues:
Even supposing that there had been serious leaks and that a good deal of water leaked into the men's quarters, this would have been no reason for refusing duty and for preventing the ship to take her place in the line and do her share in protecting the convoy.
The men stated that, they were quite aware of the seriousness of refusing duty but notwithstanding this they took the action related above. If men on active service were allowed to refuse duty on acoount of uncomfortable surroundings there would be no need of any defensive or offensive warfare. The offence committed by the men was quite serious, they took the action with full knowledge of its gravity, they pleaded guilty to the charge of disobedience, they were tried in an open court and given every opportunity to present any defence which they might have, and there is no justification for a charge of unfair treatment on the part of the authorities.
These men can hardly be classed as boys, as their ages vary from eighteen to twenty-eight, with an average of twenty-three, and they are therefore quite old enough to realize their [DOT]responsibilities.	.
It is to he regretted that ilt should have been necessary to sentence these men to punish-
139i
ment but it does not seem possible to maintain discipline in a fleet if men are to he allowed to refuse their duty on the grounds of personal disoomfort especially as in this case the discomfort would hardly seem to have been of a serious nature.
I trust these explanations will show that there was good ground for punishing these men and that there was no injustice in the sentence which they received.
Yours truly,
(Signed) G. J. Destoarats,
Deputy Minister.
My understanding of the matter is that these boys were poor boys from the country who knew nothing about military or naval regulations, and if, as Mr. Desbarats says, they pleaded guilty, what
10 p.m. else could they do when they were before the court-martial? I suppose they thought the best thing they could do was to say whatever the court wanted them to say. This, letter of Mr. Desbarats did not satisfy Mayor Hawkins, and on February 1, 1919, he replied as follows to Mr. Desbarats:
Dear Sir,-In answer to your letter of the 29th ultimo, it is my desire that my letter of the 21st ultimo regarding the seven seamen from the T.R. 30, who were court-martialed and sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment for ""willful disobedience of lawful command,"" he placed before a responsible minister in the absence of the minister of your department.
_ There has been a good deal of feeling aroused in this community on account of the way ip which these seamen were treated ; the sentence imposed is looked upon as very much out of proportion, compared with other sentences of officers who have been court martialed.
The story of a certain Lieutenant Legatt, late commanding Officer of the II.M.C.S. Hoche-laga, who was court martialed and honourably discharged from service for cowardice, has been mentioned in the public press. It -would he interesting to know, as the court martial was held on these boys on the Hochelaga, if this officer had anything to do in passing sentence upon the offenders from the T.R. 30.
There are other instances where it would seem to show that there is a law for officers and another for seamen.
Yours trply,
(Signed) A. C. Hawkins,
Mayor.
In view of these facts, if these boys have not already been released, the acting Minister of Naval Affairs (Mr. A. K. Maclean) should draw the matter to the attention of the minister and have these boys released from jail immediately, and make proper restitution. An hon. member asked the Department of Naval Affairs for some information in regard to this trawler upon which these boys served, and it was necessary for him to ask the question several times before he could get very much in-

formation. Some of the questions asked by this member were as follows:
Was trawler No. 30 in the service of the Canadian Navy Department during the summer of 1918?
The answer was ""yes.""
If so, were any refits necessary to this boat during the summer of 1918?
The answer was ""no."" This is the summer the boys were sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment.
On what date was this boat laid up for refits?
The answer was:
Answered by No. 2.
There were no refits, said the department.
Where was trawler No. 30 on August 9, 1918?
The answer was:
At Sydney, under routine lay-up.
If there was nothing wrong with this boat, why was it lying at Sydney under routine lay-up unless that was the excuse for having all the boats tied up at the wharves at Sydney? But I have absolute information that these answers are not correct, and I say that on August 14, 1918, the Sydney Foundry Company completed the work of caulking and pitching the deck of this trawler, the amount of the account being $284. This was the boat from which these seven poor seamen were court mar-tialed and sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment, and yet within a fortnight after they were sentenced, this boat was laid up for refits and the deck caulked and pitched by the Sydney Foundry Company at a cost to this country of $284. Let us go a little further in this matter. Who were the gentlemen who court martialed these seven poor seamen from a fishing hamlet on the Atlantic coast? There was a steamer on naval duty called the Hochelaga, which was commanded by a certain gentleman and which was sent to sea on patrol duty. The look-out on this naval patrol boat one morning sighted a submarine; he reported the matter to the captain, and the captain, who was in charge of eight or ten small boats in addition to his own, at once put up signals to return to port, and instead of stopping and endeavouring to get that submarine or be sunk in the attempt, the captain of the Hochelaga deliberately turned tail and proceeded back to port. This captain is one of the three men who sentenced those seven poor Nova Scotia fishermen to eighteen months in the penitentiary. It is true that after the Hochelagf
fMr. Duff.]
returned to port and the naval authorities came into possession of the fact that the captain had acted in a cowardly manner they discharged him. But why in the name of common sense was he allowed to go with an honourable discharge, while these seven poor Nova Scotian fishermen were sen tenced to eighteen months at Eockhead? Is that fair play? Is that in keeping with the traditions of the British navy? No; and I say action should be taken to release these boys from Eockhead and make whatever restitution is possible.
We have endeavoured to get information from the Department of Naval Service this session with regard to some of the steamers it employs, but in nearly every case the answer has been unsatisfactory or contradictory. I think the truth of the matter is-that the Government are ashamed of the whole sorry mess of bungling extravagance and mismanagement of the naval affairs of this country since the war started.
To show the uselessness of the steamers composing this so-called navy, let me give one or two illustrations. On a fine summer day in 1918 the oil-tanker Lux Blanca, having discharged her cargo at the Imperial Oil works at Dartmouth, got up steam for sea. She was an American boat manned by American sailors and captained by an American ship-master. She proceeded out of the harbour and headed westward. When thirty-five miles west of Sambro island, the lookout sighted the periscope of a submarine. Let me say at this point that previous to this date the naval authorities at Halifax and Ottawa knew there was a submarine on the Nova Scotia coast, yet nothing was done. There were no patrol boats outside the headlands of Halifax harbour. When the lookout sighted the periscope of the submarine what did the captain of this oil-tanker do? Did he turn tail as the captain of the Hochelaga did? No. He had a gun forward and another gun aft, and he had these guns manned and trained on the periscope of the submarine. He gave instructions to the wireless operator to send a message to the Halifax station that he was attacked by a submarine and to send help. He turned his ship towards Halifax harbour and fought that submarine for three hours. The message was sent to Halifax about two in the afternoon, but, Mr. Chairman, not a boat left Halifax to go to that ship's assistance, and the result was that some of the crew of that oil tanker were killed, some were wounded, the ship was sunk, and the rest of the crew had to

[DOT]take to the boats. I admit that there were no ships in our naval fleet that could have sunk the submarine, but they could have done this: When that S.O.S. call came the naval authorities should have sent those boats to sea. I do not blame the captains or crews of those boats or drifters; I lay the blame on the men in charge of the naval base at Halifax, most of whom do not belong to this country, but were sent over from England after their period of usefulness there had,finished. Every man who knows anything about the business says that when that S.O.S. call came the naval authorities should have sent those boats out to sea because, whilst they may not have been able to sink the submarine, the minute the submarine sighted their smoke on the horizon, the good black smoke from Sydney coal, she would have disappeared and the oil tanker would have been saved. While this vessel was being sunk the naval officials at Halifax were trifling at pink teas and playing bridge whist. That is the way we were protected on the Nova Scotia coast.
Let me give another instance-I have five hundred pages here, and it will be impossible for me to give it all. The Lady Evelyn was one of the best boats in the patrol service. She had first class equipment; in fact, naval officers tell me that she was the only vessel in the fleet that could have engaged a submarine. While this submarine was off the Nova Scotia coast, the Lady Evelyn, the best equipped vessel in the fleet, was sent to the Magdalen islands to deliver six lead pencils to the wireless operator there. There were at this time some American destroyers also on our coast, and about the same day the Lady Evelyn went to the Magdalen islands to deliver the lead pencils, an American destroyer was off Cape Canso. This was twenty-four hours before the fishing vessels were sunk in those waters. This American destroyer received a call to return to Halifax. When the commander of the destroyer received the call he wired back that he had information a submarine was in his zone. Nevertheless, he was ordered back to Halifax on some paltry excuse, and when he got there he was sent out on convoy with the ship that was to take Prince Arthur of Cbn-naught to England. Whilst the fishermen were left to row a hundred and forty miles, this American destroyer was sailing out with Prince Arthur. Is that the way to treat the people of this country? That is what actually happened.
Let me'go a little further. Two German submarines came across the water last May. They operated first on the American coast. The Naval Department here knew all about them, and I might say that I sent several telegrams about the matter myself to Mr, Desbarats. These submarined sunk a number of American ships off the American coast, and gradually worked down the Bay of Fundy sinking vessels belonging to merchants of St, John, New Brunswick, some of them new vessels with valuable cargoes, The submarines next appeared off Cape Sable, then off Shelburne and proceeded down the Nova Scotia coast. In the town of Liverpool, at the time, three large vessels were preparing for sea. There were four or five in my home town, and several in the Lahave river preparing for sea, and to proceed to foreign ports These captains, notwithstanding the fact that they knew that the submarine was coming down the Nova iScotia coast, proceeded to sea on their voyage. They did not fear the submarine; they did not fear the Germans. No; it was the patrol boats and those others who were the ones that were making all the trouble. This submarine after destroying the Lux Blanca, proceeded down the co'ast off Canso. You will probably remember, Mr. Chairman, that the first ship she sank was a trawler belonging to parties in the constituency of the hon. Acting Minister of Naval Affairs (Mr. A. K. Maclean). While the American destroyer that was sent down by the United States to protect our coast was sent to Halifax to convoy a ship on which was Prince Arthur of Connaught, the submarine sank five or six Nova Scotia vessels and one American vessel, and the fishermen were ordered into their dories. Hon. members may not all know what a dory is. It is a small boat about fifteen feet long capable of containing only two men. These fishermen were given five minutes to leave the ship and take to their dories and then had to row for two days and two nights before reaching Canso. And this was the kind of protection we were receiving from the naval service of this country. The submarine proceeded down the St. Pierre banks and this is the time the Hochelaga turned tail, when the submarine was about 50 miles off Sydney harbour. As I say, she proceeded down the St. Pierre banks and several more fishing vessels anchored there were sunk. The crews had to row about 45 miles to St. Pierre and arriving there-I think there were about 110 men altogether-the Governor of St. Pierre realized that provisions were short and that it was advis-

able to despatch these men as quickly as possible, and cabled, I presume, to the Ottawa authorities, because shortly afterwards instructions were forwarded to Sydney to despatch one of the patrol boats to St. Pierre to bring the Lunenburg county fishermen to that port. My information is, and 1 believe it is correct, that on that occasion, because the boat was unseaworthy, the whole crew refused to go to sea and the captain had to get an entire new crew, except himself and the wireless operator. I do not know where he got them from, but I am informed that on the way back from St. Pierre to North Sydney, although it was not very rough, every man jack aboard the trawler was sick, except the captain and the wireless operator, and the fishing crew had to do the crew's work and help bring the patrol from St. Pierre to North Sydney. That is the kind of naval service we get in Canada.
Then they tell a story, and it is a true one, that when one of the fishing vessels was coming up in the fog off Halifax harbour the man on the lookout did not see the patrol boats, but he said he smelled ham and eggs, and shortly after the fog lifted there were about ten of these patrol boats in the shelter of Sambro Light. They did not come alongside the ship and tell them that there was a submarine in the vicinity, but allowed that vessel with twenty valuable lives to proceed on her way without notifying the captain of the danger. It seems to me that the least they might have done was to apprise him of the presence of the submarine so that the captain could put into Halifax harbour. Another method that was practiced was to get men for these ships by robbing the merchant marine. Every vessel that came to Halifax from a foreign voyage with crews that had been facing the submarine in the submarine zone in Spanish waters, in the Mediterranean and nearly every place else where the submarine was most in evidence, these men having faced these grave dangers for six, nine and twelve months, on arriving at Halifax they were arrested by the military police and put in jail. I know of one case-and I can . mention more-in which the mate of ,a ship called the Win the War was arrested and put in jail by the military police. The mate of a vessel that arrived in Halifax one Saturday morning was arrested and put in the lockup over Sunday, taken to Aldershot and kept in custody for a week until the owners of his vessel got him out. We are supposed to emulate the example of Great Britain, and yet this condition of affairs existed in spite of the fact that Great Bri-

JULIEN.,,,"With regard to France, I may repeat to my hon. friend what I said the other night. The first country that we approached, long before the armistice and immediately after, in relation to reconstruction business was France. The matter was taken up with the French representative at Washington, and it was taken up overseas directly with the French Government by the Minister of Trade and Commerce and Mr. Lloyd Harris, and also, I may say, by the Prime Minister; and we offered her a credit of-well, we put no limit to it. What I had in mind was a credit of from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000. No question arises of France's future. We offered her such a credit as she might require for purchases in Canada. But I

think the position of France is this, she has her own situation in regard to industries and employment, and very naturally she desires, to the extent of her ability, to do her own restoration through her own manufacturers and to give her own people employment. Consequently up to date she has not felt it necessary to avail herself of the offer of credit which I can again assure my hon. friend and this House it would have been a pleasure to us to extend to her for making purchases in this country. I have indicated all the credits that have been extended, with the exception of those which we have been giving to Great Britain and which we shall have to give. I assure the leader of the Opposition that no one will be more relieved than I shall when free markets are restored for wheat, flour, and all other commodities, so that men will carry on their business in the way they did in 1911. The hon. gentleman seemed to indicate that he thought- we were blameable because we do not do business now as we did in 1911. But he has overlooked one very important	consideration

something	for
which William Hohenzollern is responsible, not myself- and that is, the war. The reason why we have to do business in this way is that since 1911 we have had the war and we have not yet been able, as a country, to get back to the normal manner of doing business as my hon. friend described it. My own view is that as soon as industrial conditions permit, as soon as business can be done through the ordinary channels, the Dominion Government should not make any loans for the purpose of facilitating the sale of our products. The natural way is to have them taken care of through ordinary commercial and financial channels. What the Government has done it has done for two reasons: In the first place, to provide employment for those in Canada who would otherwise be out of work and to keep our factories going; and, in the second place, to extend the export trade of the country.
With regard to the -placing of orders, a point was raised the other night about commissions. I made careful inquiry of Mr. Lloyd Harris over there; he knows nothing of any commission paid in respect of the business. I also served notice upon the Trade Commission here that it was not necessary that commissions of any kind should be paid, and that no orders should be placed with firms that were paying commissions or remunerations to any outside of their own employees or organization. This business is obtained in London. The

agents of, say, 'the Rumanian Government know what they want. They deal there through the Canadian Trade Mission, and with the representatives of the various branches of Canadian manufacture. They bargain as to the prices to he paid, and they see the samples-our men are in competition with others who are competing for the same business-and then the order is placed through the Trade Commission here, which is officered by very capable and honourable men. It seems to me that we could not devise any better means of getting business for all the manufacturers of Canada than we have devised by the establishment of this Mission in London and of its complement, the Canadian Trade Mission here. It is easy to criticise, and it is hard to construct and create. But this organization which we have built up and which at the time of its inception had the commendation of the people of Canada-it was a very live question here-is to-day keeping thousands of people at work, is promoting the industry and the commerce of the country, and, 1 submit, should be commended by hon. gentlemen opposite when they get to understand it fully. At the head of our Trade Commission here is Sir Charles Gordon, a very able and honourable man, as the member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) said the other night. In London we have Mr. Lloyd Harris, who is well known, I think, to most members of this House. So far as I am aware, the Government's action is such as the Government should take at a time like this. Let us look forward to a period-I do not know how far distant; I hope not far distant-when the Dominion Government will not have to provide credits; thfen we shall have the benefit of all this connection that has been established with foreign countries. Our goods will get to be known, and an impetus will be given to all the industry of the country.
As to indebtedness on the part of one Government to another, that is usually a very honourable obligation of Governments and I have no doubt whatever that the advances which are being made by the Dominion Government, substantial sums as they are, will be repaid in due course, as soon as peace conditions permit these nations again to get upon their feet, and as soon as international exchange is restored.

JULIEN.,,,"I cannot say as to that; but these goods are being purchased by Governments, and Governments could no doubt arrange to have them go in free of duty. Our relationship is not with individuals in these countries, but with Governments. For example, we give the Belgium Government a credit of $25,000,000, and Belgium is going to send a mission out here to purchase. The Belgian Government, having borrowed the money from us, and being, as I believe, entirely responsible, will use its credit in this country to purchase to the best advantage. I think the Hudson's Bay Company has been doing some buying for the Belgian Government. I believe that Greece also will send a mission here to purchase. Of the Rumanian credit, $5,000,000 is in wheat, another $5,000000 is in raw material-that has not yet been purchased-and the ' balance is in manufactured products, such as clothing, woollens, textiles, agricultural implements, and, I hope, some railway equipment; in other words, what they need in order to restore their country.
Hon. gentlemen may say that Canada is taking some risk in this matter. Well, let us assume that we are. Having regard to the situation in which the country found itself in November last, facing this collapse in its industries, Canada is abundantly justified in doing what the United States has been doing on an immense scale, and what Great Britain is doing. This war has caused so profound a dislocation in the world, in finance, commerce and industry, that if during this year, which, in a sense, is a war year, because we have the consequences of the war with us, we failed in courage or in resource, the situation would be different in Canada from what it is to-day. I do not believe hon. gentlemen, no matter how well informed they may be, quite appreciate what 'the Government's financing has done and is doing for this country to-day. If you take the gratuity which we gave the soldiers; if you take the payments to the soldiers that the Minister of Militia has referred

to; if you take our shipbuilding programme; if you take the immense expenditures we are obliged to make for the financing of our grain purchases and our manufactured products that I have mentioned- hundreds of dollars-and then imagine the situation if the Government on November 11 had said:	""Now we quit right here;
the war is at an end; no more credits for wheat or meats or manufactured products; let private enterprise carry on the business itself. Well, I would be taking a ticket out of the country, because I would not desire to face the situation which would have resulted. Imagine the activities of this country, stimulated as they were during .the war, keyed up to a height that none of us believed they could attain, and then everything suddenly stop. If the Government had not come to the rescue as they did, with courage and resource, and provide the credits we did, there would have been a very serious situation in Canada.

JULIEN.,,,"The statements made by the hon. member (Mr. Duff) with regard to expenditures in connection with naval affairs in Canada are of such a serious character that we should at least have some explanation from the minister before this clause is adopted.	[DOT]
, We have the statement made here by . the hon. member, not as his own, but as a declared statement by an officer who was one of the men in charge at Esquimalt at the time, I believe, and who professes to make a declaration, equal to a statement on oath, as to what has been taking place in connection with the handling of the navy, not only on the coast of British Columbia, but at Halifax, ISydney and other

places. We have not, so far, had a word of explanation from the Government. There may be some minister or other hon. member who* can give us some explanation about this matter, but we have not had a word of explanation, and we are asked to vote $350,000,000, a large part of which is going to be paid out in connection with work of this class. While we are all anxious to get along as fast as we can with the business of this session, including the voting of money, this (Committee and the House and the country are entitled to some explanation as to the charges put forward in respect to the management of this very important department of Government. 'It is well known, in the part of the country from which I come, which is in the same province as the constituency represented by the hon. member (Mr. Duff), that moneys were simply squandered right and left; that every sort of a boat that would float at all was either purchased or hired, and that it was the sheerest mockery the piles of ships that were in each others' way in the harbour of Sydney during the last year or two doing nothing in the world except paying out money to men who were friendly to the Government and who had craft of this kind -to sell or hire. Without some departmental head here able to answer these questions, it would be useless to make-any further charges than those already put before the Committee by the hon. member for Lunenburg, and I do not wish to take up time of re-stating what has been so well said by him. But it is the duty of the Government, and particularly of the minister in charge of this Bill, if he cannot give this explanation himself, to let this matter ""stand until the minister who is capable of giving the explanation is here and can tell us how many vessels were purchased or hired; from whom vessels were purchased or hired; what was the necessity of hiring vessels; how many vessels we still own; and what are they worth; and what the Government intends doing with them? I suggested to the Minister of Naval Affairs that such of the 11 p.m. vessels as are equal to the kind of work, should, if possible, be converted into fishing craft. The Canadian people would get more value and better results from those vessels in that way than in any other. I do not know that this is the occasion to discuss that, but I am mentioning it in the presence of so many ministers, that they may have at least one constructive idea in connection with the handling of those boats. I am told that [Mr. McKenzie. 1
many of the boats can be sold to advantage to fishermen who, perhaps, may not be able to pay the whole of the money at once, but a scheme could be arranged by which the Government would be sure of obtaining its money and a fishing fleet of fine proportions, well equipped, would be established on both the Atlantic and the Pacific. If this matter is inquired into at all, we shall be able to get some information from the minister on that score.
At an early stage in the evening, the hon. member for Pontiac (Mr. Cahill) made some statements in connection with the furnishing of money for trade purposes. The hon. member for Vancouver Centre (Mr. Stevens) thought that he was making a very clever answer when he told us that we were perfectly justified in voting J25,-000,000 of the people's money to Rumania, because Rumania was in debt to Great Britain and that we were in debt to _ Great Britain and the United States, and in order to square our bills with Great Britain and the United States, we should allow Rumania to become indebted to us. If that is a business proposition by which there shall be accorded any satisfaction in the payment of debts between Rumania and Great Britain, Great Britain and ourselves and ourselves and the United States, it is a system that I never heard of before and that I do not understand. The hon. member sat down absolutely satisfied with himself as having solved the whole problem and having justified the borrowing by Canada of $25,000,000 somewhere and passing that over to Rumania in order that Rumania might become indebted to us. If that is business, I shall be glad to have it more fully explained by the minister if he shall deem it proper to make any further observations in connection with this Bill.
There are different ways of promoting trade. When we were in pow'er in this country we promoted trade in the usual way. We wanted to have trade with people who. were willing to pay either in kind or in cash for our goods. In 1911, the situation in this country was excellent, but we wanted to make it better and we launched upon a comprehensive trade arrangement with the people of the United States and other countries where we could get proper trade and where we would have exchange of our goods for theirs or get their money for our goods. That was not good enough for the statesmen who are to-day in charge of affairs, and they turned it down. What have they given to us instead of it? They have given us an

absolutely new idea in trade, namely, that we are to furnish our own money and that we are to buy our own goods, and after we have bought our goods from ourselves, we are to pass them over without any security whatever to a foreign country. Will the minister explain how it is that we are going to get wealthy in that way? Supposing a man furnishes a customer with $5 to buy a pair of boots, the man comes in to his store and buys the boots and he passes over to the [DOT] merchant his own $5. The merchant has his 35 back in his till, but the boots are gone and he has nothing for them. I see many hardheaded business men sitting in front of me, and I should like them to explain how we are going to grow wealthy and expand and develop the country by such a system of trade.
The idea of a man lifting himself by his boot straps has always seemed the most ridiculous thing we could imagine, but I think such a feat is just as easily possible as the making of this country wealthy and prosperous upon the system of trade, and business generally, that is followed by this Government, and which is applauded by its Supporters as a new device which will overcome all the trade ills that the state is heir to. As a matter of fact, we have not got the money to give, but we are undertaking to find it in some way, and pass it off in the manner I have mentioned. 'I submit to you, Mr. Chairman, that whether or not this will be a bribe to the manufacturers of this country, to the big combines, the big friends who own the Government according to the Government's own friends, it is capable ol being a bribe. What is happening? The Manufacturers' Association and the men engaged in big business come to the Government and say: "" We want more trade. We want more money put in circulation. What are you going to do about it?"" The Government says: "" If you can get anybody to buy your goods we will pay for them."" That is a magnificent proposition. The manufacturer is not asked what his price is, where he will deliver the goods, or anything of that kind; he is simply told by the Government: ""We care not what you produce, so long as it is a manufactured article of any kind. If you will pile it on the shore at Montreal, Halifax, St. John, or Vancouver, and get a certified account from somebody whom we will appoint at these places, we will put you in the way of getting a cheque for your goods."" Is not that a magnificent layout for the manufacturers? They do not send travelling agents abroad; they are free from that expense. They do not bother
about insuring their goods and sending them across the Atlantic; they do not worry about transportation or freight or anything else. All they have to do is produce the goods, and then this paternal fraternity known as the Government will furnish the cash and take full responsibility for everything. If that is not a scheme by which men who have goods to sell are capable of being bribed, I do not know what scheme you could devise that would be more capable of being used for bribery. I am not saying that that is what the scheme is for, but it is an old saying that the sight of means to do ill deeds, has ill deeds done. It would be better to let the men on this side of the Atlantic who have goods to sell do business direct with the men on the continent of Europe who want to buy their goods, instead of the Government engineering the thing so that the manufacturers can sell their goods for what they like without the purchaser having anything to say about it. When this matter was up about two weeks ago, the complaint was made that there was no proper distribution of these orders. Some person said there was no such thing at all as orders of this kind, but the hon. jnember for Haldimand (Mr. Lalor) who, I believe, is a manufacturer or .interested in manufacturing, told us all about it. He said that the orders were distributed in the best possible way, that there was no discrimination, that everybody got a share. Nevertheless, the distribution of the orders is made by a combination of manufacturers who come together and fix their own price; they divide the orders up just as they like, and then the Government undertakes all the hard work of getting the money to pay for the goods. That is not a proper or healthy way of doing business, and the sooner we get away from it the better.
I submit that we have not been given the necessary information about this money which we are going to give to foreign countries for the purpose of stimulating trade in Canada. We do not know how much we are going to give-at least I do not; we do not know how it is to be handled; we do not know how the goods are to be bought; we do not know how they are to be conveyed from this country to their destination. When we are furnishing money in this way to help out foreigners, I submit, we should know something about it. There is all the more reason for this information because of conditions to-day, when the price

not only of foodstuffs but of manufactured articles is such that if the price were reduced to normal the sales of the manufacturers [DOT] could be doubled and trebled and our men kept at work without sending goods out of the country at all. I think that before we accept the proposition of the manufacturers, there should be the closest possible inquiry into the conditions; and the method which evidently has been adopted by the Government should only be resorted to in the last extremity when nothing else could be done to carry on trade and keep our men employed.
The information we particularly desire is in connection with the expenditure on naval affairs. We also require a little further explanation about the money we are going to borrow and pass over to foreign countries. It might be somewhat difficult for the minister to give this information to-night, but as we are entitled to it, if no other hon. member wishes to speak, I would suggest that at this late hour the minister should let the Bill stand in Committee.

The member for Dundas (Mr. Casselman) said a few minutes ago, that owing to the fact that there might be habitual cases of carelessness on the part of merchants or their employees this clause, in his estimation, was all right. But I submit it is not the habitual offenders that will suffer and feel the consequent exposure most, but the casual offender. The person who has really committed an offence under this clause-not intentionally, not knowingly, not wilfully, but by mere accident; you may call it negligence, a term that the Acting Minister of Justice is very fond of

will be the one to suffer, although the offence may be an accident purely and simply, I think it is the feeling of those members of the Committee who have given the matter careful consideration that there should be some safeguard provided so as to protect a merchant against such imposition as has been referred to, viz: that a dissatisfied employee might, in order to get even with his employer, act in collusion with a friend who would institute a prosecution for short measure. There are a thousand and one ways in which a merciiant might not only be penalized, but exposed to the odium which such proceedings involves, although that merchant is a conscientious person who gives the public the best of service and full measure and full weight in the sales which he makes. Like my hon. friend from George Etienne Cartier (Mr. Jacobs), I am willing and desirous that the public should be protected to the last degree in a matter of this kind, and that every safeguard should be attached to purchases by the public; but you can make the penalties resulting from proceedings under the Act so irksome, irritating, and annoying to the persons interested that it will be a continual source of worry to them. From week-end to weekend, and from year to year they will always be in terror of suffering seriously by reason of a slight deviation from the exact line of measure. As I said before, in my experience in mercantile affairs, covering a period of forty years, I have found that the measures going over a counter, either in. yardage or weight, vary as often
one way as the other. In a hasty operation of the scale or the yard measure an employee, even with the best of care, is liable to give over measure or short measure. Now the employee who has given in one case short measure even to the extent of a hair's breadth, is liable to a penalty under this Bill. I submit that the minister will be well advised if he listens to reason, reconsiders his decision, and inserts in this clause some qualifying provision.

the cases are quite comparable. Whether or not a stamp was affixed to a package of patent medicines is a fact easily established; if it was not affixed, technically the offender is guilty.

The point raised by the hon. member for Kent is well taken, and I regret to state that officers in this connection are not always, like Caesar's wife, above reproach. I have had similar experiences to that indicated by him. I know a case where an officer of the department visited the town of Renfrew and tried his level best to induce junior employees to
deliver to him packages without a stamp on them, and he knew they should have been stamped, but he endeavoured to induce the employees to commit an offence under the Stamp Act. I know that from personal experience. The same man operated in every store in that town on the same occasion along the same lines. I feel that no merchant would be any safer in the hands of an official of this department. This will be the last and final appeal from me in this regard. I have known cases where dishonest buyers tried to make believe that their measure was short. The merchant has no protection under this Bill in cases where customers take the goods home, remove a portion of them and come back to the store claiming that the weight or measure was. short.

The operating words of the section are that either of the pa*ties ""represents or pretends"" that the man is the husband or the woman is the wife. What I say is that this should not be an offence unless the person who thus represents or pretends, knows that the statement is not true.

complete statement as to that, and I desire to say to the leader of the Opposition, and to hon. gentlemen to your left, Mr. Chairman, that I find no fault whatever with the question being raised, because an important Bill deserves serious consideration in Committee, and it is not my custom to withhold information if I can furnish it.
I desire to say to the hon. leader of the Opposition that we are in good company in what we are doing. The United States has loaned, during the war, and is loaning now, billions of dollars to the nations of Europe to enable them during the war to conduct military operations, and since to buy the products of the United States. The United States must continue to do that through her Government and her financial institutions if she is to get trade. To put it another way, if Europe is to be supplied with foodstuffs and manufactured products from this continent Europe cannot pay for them, and this continent cannot sell them unless the money is found on this side of the Atlantic. There is no business man on this side of the House who does not know that that is so. The United States has been pushing very strongly for business, as my hon. friend says, but she has been in the powerful position of being able to offer credits. Her wheat, her meats and all her other foodstuffs of every kind she can sell to Europe, but Europe cannot sell European exchange against New York exchange to pay for them; Europe has to borrow from the United States. That borrowing will he done partly from the American Government and partly by the ordinary operations between banks, and by the sale in the United States of securities of European countries.
Great Britain for many years had the greatest money market in the world in London, and foreign governments came there and sold their securities, which were taken up by British investors, and in that way the money was furnished in 'London for the purchases which were made in Great Britain. Now you have this situation on the North American continent. Our people and the people of the United States are not accustomed to buying the securities of foreign governments. The United States is
14D
very slowly becoming an international money centre because her people, until this war, had not been accustomed-as were the British people-to purchasing the securities of foreign governments. Whether they will become so accustomed to doing that as to constitute New York a great international financial centre like London, in which the securities of foreign governments will be dealt in, I do not pretend to say. It will take probably a long ' time before that is accomplished. But the United States Government has been furnishing immense sums of money to the European countries, as I have said, in order that they might purchase foodstuffs and the goods required from the United States.
I think the amount loaned to Great Britain alone is between four and five billion dollars for commodities so purchased. That was not loaned in gold and shipped overseas; it was a credit given at Washington, and Great Britain by means of that credit purchased in the United States the goods she required. She wanted the goods, and she could not buy them unless she got that credit.
With regard 'to Rumania, I would ask hon. gentlemen to bear in mind that she could have kept out of the war. She came into it at a very critical period and made great sacrifices for the common cause- 1 am not prepared to say that many thousands of Canadian lives have not been saved lby the intervention of Rumania. If hon. gentlemen will look at the map of Europe they will see that Rumania, is a; great salient projecting into Austria-Hungary, exposed to attack on both front and flank-Bulgaria to the south,. Austria-Hungary to 'the north and west. Rumania risked her all in coming into this war, and she lost for the time being, but she made the sacrifice. Sentimentally, therefore, I do not think we should be quick to reflect too much upon the credit -of Rumania, devastated as she has been by the war, prosecuted by her in common cause with the Allies. Rumania is not so strong financially, of course, as Belgium and France, but she must be restored. Her fields have been devastated, her cattle carried off; and her people need food and clothing and agricultural implements. How are they going to get them? If they do not get food they will starve; if they do not get clothing the consequences will be serious from exposure; if they do not get agricultural implements their tillage cannot be restored. Rumania is a very rich country, rich in her fertile plains, her splendid forests and her great oil resources, and she will get upon her



feet rapidly once she gets a chance- Now, who is going to supply to Rumania the wheat to feed her population, the clothing to protect them from the elements, and the agricultural implements and railway equipment required for the restoration of their tillage and their transportation facilities? There is an opportunity there for some nation. The United States have seized that opportunity. Since the armistice, to say nothing of before, the United States have roamed Rumania $25,000,000-I ascertained that from Washington-and all that money is being spent in the United States.
Now, our Trade Commission in London approached Belgium, France and the other nations of Europe requiring supplies of various kinds of food and for the restoration of their countries, and ascertained that there was a splendid opening for business in the Balkans, the business that I have mentioned, good for the time being to keep our factories going and afford employment to our artisans and work people, and good in its promise for the future. Rumania, as I have said, could not purchase supplies in Canada unless a credit were established; neither could France, nor Belgium; and I pointed out that even England could not purchase unless we gave her credit. We gave a credit of $25,000,000 to Rumania; we gave a credit of $25,000,000 to Greece, whose future is of the brightest; we gave a credit of $25,000,000 to Belgium, and I believe she will speedily recover from the effects of the war. Belgium is a very rich country, and is now assured of protection by the League of Nations and by the interest which Great Britain and France notably have in the preservation of its integrity.

That treaty was ratified by Act of Parliament, and its provisions were embodied in the Migratory Birds Convention Act. The provinces, of course, had their own game laws, and, in the main, were enforcing them; but those provincial laws did not go far enough to ensure the protection of migratory birds. The subject matter having been dealt with by international treaty, the Dominion acquires jurisdiction; but the Dominion thought-and the migratory birds legislation is based entirely upon this hypothesis-that provincial legislation would be enacted to bring the laws in each province into conformity with the several provisions of the treaty and to provide for their enforcement. That hope has, to a large extent, been realized. Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta have brought their game laws into full conformity with the Migratory Birds Convention; British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec have brought their laws into substantial conformity-for all practical purposes, into full conformity -with the provisions of the convention and are in a reasonable manner carrying out those laws. But we have not been able to secure from the Maritime Provinces the legislation desired. New Brunswick, instead of bringing its legislation up to the requirements of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, has repealed its legislation altogether and throws the whole onus on the Dominion, very much to the disappointment of those who have at heart the enforcement of our migratory bird laws. Nova Scotia has not gone so far as that. Perhaps, in order to be accurate, I had better read just what has been done in this connection:
New Brunswick has not amended its game laws to comply with the treaty, but has repealed all its laws protecting migratory birds, on the ground that that is a duty now devolving on the Dominion.
Prince Edward Island has not amended its laws to comply with the treaty, and has no warden service.
Nova Scotia has amended its game laws, but it has omitted protection for wild beasts and ducks-except black, wood and eider-

an'd the open season for Wilson snipe and woodcock does not meet the conditions of the treaty. Moreover, Nova Sootia say they have not an adequate warden service to enforce the Act.
That being the condition of affairs in the Maritime Provinces, it becomes necessary for the Dominion, having regard to its obligations under the treaty, so to amend its Act as to enable it to enforce the law in those provinces. We must take power, therefore, to pass regulations covering minor matters of enforcement to enable us to carry out the law-it having been originally intended that these minor matters should be taken care of, as before, by the provincial authorities. That is the reason for paragraph (aa) in section 1, as to power of regulation under section 4 of the present Act. The same reasoning applies to the Bill throughout. Section 2 provides for penalties for violation and for the bringing of the goods seized to a justice of the peace who has power to order confiscation. The last clause, to which the leader of the Opposition advances his general objection, is also made necessary by the very same cause.
The laws of the various provinces which are now enforcing the Migratory Birds Convention Act, provide for the allocation of the fines. The provincial governments appoint wardens and game officers who a/re not under salary, but who are entitled, where they secure a conviction, to divide the fines, and in that way the enforcement of the law is secured. As, however, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island refuse to enforce the law-and this applies especially to Nova Scotia; the others refuse chiefly to pass laws-we must provide for some division of the fines as well, in order that a system of enforcement may be put into effect, without the necessity of our employing salaried officers for the purpose. That is the reason of this section. The hon. member will find that in his own province this very same law is in effect by provincial legislation. I read from section 108 of the Nova Scotia Game Act:
Every fine imposed and collected under the authority of this Act, shall be paid in full to the Chief Game Commissioner, who shall, except as elsewhere in this section provided, pay over the same to the Provincial Treasurer to be paid and applied to him as provided by section 104 of this Act.
(2)	When a complaint is laid and the information therefor furnished by a person other than a warden, the Chief Game Commissioner may pay one-half of the fine so collected to the complainant.
(3)	When the complaint is laid by a warden
under information therefor furnished by any other person, the Chief Game Commissioner may pay one-quarter of the fine so collected to such informant.	. i
So that the principle of the Nova Scotia' statute is merely being embodied in this. Bill to enable us to carry out the enforcement which apparently the province of Nova Scotia declines to carry out.

Major-General MEWBURN:	At present
the problem of demobilization, not only bringing troops back, but clearing up all records, documents, etc., is an enormous one.
For instance, at the present time some one hundred and seventy thousand ledger sheets have been returned from overseas within the last few weeks-that is, ledger sheets of the individual troops that are *coming over as the men are demobilized. The work of checking and dealing with every individual man's' account is enormous. In addition, there are some five hundred tons of files being gradually returned from overseas to the Militia Departr ment here. That includes all the records *and documents that have been moved from General Headquarters in France back to JSngland, and the records and documents from the various Record Offices in England. It takes an enormous amount of labour and some staff to complete and get all these documents into shape. Furthermore, there is the file containing documents of every individual man with the Canadian Expeditionary Force, amounting in all to over six hundred thousand files. These documents, containing the medical history of every man, it is most essential should be carefully kept so as to protect this country in the matter of claims for pensions in the future. The Pension Department requires these files, also the Department of 'Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment-when the men are discharged, which work has nothing to do with [Major-General Mewbum.]
the Militia Department-and the Land Settlement Board in connection with soldiers' settlement. Then there is the large problem of hospitalization. We are taking care of the returned soldiers-officers, noncommissioned officers, and men-in the various hospitals throughout Canada, and we estimate that by next February we should be through with the military hospitalization, but that is only an estimate. In November, 1918, the casualties of Canadian corps were something like 45,000. The difficult problem was to estimate the number of casualties or invalids coming back to Canada. We estimated, as well as we could, on information from the medical service, that somewhere about May there would be approximately 18,000 invalids still coming back from overseas. I am glad to say that we were generous on our estimate; that the patients in the military hospitals in England are being evacuated a little quicker than we expected and becoming convalescent cases. The last figures from France, I think, showed that there were about seventeen hundred still to be evacuated from that country. The total number of patients in England and France up to a week ago was slightly under 14,000, but many of these-

JULIEN.,,,"I think I can give my hon. friend the information that he desires to-night as to the necessity of the constitution of credits for foreign export business for Canada, and as to the manner in which that business is placed- Before doing so, however, I think I should refer to the speech of the hon. member for Lunenburg.
He covered a very wide field. I had no notice that he would bring forward the matters he dealt with to-night. It would seem to me that they would ordinarily be brought forward when the Minister of Naval Affairs had his estimates before the Committee, but the hon. member was quite in order, because we were discussing the naval estimates for the coming year as embodied in this vote. This Bill which is now before the Committee is analogous to the Bills of last year and the previous year, only that the amount is smaller and its purpose is, as hon. members know, to provide for what we might call the remainder of our war expenditure, and particularly, as the war is in reality although not officially, over, for our demobilization expenditure and other outlays arising out of the war. The Minister of Militia has explained that so far as his portion of the vote is concerned, it is solely for demobilization purposes. I would suggest to my hon. friend the leader of the Opposition that as the Minister of Naval Affairs will be having his estimates before the House to-morrow or the next day,

he might deal with the statements made by the hon. member for Lunenburg on that occasion. I would submit that delay in answering the hon. member, because the minister had no notice that these matters would be brought up to-night, is not a sufficient reason for our not passing the section of the Bill referred to.
With regard to the general question of credits, let me make a rather comprehensive statement. I should like to say, first, that there is no man in the Dominion who would rather see a return to the former and normal modes of business than I. The furnishing of credits by the Dominion of Canada for the purchase of our agricultural and manufactured products is absolutely forced upon us by the exigencies of the financial situation due to the war. Take the question of our grain; I shall come to the manufactured products later. This year I had expected to have to provide a sum not exceeding $100,000,000, for the purchase of our exportable surplus of wheat and flour, but on account of the exchange situation between Great Britain and this continent by which it is impossible for Great Britain to purchase wheat in the United States and' Canada except from funds provided on this side of the Atlantic, and because no funds are available except such as we can provide in Canada, the Dominion Government has paid out up to date a sum in excess of $80,000,000, which has been loaned to the Imperial Government for the purchase ot our wheat, and it has undertaken to furnish a further $90,000,000 which will be required for the purchase of the balance of the wheat and flour products of this last year's crop. My hon. friend, I am sure, would not describe that as a bribe to the farmers. If the Dominion Government did not furnish that credit of $170,000,000-I hope it may be somewhat less, because it is a very heavy burden-then it would mean that the exportable surplus of the wheat of Canada and our exportable surplus of flour could not be bought. Under the old conditions, my hon. friend knows that the Government would not have to intervene at all, and I should be perfectly delighted if the old conditions prevailed, so that the sellers of wheat and flour would simply send forward bills of exchange with the documents attached and get their money in New York exchange. If they were able to do that there would not be to-day a 3 per cent rate of exchange against Canada as between us and the United States. So much for wheat and flour. My hon. friend would not say that we were bribing the

farmers and that we were doing, anything a government should not do at a time like this, in furnishing money which alone makes it possible for the Canadian farmer and the Canadian miller to sell their wheat and flour, and for the rest of the people of Canada to get the benefit that comes to them from the sale of those commodities.
Then as to manufactured goods. I am sure my hon. friend will not object if I ask the Committee to consider the situation with which we were confronted immediately upon the conclusion of the armistice in November last. It has often been said that preventive ability is never appreciated. People see results, but they are not aware of the cause. I have no hesitation in saying that if the Dominion Government had not faced with financial courage the situation which confronted us in November last, we should have a very grave and serious situation in Canada to-day. I believe there would have been thousands if not tens of thousands of people out of work, and I would not like to state what might have happened in Canada in consequence. If my hon. friend will go back to November last, he will realize that the entire community was greatly excited over what would happen once the war came to an end and all our war industries ceased. Directly and indirectly there were 200,000 people, men and women, engaged in munitions work and in the supply of other war material, and in other enterprises connected with those industries and in industries basic to them. That was the situation with which the Government was confronted. We had to find not only the credits with which our wheat and flour, our cheese and meat products were to be purchased, but we also had to face that very acute industrial situation which caused the utmost anxiety to the labouring population in Canada and to business generally, and to all the people interested in the welfare of the country and in the preservation of order in the community. Faced with that situation, and knowing the international financial conditions to which I have referred, the Government, at the instance of the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden), appointed an Overseas War Mission headed by Mr. Lloyd Harris, who did such successful work as head of the British War Mission at Washington in obtaining orders for Canada, and whose work was referred to by the President of the Privy Council in connection with his estimates the other evening. The Prime Minister went overseas himself, and accompanying him were Mr. Lloyd Harris, Mr. Frank Jones, Dr. Robertson, formerly of the Department of Agriculture, and Mr. Draper. The three important national interests, mercantile, labour, and agriculture, were represented.
Those men have been working over there most assiduously since November last, and I am surprised now to hear the hon. member for Maisonneuve ('Mr. Lemieux), although he paid the absent Minister of Trade and Commerce a compliment on the personal side, find fault with the minister whose work, to my knowledge, and on the reports which I have received from men who have been over there, ihas been of the most efficient kind for the benefit of Canada. The Minister of Trade and Commerce has really done admirable work in connection with the important question of finding markets for Canada's grain and meat products and other supplies, and the representatives of the Western Grain Growers and the Western Grain Exchange, ,who went overseas last fall, paid the highest tribute to the work done by him in connection with the important matters in which they were interested.
The Prime Minister has given the closest attention to the subject of the promotion of Canada's trade overseas. I have been in constant cable communication with him, and hundreds of cables have passed relating to matters of shipping, and to the general trade of Canada and its extension to Europe at this time. The purpose of the' Prime Minister in constituting that commission to London was to obtain business for Canada, and to take up the slack of the factory production which was interrupted by the cessation of the war. Hon. gentlemen can picture to themselves what effect the closing of these munition plants, on the scale that we had them in Canada, and of the allied industries immediately affected, would have, and what the result would be, unless we could replace that business by an equal, or at all events a large, volume of export trade. Remember we were manufacturing what we needed for ourselves and our productive capacity for munitions and war supplies bore relation to our export trade. Therefore, unless we could substitute export trade for what we had here, only one result could ensue, and that was that our industries could only run on partial capacity, and that tens of thousands of men would be out of work all over Canada. Mr, Lloyd Harris, as head of the Canadian Mission in London, has not only been doing his utmost to obtain trade for Canada, but has from the very first urged and insisted that Canadian industries

should send their own representatives over there in order that they might not only assist him, and have the benefit of the cooperation of himself and his office, but at the same time push to the utmost for business themselves; and I understand that some two hundred representatives of practically all the industries of Canada are in London to-day on the summons of Mr. Lloyd Harris, and working in co-operation with him for the benefit of our export trade. I think it is a mistake to say that that export trade is for the benefit of a few manufacturers; it seems to me .that it is not a fair statement of the situation. We often play politics in this House, but is it a fair statement to say that the promotion of the export trade of Canada is for the benefit of a few manufacturers? There are hundreds of millions of dollars-

JULIEN.,,,"I will come to that in a moment. I make no objection to my hon. friend raising the question, because I am the last one to deny information on public affairs. This is an important Bill, and I desire to satisfy my hon. friend by making a very full statement: There are hundreds of millions of dollars invested [DOT] in important manufacturing establishments in this country. They employ hundreds of thousands of men whose families are maintained by their wages, and they in turn by the expenditure of their money , promote the business of the country. So that the getting of export trade for Canada for our manufactured goods, as well as for our grain and natural products, is not for the benefit of a few manufacturers, but for the welfare of the people of Canada as a whole. If, as .1 said before, we did not push for that trade, and if we did not get trade of that character for Canada, we should have a very grave situation on our hands to-day.
Now we come to the question of the credits which we shall extend. In the first place- and hon. gentlemen opposite I take it assent to that-we shall have to continue to make extensive loans to Great Britain for the purchase of our foodstuffs and the timber and other products which Great Britain will want from this country. In case some hon. gentlemen may not understand the situation, let me say that the burden on us this year is going to be very heavy because we are demobilizing in Canada, and con-

sequently. we have a higher expenditure in respect of our men coming upon the Treasury here than we would have if those men were overseas, and we were borrowing money from Great Britain for their maintenance in the Old Country and in France, and setting off that expenditure against the advances which we make to 'Great Britain here. I have explained that with respect to last year's wheat crop, we have found, or undertaken to find, no less a sum than $170,000,000, and I have no doubt that with regard to foodstuffs we shall have to make further advances to Great Britain, although I am glad to say that free markets are being established as quickly as possible with respect to all our commodities. Now we have the wheat crop of this year coming on, which we hope will be a large crop, and I do not know to what extent Europe will have to rely on us for credits for the purchase of that. But no matter what we have, we certainly must, and will, ensure the financing of the exportable surplus of the wheat crop of Canada for this year. My own view is that that should be the first demand to be satisfied, it is of such great importance to the entire country. Now we come to these other credits. There was common talk here in November of last year that Canada should strongly push for a portion of the re-construction business in Belgium, France and other devastated countries of Europe. Europe must be restored. Not only will food be required to maintain the population, but raw material and partly manufactured, and manufactured goods of various kinds, in which Canada can compete I think with any other nation, will be required on a vast scale. Now I submit that if the Government had not taken the step which it did in establishing the War Mission and providing credits, hon. gentlemen opposite, headed by my good friend the leader of the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie) would to-night be most severely censuring the Government for not having done precisely what the Government has done. They would have very much better reason for censure in that case, because the conditions in this country, if we had not done what we did, would have been so serious that Opposition criticism would have counted very much more than it does now. Now I beg my friend the leader of the Opposition to take my word for it that we are not doing anything on the other side in the way of financing that we can avoid doing if we are to get the business.

Mr.'A. K. MACLEAN: On the first reading of the Bill the object of this clause was explained very fully. The change proposed is cbnsequent upon the recommendation of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures to secure what is expected to be a more accurate definition of the French foot. So far as Canada is concerned, the French foot is employed only in the province of Quebec, and in connection with land surveys. The French foot as at present defined contains 12-79 inches, and the correction only amounts to -001.

argue this matter from the standpoint of common sense.

I take the view that they are committing a moral offence, at all events, when they live together after discovering that they are not legally married. If they continue to live together they are committing an offence even if they do not go to a hotel
and register. The leader of the Opposition has expressed the case exactly when he says that the passing of this amendment will be equivalent to this House countenancing the living together of people who have no right to do so. To take the case mentioned by my hon. friend of the English girl marrying the soldier in good faith. What course should she take on ascertaining the facts? I think she should leave him at once, and the fact that she may decide to continue living with him does not excuse either of them if they gc to a hotel and register. There ought to be a law on the statute-books, if there is not, making it a criminal offence for people to live together who are not married.

(Mr. Lemieux.]
because he deserves it-or to promote him tp some other department and appoint in his stead some ""live wire"" so that Canada shall secure some of the world's trade in the coming peace times.
I said a moment ago that this legislation is a camdufiaged Budget, and it is. In connection with this third purpose ""the promoting of trade and industry, and transportation facilities therefor"" the Minister of Finance owes the country an outline of the fiscal policy of the Government. Does he believe that trade and commerce and industry can be promoted if the country is kept in ignorance of the tariff changes that are to be made? Surely not. My hon. friend must know the sentiment of his followers. To use a somewhat vulgar expression, which is nevertheless in common parlance, he is between the devil and the deep sea-between the high protectionists on the one hand and the free traders of his party on the other-and he is simply marking time, awaiting the return of the Prime Minister or some heavenly inspiration. I am afraid, however, that his inspiration will come from the opposite direction-
The fourth purpose is this: ""The carrying out of any measures deemed necessary or advisable by the Governor in Council in consequence of the war."" Mr. Chairman, I am afraid of that purpose. I am not timid; I have some courage left in my bones, but I must confess I am really in dread of that fourth purpose. What are those measures that are deemed necessary? What are those vague measures that are deemed advisable? Should not those measures be made known to Parliament, and not left to the sweet will of the Governor in Council? Already the practice of governing by Order in Council has been too much abused, and I am really in dread of what may happen when my hon. friend is granted the powers he is seeking under this fourth purpose.
The fifth purpose is this:	""Payments
made on expenditure incurred during the fiscal year ending the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and nineteen, for the purposes mentioned in the War Appropriation Act, 1918, and in excess of the amount authorized by the said Act."" It is true that my hon- friend gave the House the other day row after row of figures running into the millions-indeed into the hundreds of millions of dollars. We must face the situation; the millions are there. As Mt. Thiers, the liberator of the French territory, once said, referring in the House of Representatives in France to the inevi-

table expenditure of several millions: ""Sa-luez, Messieurs, vous ne les reverrez plus."" After having seen my hon. friend marshalling his long array of millions the other diay I also am inclined to repeat with Thiers, ""Hats off, gentlemen; you shall never see those millions again."" To be serious, I think my hon. friend should take us into his confidence a little more. Assuredly, I am not asking him to give us the inner secrets of his soul; I am not asking him to unbosom before this House, because it would be a terrible confession and I am afraid there would be no absolution for the many crimes he is guiilty of. But at least he should pay the taxpayers of Canada the compliment of telling them why this enormous sum of money is needed, and to w'hat specific purposes it is to be applied. I am afraid of being accused by my hon. friend of obstruction. I will say no more, but I again appeal to him to be a little clearer as to numbers 3 and 4, and to my hon. friend the Minister of Militia and also the Minister of Naval Affairs I would suggest that we might have an outline for the benefit of the country of their respective policies.
Major-General MEWBURN: I have listened with considerable interest to the hon. gentleman's eloquence, but I am at a loss to understand several of the statements he has made. If he will turn to Hansard of April 29th, when I had my main estimates for the Militia Department before the Committee, he will see that he was very complimentary to me on that occasion when I attempted to give a brief resume of the future policy of the militia forces -of Canada. The portion of the Bill now before the Committee does not include one item for the upkeep of the military forces of Canada after demobilization. My hon. friend will see that on page 1404 of unrevised Hansard, April 10, the Acting Prime Minister gave complete details of expenditure, particularly of the militia forces of Canada in connection with this Bill. I am sure my hon. friend is as anxious now, as he always has been, to assist in every way the prosecution of the war by paying for our soldiers overseas. I do not believe for a moment that he means now to leave those soldiers alone and not consider the complete demobilization of the troops. Every dollar of this expenditure is simply to pay the allowances of soldiers on active -service to-day, including war service gratuity; deferred pay, which amounts to some $36,000,000, which is money belonging to the troops, held back in the w'is-dom of the Government, and now being paid them on discharge, plus
interest; also assigned pay some $11,000,000; separation allowance to dependents of the troops; and subsequent items including transportation and feeding of troops until complete demobilization. Therefore, no portion of the money included in this Bill is to be utilized for the upkeep of military forces beyond the period of complete demobilization, which I am just as anxious as any one else to see carried out as early as possible.
Regarding the future policy as far as the militia is concerned. I regret that my colleague the Admiral of the Fleet (Mr. Ballantyne) is not here to give an account of the Navy, but I explained the other night as to the future policy of the military forces, that, after very careful consideration, we appointed an inter-departmental committee to consider ways and means for reorganization. The Chairman of the Committee is General Otter, who has had a very large experience in the militia of Canada; and it is also proposed to have an officer who has had distinguished service at the front-, one from the permanent force, one from the active militia, and one who has never been associated with the militia until this war. The Committee are to visit the various military districts, to consider ways and means and probably at another session of the House to bring in some concrete proposal as to how far the militia should go. The duty of the committee is to consider and report how best to give effect to the proposal that with a view to preserving their traditions and identities, the several units of the C. E. P. which have served at the front should be incorporated in the Canadian Militia-this without avoidable increase of establishments, without prejudice to the divisional system of organization, and with due regard to the services which at various times, both before and during the war, the militia itself has rendered. That is practically the substance of tlie duties of the committee. The present idea is to endeavour to rehabilitate the militia units as well as possible. The permanent corps had a strength prior to the war of 3,000, kept up during the war for service overseas by reinforcements. Those men who come back are entitled to discharge or to go on pension. It is proposed to increase that permanent force as a temporary measure to 5,000 men throughout Canada. That will be practically all the force in Canada, and will be held in aid of the civil power if necessary. At the present time it is not proposed to train the militia which is in a disorganized state. Possibly it may

be considered necessary to train a portion of the militia next fall, but no definite policy has been arrived at and il think it would be premature for us to lay down a concrete military policy just at present.

Acting Prime Minister to say that the accounts standing between Canada and the Imperial Government show two hundred million dollars to Canada's credit?
Sir' THOMAS WHITE: Yes.
Mr. 'CAHILL:	I object to the portion
of the clause with reference to promoting trade and industry. I understand that something like $25,000,000 is to be loaned to Rumania. Rumania is at war with Austria-Hungary at present and her credit may not be too good. Peace has not yet been signed and it is doubtful what countries will sign the treaty. I am opposed to the principle of lending the money of the people of Canada to the manufacturers of this country, for that is practically what this amounts to. There is an offer to Rumania, an offer to Serbia and I think to other countries to lend from $25,000,000 upwards, and the question arises in the first place as to the advisability of Canada going into the business of loaning money to the factories of this country to promote trade where they are not able to go out and get trade themselves. It is a fallacy to suppose that you can promote the trade of the country by furnishing credits to other countries to buy our goods. The trade of the country is done with trade; it is a trade arrangement. We are not going to sell Rumania rwheat, live stock, butter or eggs. We are not going to sell Rumania directly anything from the farm, but we are going to sell to that country manufactured goods; we are going to sell Serbia manufactured goods, and to any of the countries, apart from Great Britain, that get a loan from this Government will be sold manufactured goods. Great Britain can float a loan here at any timej and if Rumania wants a loan here she should be able to float one on whatever terms are possible.

But certainly she should not be able to come to the Government of Canada and float her debentures here .at par and take in exchange manufactured goods from this country. Canada to-day is indebted to Great Britain and to the United States. There is a heavy balance of trade against us, and we are in debt to various countries. Yet in the face of that we are going out to borrow more money from the Canadian people, or the British or American people to loan to another country. In other words, we are giving credit to doubtful customers at the expense of the people to whom we owe money to-day, with the result that we are only sinking deeper all the time. The manufacturers tell us they must have protection in order to cope in Canada with outside competition. Then they come back and tell us that they are not able to compete in the outside markets unless we supply them money to buy the goods. It can easily be seen where we are going to end if we attempt to furnish capital to the manufacturers to buy goods to ship out to all the [DOT] countries that are practically bankrupt in order to make trade for our factories. The argument was used, when the resolution upon which this Bill is based was before the House, that we must keep the factories going in order to create employment for labour. If the Government were to say: We will furnish this credit on the condition that all the profits that are made in these factories shall go to the employees and not to the manufacturers-then I would consider the proposal as being more sane and more justifiable. But to allow the owners of factories to fix their own prices for the goods, and their own price for labour, and then come to the Dominion Treasury for the money to carry that out, is, I think, a great mistake. If Rumania is not able to pay, what is the alternative? What are we going to do when this $25,000,000 becomes due? We must increase our taxation to pay the interest on that loan; and when our Western friends are asking for reductions in the tariff, or for the adoption of free trade, they will be met with the statement: Our responsibilities are so great that we cannot reduce or abandon the tariff. We are virtually bonusing these factories, causing a greater public debt, going out to incur what are practically certain losses that will entail increased taxation on our people. The Government is not only going to pay out this money to the manufacturers of Canada, but it is shovelling the money out to some foreign country; and the people of the Dominion 
will be called upon to pay. Should the loans not be liquidated, we will have to continue to pay the interest on these loans ourselves, and that will simply mean increasing the burden of taxation. I do not believe it is the duty of this Government to furnish any special industry or any special class of people with money to carry on business. If the Government has too much money on hand it would be better for it to purchase land from those who are keeping it out of use and sell it or give it to the returned soldiers, or to these factory employees, to build homes for themselves, rather than to hand it to some foreign country that in all probability will never be able to make repayment.
Mr. H. iH. STEVENS: The argument of my hon. friend is a most extraordinary one to my mind. He states that we owe Great Britain, the United States,- and other countries certain debts, and he deplores the fact. I wonder how in the name of common sense he expects this country is going to pay its indebtedness to Great Britain, or to any other country, except by the exportation of goods. Surely he must be aware that Rumania also owes Great Britain very large sums of money, if we send goods to Rumania and finance them in Canada we are simply going that far towards the liquidation of our debt to Great Britain. Being a man of very high intelligence the hon. gentleman must know that as a rule goods are not exactly paid for in cash to the country from which they are bought. It may be Spain, or Portugal, or France, or Great Britain, that is sending us goods; we also send goods to those countries; and the final outcome is a settlement by the process of exchange. He objects strongly to this Government establishing a credit for Rumania k* buy manufactured goods in Canada. If he is sincere he must just as strongly object to the Canadian Government establishing a credit for Great Britain or any other country-

other classes of goods. Of course I understand that my hon. friend will say, for the sake of his farmer constituents, that he does not object to financing the exportation of farm products, but he does object to-financing the exportation of manufactured goods. It is this everlasting baiting of the manufacturer, or other industrial person or company, that is causing sectional discord in Canada. This country is going to prosper, not merely by building up the agri-

cultural industry-which I am interested in and most anxious to see built up-but also by building up the manufacturing and the industrial interests. Canada does not possess merely agricultural resources; it has other immense resources-minerals, timber, oil, fish, and innumerable others; -and if we are going to liquidate the future debt of Canada it will be by the development of these resources and by encouraging the manufacturer. An ordinary business concern cannot ship goods to the centre of Europe with the expectation of securing an adjustment in the ordinary banking way. That is clearly impossible, and has been impossible for months and for years but through the agency of the British Government and through the medium of our own Government and the usual governmental channels and avenues, we are enabled to establish a credit for this country, and thus to send our goods out and secure payment to our manufacturers. This is not a bonus. My hon. friend is absolutely misleading and wrong when he tries to imply that we are giving a bonus to the manufacturers; we are simply establishing a credit to enable our trade to go on.
I think there is one principle that this House should get clearly into its mind, and get there just as quickly as possible, and it is this: If we are to meet in the next few years the enormous burden that Canada has incurred we must meet it through the process of foreign trade, through the exportation, not only of agricultural products, but of every class of goods manufactured from our natural resources. Unless we do seize upon that as an elementary principle in our economics, and bend every effort to direct the policy of Canada towards the development of our resources, I fear for the future of the country. I give the Acting Prime Minister and his colleagues the greatest credit for the courageous manner in which they are grappling with this problem, and providing for a medium of exchange, for a credit, for these foreign countries-especially for the enormous credits supplied by the Minister of Finance during the last four or five years for Great Britain, and for our Allies overseas, and I would say the more the Government can arrange these credits the better it will be for this country and the sooner we will certainly be able to liquidate our public debt, and relieve ourselves from some of the burdens which are bearing so heavily upon us.

In my opinion we are passing holus bolus a part of the Budget which is to be brought down some time during this month, if I mistake not, by the Minister of Finance.
We are anticipating and voting piecemeal what should be presented in bulk by the hon. gentlemen. If it were a small amount I would not object so much, because I understand there are pressing needs at times which require speedy and special legislation; but here my hon. friend demands that a sum not exceeding $350,000,000 be raised, and he is surprised perhaps that we offer some objection-not obstruction- to his large appetite for money. The preamble of the Bill does not in my judgment give a clear view of the situation. It seems to me an anomaly that on the very day the Peace Terms are announced to this House by the President of the Privy Council my hon. friend should preface his Bill with these words:
Whereas notwithstanding the armistice of the eleventh day of November last, and tjie extension thereof which has been granted by His Majesty and His Allies, has suspended the actual operations of the war between His Majesty and the German Emperor, the Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary, the Sultan of Turkey, and the King of the Bulgarians, it - is necessary that measures should continue to be taken for the common defence and security;
Shall my hon. friend for any longer period after the present eventful one come before Parliament and, always under the pretext of winning the war, ask for the speedy voting of such large sums of money?
I hope not,
My hon. friend enumerates in section 2 the purposes of this legislation. Among the purposes mentioned I find:	"" (a) the defence and security of Canada."" I am inclined to believe that this language does not convey quite the whole truth. The defence and security of Canada has never been so well provided for as at present. We have a laTge standing army, and our defence and security does not require, it seems to me, any large expenditure, if we have reached the millennium that has been sought for during so many centuries-that of permanent peace. The hon. Minister of Finance does not specify the amounts that are to be voted for each of the purposes enumerated, and consequently he does not say what amount out of this $350,000,000 will be applied to the defence and security of Canada.
Canada has during this great war done wonderfully well. She has raised, equipped and sent 500,000 men overseas, an array well

worthy of any great nation. But this was for the specific purpose of winning the war against autocracy. The nightmare is now over, the German Emperor and his allies have been thoroughly defeated. The people of this country made enormous sacrifices to maintain the honour and reputation of Canada. But, eager as they were to do their duty fearlessly and without questioning the heavy expenditure which was necessary, they are not in a mood-and I say it without any equivocation-to spend in the future, one quarter of the amount that has been spent annually during the last fateful four years. There is a general cry throughout the country that we should cut out the frills in the Department of Militia and Defence, that we should reduce mercilessly its expenditure and come back to normal. I hope that my statement will not be considered as anti-Canadian or anti-preparedness. I am simply voicing the feeling of the people in this matter. Before voting the amount asked for by this legislation, out of regard for the people and for Parliament, my hon. friend the Minister of Militia and Defence should give us an outline of his peace-time policy. Hitherto all appropriations have been voted liberally and willingly in view of war times; but now we have reached peace times, and in this connection the Minister of Militia, in whose integrity and honesty of purpose I have the fullest confidence, should give to the country at the earliest moment his policy with regard to the organization of the defence and security of Canada during normal times.
With the second purpose of the Bill, ""the conduct of naval and military operations in or beyond Canada and the demobilization of the Canadian forces,"" I am partly in agreement. Any money which is needed for the demobilization of our Canadian forces I am ready to grant immediately. But here again I require some assistance from both the Minister of Militia and the Minister of Naval Affairs. In mentioning the question of the defence and security of Canada in peace times, I had in mind our military organization on land-our military forces- But here reference is made to naval operations. I do not wish to re-open the naval debate, but might I not say here that the success attending the naval operations of Canada during this war-and those operations were successful, because our coasts were well guarded-was due entirely to the wise policy propounded by the late lamented leader of the Liberal party? Sir, what happened in 1911? The Liberal Gov-

ernment had passed legislation with a view to creating a naval force for Canada. That policy was combatted from two different angles. It was combatted in my own native province, because, forsooth, the defence of Canada by Canadian ships manned by Canadian officers and Canadian bluejackets was nothing less than suicidal. Canada, in the words of the opponents of that policy, was entering into the vortex of European militarism. That campaign carried some weight in the province from which I come. In Ontario the policy of a Canadian navy was combatted because, forsooth, it was too much of a Canadian policy and not sufficiently a British policy. 1 shall not refute both arguments at this moment, but I will say this: The Government that preceded this one came to office pledged at the first opportunity to remove from the Statute Book the blemish which the naval policy of the Liberal party was supposed to have placed upon it. But nothing of the kind was done- In 1914, when war was declared, the then Government was only too ready to use the much decried ""tin-pot navy"" of the Laurier Government, and Canada owes the protection of our coasts-of the Atlantic coast, at least-chiefly to the much abused Niobe and Rainbow. Subsequently the Naval Department, which had been organized under that policy, was reinforced and developed according to the provisions of that Naval Bill. It is a matter of pride for me, after so many years -eight years have elapsed since that campaign of 1911-to proclaim that, after all, Sir Wilfrid Laurier was right when he propounded that policy-a policy which, we must not forget, had been approved by the Imperial Conference of 1911 and accepted by the British Admiralty.

My hon. friend will find that statement in Hansard of this session, unrevised edition, beginning at page 1404. I do not regard it as at all necessary that the consideration of this Bill should await the bringing down of the Budget. The Budget statement deals with the expenditures for the past year and estimates the expenditure for the coming year; shows the amount of revenue received during the past year and indicates the amount which it is expected will be received for the fiscal year in which it is delivered, together with the proposals of the Government for additional taxation to meet the requirements as disclosed. I informed the hon- member for Chateauguay-Huntingdon (Mr. Robb) that

I would give him as accurate a statement as I could of the war debt incurred up to the end of the last fiscal year.
I indicated then that I thought it inadvisable that I should make, so to speak, .two Budget statements, and I think the House will concur in the propriety of that view. It is my intention when the Budget is brought down to make as comprehensive and accurate a statement as I can with respect to the cost of the war to Canada to the end of the last fiscal year, together with an estimate, as nearly as it can be made, of the remaining expenditures which we shall have to make under the authority of this Bill for demobilization, including war gratuities and other expenditures arising out of the war, so that the House may have before it on the occasion of the Budget, as accurate a statement as possible of the total cost of the war to Canada from the beginning to the time when our accounts are practically closed out, with regard to the principle of war expenditure. There will, of course, remain the annual burden necessitated by our war debt and pensions, but I can assure my hon. friend that in the Budget I shall amplify the statement to the fullest extent with the view of disclosing to the House all the information in the possession of the Government respecting the matters which I have mentioned. While I stated that to the hon. member for Chateauguay-Huntingdon, I also said that I would endeavour to give him the figures, so far as available, to the end of the last fiscal year in a very brief statement, which I shall now place upon Hansard:

I stated the other day that our account with the Imperial Government showed a difference of over two hundred million dollars to the credit of Canada. I think that statement is all that I can give, or should be called upon to give, at the present time, in view of my intention, as expressed to the Committee, with respect to the Budget. If my hon. friend will turn to page 1404 of unrevised Hansard he will find the details of
expenditures for the past year. They are necessarily incomplete because many expenditures have not yet been brought into account. 'My hon. friend is aware that many services are not brought into account of the books for some time after the end of March, and especially is that so in connection with war expenditures. On page 1405 he will find all the different items of our estimated war expenditure for the coming year, with some notes which may be useful in their consideration. The Minister of Militia is here to-night because a great part of bhe estimated expenditure for the year belongs to bis department here and overseas.

JULIEN.,,,"The minister was kind enough to direct his observations very largely to myself. He has not in any way cleared his Government from the responsibility of starting this new venture of opening credits in a foreign country with .which we never did any business before. We have done our share in connection with the war nobly and well, particularly as an ally of our Mother Country, and nobody is finding very much fault with any moneys that have been expended in that direction. But I say to the Acting Prime Minister that we are under no obligation to build up Rumania or any other country that might have of its own free will gone into the war and received some damage by reason of that fact. It is going too far to ask the Canadian people, who have not the money ,to spend, who have to borrow money for their own purposes, who cannot, by reason of the high cost of living and other matters, get all the money they require for their own purposes, to furnish this money; and the Acting Prime Minister is going too far in looking for sympathy and applause from his supporters to-night by saying that we are doing this in the generosity of our hearts and extreme loyalty in order to build up the finances df Rumania, because that country got into trouble with its neighbours and not because- of any loyalty to us.

I have no fault to find with advancing credits to Great Britain, France, Italy or Belgium because, if the Acting Prime Minister had the securities of those
12 p.m countries in his vault, he could easily raise money on them from	any	hank in this countryor in the United States. But the trade	that	we	went	after,	by and
through our Trade Mission, was the trade of a country whose securities are evidently not very good in this country, upon which securities the Acting Prime Minister cannot raise any money and which, as the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) stated, are being peddled about from bucket shop to bucket shop in London at much below par- What we should have done is to deal with Great Britain and France, and if Great Britain and France want to advance goods to those smaller powers who are under their control and who must pay for them or get into trouble, that would be good business. We could very well say to the British Government: We will give you all the credit you want; we will arrange that we send the goods to you, and you can deal with the smaller countries. We never had any dealings with those countries in the most prosperous days of Canada, and why should we now pass over the heads of France, Italy and Great Britain and seek trade with countries with which we have never dealt with before? That is the particular fault I have to find. It is stated that our Trade Mission and our Trade Ministers were so clumsy and slow and incompetent in securing trade that everything that was worth having was gone and they were glad enough at last to fall back on such trade as they could make with Rumania by offering Rumania the money. That is where the difficulty is. If our manufacturers were properly represented on the other side by live business men, they would have secured the orders that the United States manufacturers got, but we did not get them, and our representatives, in order to do something to justify their existence on the other side, had to make this masterful stroke of saying to Rumania: We will give you money if you will be kind enough to buy our goods. That is all they did for which they claim so much credit, and I do not think they have shown any great foresight or capacity because they have done that.
I want to be absolutely fair to the manufacturers. We have manufacturers in the part of the country from which I come, manufacturing rails and all kinds of structural steel. They got no help from the Government.

The corresponding clauses in last year's Act are as follows:

(b)	the conduct of naval and military operations in or beyond' Canada;
(c)	promoting the continuance of trade industry and business communications, whether by means of insurance or indemnity against war risk or otherwise;

Now the Government deemed shipbuilding to be a war measure, and payments were made up to the end of the last fiscal year, and I think have been made since, on that account out of the War Appropriation.

But the so-called facts were as absolutely unfounded as anything could possibly be. I say that because I know the facts- These are the things which bring military affairs into disrepute in this country. So long as the war was on, I never said a word to stop a man from going into the training camps, but since the armistice was signed I have on different occasions written to the officers about certain oases, but have never received the slightest satisfaction. In one case I tried on different occasions by personal request and correspondence to get a married man home because his wife was lying sick in bed. I went down and saw him at St. John. He was performing no military service at all; he was not doing twenty minutes work a day; he had never had any training, and there was no need for any training. After some three or four weeks I had the slight satisfaction of securing five days' leave for him so that he could go home and look after his wife and family. Now this is not reasonable, it is not just,-
The minister may say that it was necessary to have the men there for garrison duty. However that may be, I say it was not necessary to keep a married man there who was required at home to look after -and protect his sick wife and family.

This is entirely new, and if the term "" transportation facilities "" is not to be construed as meaning shipbuilding, I hardly see how we could be called upon to give to the Government the right to facilitate transport and expend any money for that purpose unless the items are brought down in the Estimates of some department. The Acting Prime Minister does not appear to know much more on the subject than I do. This is not for shipbuilding; it is not for the chartering of ships. The demobilization of our troops is covered by other sections, and this is not for carrying war materials back to this country. If it is not for the building of ships, how should we be called upon to vote any money for the payment of transportation of our goods or for bringing into Canada the goods we buy?

But if there was actual overborrowing, meaning something in excess of what you have power to borrow, then clearly that must be deducted from the $350,000,000. However, it is enough to call my hon. friend's attention to it, and his solicitor no doubt will look into it.

future borrowings, the policy should be to borrow for shorter terms. No one can foresee what interest rates will be. My own view is that 'they are not likely to drop materially for a considerable time; I do not see how they can. What I have said is subject to this:	in putting out loans
one has to consider the financing that has already been done and not have his loans in large amounts too close to the present time. Let me illustrate. Suppose the Dominion Government during the war had been fearful of the comparatively high interest rates and had resorted to short-date borrowing, which is all right for comparatively small amounts in times of high interest rates. And suppose the Minister of Finance had to face within the next five years, let us say, the raising of five, seven or ten hundred million dollars; that would be a very serious matter. The amounts expended in this war, the debt of Canada and the debts of all nations, are so vast that funding is not possible as it would be in normal times. One of the advantages of our situation is that our loans are distributed over five, ten, fifteen and twenty years. I know precisely what my hon. friend has in mind-that we shall have to pay high interest rates over a period of fifteen and twenty years. That is true in respect of certain of our loans. But I do not see what advantage it would be to us within the next five or ten years, having regard to the loans we have to meet before ten years are over, to be in a position to recall the other bonds, because the financial operations would not be possible to

enable us to retire them and replace them with further issues at lower rates; it seems to me that the transactions are too great. I do not like, any more than my hon. friends, the idea that the Dominion has to pay that rate of interest over so long a period. But short-date borrowing is almost fatal in war time, because you get accumulations of debt ahead of you and when you need fresh money you are confronted with maturities coming due, and a very serious situation results.

Mr. (Murray:	Is the House to understand
that this proposed change has been arranged without consultation between the two governments?
-Col. Amery: I do not think the House should understand that. Undoubtedly when the matter is advanced to a further stage the Government will be consulted.
As the representative in Washington will have no ambassadorial powers but will act -simply as the Canadian agent, as our agent in Paris or in London acts, may I ask the

cannot agree ' with my hon. friend. Let me give a case in point. An agreement was entered into by the late Government of Canada with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company and it was signed on behalf of the Government.

Similarly, my hon. friend negotiated a treaty at Washington in 1911.	1 understand that was
signed by the hon. tnember (Mr. Fielding) and his colleagues, but it had not legislative effect until considered and approved, and it was not in that case approved by Parliament. I do not understand that the present case is different.
Mr. W. 8. FIELDING: My hon. friend, I submit, is mistaken. There was no treaty signed at Washington; but there was an agreement made which was subject to Parliamentary approval-not ratification; exchange of ratifications is a part of the machinery without which a treaty does not become effective.

I now come to the policy of the Government for the future. I have already stated that we have forty-five ships under contract. There are at th'e present time certain yards in Canada that require business. Berths are becoming vacant, and many more will become vacant in the very near future. The Government has not finally decided how many additional ships they will order but I will bring down in my Supplementary Estimates the amount that the Government will think it wise to ask approval for. The sum of $30,000,000 that I am dealing with now is to complete the contracts that we have already let, but in view of the fact that there is a great demand for ships and also that we could sell some of our ships under contract at the present time if the Government deemed it wise to do so, we are not going to discontinue shipbuilding for the moment. We realize that there are
30,000	men engaged in the shipyards throughout Canada, from Prince Rupert to Halifax, and there are fully 10,000 more engaged in the industry of making engines, boilers, etc., and to cause 40,000 men to be out of employment at this time would be rather a dangerous thing to do. It is therefore not the intention of the 'Government to cease their shipbuilding programme now. We are going to order additional ships, at least to keep the yards that are requiring

work busy throughout the balance of 1919, and probably for a few months in 1920.

While I give him credit for sincerely believing that the statement he made was correct, if I read Hansard aright -I was not in the House at the time-he stated that the Canadian Government ships under contract cost 400 per cent more than* they had any right to cost, the comparison made by the hon. gentleman being between the pre-war price in England of $50 per ton and the prices the 'Canadian Government have made with the various shipyards throughout the country. The correction I wish to make is that the hon. member overlooked stating that his price was a pre-war price. The most reliable information I can get from England, Ireland and Scotland is that all of their yards are busy; that they are building ships rapidly for themselves, and that they are also building a certain number of ships for their Allies in Europe. Consequently, no one can get a firm price for ships over there. If any one in Canada wanted to build a ship of any size and
approached any of the Old Country yards, . he would be told that they would enter into a contract with him on a cost plus basis, but that they could not give him a firm price per ton. He would also be told that they could not make deliveries before at least the spring of 1920. In this connection, I might quote a well known shipbuilder, Sir G. B. Hunter, of the firm of Swan, Hunter, a firm distinguished for its shipbuilding. Sir G. B. Hunter, in an interview which was reported in the Newcastle Journal on April 6, 1919, stated that ships cost at present three times as much to build in England and Scotland as they did before the war. Therefore, if we take the hon. member's figure of $50 per ton, and if we take the well known and reliable authority which I have quoted, namely Sir G. B. Hunter, ships built in the United Kingdom at the present time would cost $150 per ton.

There is no protection whatever given to the shipbuilders in the way of duty and bonus, and when the yards of the United Kingdom are free a year and a half hence to take Orders, it will be most difficult for the Canadian shipbuilder to compete unless some form of assistance is given by the Government. What that form of assistance will be has not yet been determined, but between now and the next session of the House we hope to have a policy ready to present to Parliament.

The Deputy Minister of Marine and Fisheries, Mr. Johnston, and the Deputy Minister of Trade and Commerce, Mr. O'Hara, will consult as often as necessary with the general manager of the Government ships in regard to what cargoes should be moved because there is more cargo available than the Government has ships to carry.

These ships are being built in order that the people of Canada and the Government may control the freight from the time that it leaves the port from which it is shipped to the time it reaches its destination in Canada, and they will carry export cargoes from mine, field, and forest, and from our industries here. The United States Government have put a ban on the export of wheat from the ports of Baltimore,New York, and Boston. What would this Government do to carry the wheat of our great western prairies if we had not the ships we had now? I really cannot follow the hon. member's reasoning at all. Cargo ships are built for the very purpose of carrying freight, and the Government shipbuilding programme does not include a passenger service. Whether we shall build passenger ships and have them ply on the Pacific and Atlantic is a subject that has not yet engaged the attention of the Government, but I may say that the ships we have built are modern up-to-date cargo ships, and I do not think they should be referred to as ordinary tramp ships. They are built for the purposes of the trade of Canada and to assist the Canadian National Railways, and I am sure the majority of the members of this House will support the Government policy.

One argument he put up was that Canada should not have a cotton trade, and he advanced cogent reasons why Lancashire occupies her premier position as the centre of the cotton trade. Of course this House knows very well that cotton is not grown in Lancashire; they import it just the same as we do. He cannot therefore argue that we should not have a cotton industry in Canada just the same as they have in Lancashire. They are able to compete in the markets of the world because they have their skilled workmen; and we can do exactly the same thing. We do not grow cotton in Canada, but we have cheaper power, and in the long run the cotton industry in this country will be in just as strong a position as it is in England, and there is just as much reason why we should have a cotton trade as there is that England should have it.
Now, there is nothing so vital before the people in this country at the present moment as this question of trade and shipbuilding. I am in touch with the shipbuilding industry, there being a large shipbuilding yard in my riding; and I am also in touch with foreign trade. This country during the war did not confine itself entirely to the manufacture of munitions. It carried on trade all over the world by ousting German goods in South America, China, Japan, India and other countries. That trade grew to vast proportions, it amounted last year to something like half a billion dollars-that is outside of munitions and foodstuffs-and that is a trade I think we should carry on. That is the

condition that obtained during the war. Previous to the	war	it was	difficult to carry on shipbuilding in Canada on account	of	this	so-called	free
trade. The hon. gentleman who has spoken (Mr. Michael Clark) told the truth in that respect. We had free trade in ships- Ships that were built in Great Britain could come into Canada free, they could go up on the Great Lakes and carry on their trade as long as they were of British registry. There is no necessity of changing our policy in that respect, because protection did not touch that matter at all, and the hon. member for Guys-borough knows that very well. He knows that British ships traded in Canada free. Ships from Great Britain carried on a coasting trade from town to town and from Fort William to the Lake Erie ports freely, and not a cent of tariff was paid by those ships.
Mr. J. H- SINCLAIR: My hon. friend will perhaps admit that the size of our canals afforded some protection, because only a certain class of ships could come in?

I do not profess to be a military or a naval man, I am only ' an ordinary lawyer; but if this document were dealing with ordinary-commercial business, I would have to say that it dates from the signing of the armistice, because hostilities did end on that date. Whether the man who drafted it meant that or not, that is 'the language of the Order. I understand that the contracts that men sign in the infantry contain the expression "" six months after the end of the war."" ""The end of the war"" and ""the cessation of hostilities"" are separate and distinct things. There have been no hostilities since the armistice was signed, and unless there is some peculiar interpretation of naval and military contracts, those men have the right to believe that their six months commenced to run from the 11th of November last and will expire on the 11th of this month. Those men are Canadians and are deserving of our best attention. They are not rebellious. They interpret their contract in a certain way, and it is quite possible that they got the opinion of some legal gentleman in Halifax in regard to it. I would like the minister to take positive action, so that those men will see that they are not treated as if they were nobody, that ""they can mutiny if they like and they will see where they are going to land."" I do not want them to have that idea; I want them to feel that the minister is concerned about their welfare and will see that they are properly treated. If they do hear something from the department before the 11th recognizing their position,
I presume they will be pleased and there will be no trouble; whereas if they are ignored, if nothing is done beyond the stereotyped reply that the minister makes to me across the#floor, we may have another Kin-mel situation on our hands. We do not want anything of that kind; rather we desire our naval as well as the rest of our military operations to end properly, for we may want those men again. That was mentioned in one of the letters addressed to me, that naval and military men may

be required at other critical stages of our national life, and it is well not to leave any stings or heartburnings in connection with their demobilization. I hope such action will be taken that those men will realize that they are treated as Canadians who have rendered good service to their native country and in whom the Government feel a deep interest.

I rose more particularly to refer to the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister last evening as to the accounts of Canada. He gave a very complete account of our war expenditure, but did not give the statement that I more particularly required as to the exact financial position of the country. However, as we are led to believe that the Budget will be brought down shortly, .1 suppose that the Minister of Finance intends to give that statement then.
The Committee is no doubt aware that the vote of $350,000,000 now under consideration represents a sum greater than the total debt of Canada prior to 1914. The Government at this session are asking for enormous credits, and I am not sure that the country fully realizes the magnitude of these credits. The Estimates that have already been brought down provide for an expenditure of $437,000,000 odd; this item is $350,000,000; the level crossing Bill calls for an expenditure of $200,000; highways about $20,000,000, and housing $25,000,000. A total of $832,000,000 is asked for, and we are yet to have Supplementary Estimates, judging from the statements made by the different ministers. Hon. gentlemen on this side of the House do not intend to criticize this vote so far is it relates to defence and demobilization. We have supported during the war all the votes the Government has taken for war purposes.
Last evening as I listened to the Acting Prime Minister I could not help thinking that he was setting up a man of straw for the purpose of knocking him dawn. He was trying to make the country believe that we on this side of the House were not in favour of encouraging the manufacturing industries of this country. The facts are quite to the contrary. The Liberal party has never discouraged the manufacturing industries of this country. In fact, the manufacturers as well as the farmers of this country enjoyed their greatest pros-

perity during the fifteen years of the late Liberal administration. It never was, and is not to-day, the policy of the Liberal party to do anything to injure the manufacturing industries of this country. We wish to help them, and we believe that the best way to help them is by removing certain restrictions which to-day are an incubus upon them, as well as being very harmful to the agricultural interests of this country. We believe that the larger and the wider the market we can obtain for our agricultural products, the better it will be for the manufacturing interests of this country.
Last evening the Acting Prime Minister laid great stress upon the rate of exchange and the adverse trade balance against Canada. I wish to say to him that he and his Government are in some measure responsible for the adverse trade balance against Canada at the present time. I would remind him, so that he may deal with the matter when he brings down his Budget, that his action in connection with the pulp and paper industry in this country did very much to create an adverse trade balance against us. Had he treated properly the pulp and paper industries of this country, had he allowed them greater freedom in exporting their product, it would have been better for Canada and better for that industry. If that had been the policy of the minister, instead of the trade being curtailed, it would have expanded.
Now let me give a case in connection with agricultural products. No later than last fall this Government put an embargo on dairy products going out of this country. They fixed the price on the products of butter and cheese factories. The farmers all along the international line'-the embargo did not apply for the whole length of the international line because deputations came here from Manitoba and Saskatchewan protesting against the embargo -these farmers, when the price of butter and cheese was fixed began to ship their milk and cream to the United States. So the Government put an embargo against dairy products entering the United States. When we buy corn from the United States for our dairy herds, we are ready to pay for it with butter and cheese. Otherwise, we must pay in money. That is another reason why we have an adverse trade balance, and this Government have largely contributed in bringing it about.
The hon. member for Centre Toronto (Mr. Bristol), whose voice I regret we

do not hear oftener in this House, referred to a condition that prevailed on the lower St. Lawrence in connection with some ship at Seven Islands. He made the statement that a mill at Seven Islands had been offered a 10,000-ton ship which they could not use, but that had they been able to get a ship of lesser tonnage they would have been able to avail themselves of it. That reminded me that the Government, who boast that they are trying to do so much for Canadian industry, have again come in and crippled a Canadian industry in Ontario. That story of the Seven Islands brought to my mind the fact that there is at Thorold a very large paper mill, which I understand is controlled by the Chicago Tribune. They manufacture pulp at Seven Islands. This company own their own vessels which for several years have been carrying pulp from Seven Islands to Thorold, and which are under American register. Sometime early this spring the American Lake Shippers' Association convinced their board at Washington that it would be a good thing to cancel the reciprocity in trade that existed between the United States and Canadian vessels on the Upper Lakes, and the Canadian Government retaliated. The result is that boats of Canadian register are not now allowed to trade from one United States port to another, and our Government have brought in regulations preventing boats of United States register from trading between two Canadian ports. This mill is unable to get boats to carry pulp from Seven Islands to the mill at Thorold, and no later than last Saturday a representative of that company, whom I accidentally met at the Chateau Laurier, told me that unless they could obtain vessels somewhere the mills at Thorold were going to be closed down-. This is one example of what our Government are doing to "" assist "" Canadian industry- assist in crippling it. Let that same condition be protracted until the fall, and when we commence moving our grain and wheat crop from the head of the Great Lakes the farmers of Western Canada will be at the mercy of a combine of shipowners in Canada. These shipowners will fix the rates and the western farmer will have to pay the piper. But he will not have much reason to complain because his representatives in this Parliament support a Government that is responsible for these conditions.
Last evening the hon. Acting Prime Minister made much of the important

duties that Mr. Lloyd Harris was discharging-what he had done for Canada at Washington and was now doing at London. I could not help thinking of the position that Mr. Lloyd Harris occupies. Mr. Lloyd Harris, a very good personal friend of mine, left the Liberal party because that party wanted to obtain wider markets and trade with the United States. That was his only reason. Now how can we hope to get extended business for this country when we send as a representative a man who only a few years ago was absolutely opposed to export trade, and whose policy was the home market and only the home market? If my information is correct, we in Canada are suffering from an unfortunate condition of affairs in England. I am making this statement publicly, so that the ministers may interest themselves in it, because the matter to which I am about to refer is common gossip in London, England, and in Canada. The statement is that in London the secretary or some of the officials in the High Commissioner's office and some of the officials in the Trade Commission are not on speaking terms, and that when communications from Canada, intended for certain of these officials in London, go to the other officials, instead of being mailed directly to those in London for whom they are intended, they are sent back to Canada and have to be re-mailed to the proper parties. The sooner that sort of thing is straightened out the better it will be for Canada. These conditions prevail, not amongst the men higher up- I have no fault to find with Sir George Perley or Sir Edward Kemp; they are suffering from the incompetence of understrappers who are running the office over there to the detriment of Canada-and the sooner this Government instruct their representatives over there to get rid of these understrappers who are causing injury to the trade of this country, the better it will be for Canada.
I am sorry I have taken up so much time. I do not intend delaying the passage of this Bill, but there is another matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister so that he may be in a position to make a statement in regard to it when he brings down the Budget. Or perhaps the Minister of Railways (Mr. Reid) may deal with it when he has his estimates before us. During the past few years we sold a great many rails which had been ripped up from the railways throughout Canada. Those rails were sent overseas, and I have never seen in any of the printed statements any account of
them. I think the people would like to know who owes us for those rails and if we are to be paid for them, or if they are taken into consideration in the accounts that will be filed of the indebtedness to us by Germany and those who owe us.

That is a point that has to be watched by the Finance Department. I asked my deputy to give attention to that in connection with this Bill so that we should not find ourselves without legislative authority in respect to all the amounts which we might have raised by loan in excess of actual borrowing powers at the time.

A report appears in yesterday's Toronto Globe in reference to the high cost of butter. An investigation was made by Dr. Hastings, medical health officer of the city of Toronto, who states that:
The demand for export butter at 80 cents per pound governs the price to the local consumer, and this demand has recently increased particularly in the English and United Slates
markets. On the other hand, Dr. Hastings can And no justification for the "" enormously high price of oleomargarine.""
In another part of the paper it states: Margarine, whidh has been selling in Great Britain at 25 cental a pound, is now 16 cents. Here the manufacturer's price is about 33 cents, with the dealers in some oases getting almost 50 cents.
And it wants to know why there should be this difference. We allow margarine to come into this country free of duty and if the manufacturers are extracting an unfair profit from the consumer an injustice is being inflicted upon the public and the matter is one that should receive the attention of the Government.

No one can foresee what interest rates will be. My own view is that 'they are not likely to drop materially for a considerable time; I do not see how they can. What I have said is subject to this:\tin putting out loans\none has to consider the financing that has already been done and not have his loans in large amounts too close to the present time. Let me illustrate. Suppose the Dominion Government during the war had been fearful of the comparatively high interest rates and had resorted to short-date borrowing, which is all right for comparatively small amounts in times of high interest rates. And suppose the Minister of Finance had to face within the next five years, let us say, the raising of five, seven or ten hundred million dollars; that would be a very serious matter. The amounts expended in this war, the debt of Canada and the debts of all nations, are so vast that funding is not possible as it would be in normal times. One of the advantages of our situation is that our loans are distributed over five, ten, fifteen and twenty years. I know precisely what my hon. friend has in mind-that we shall have to pay high interest rates over a period of fifteen and twenty years. That is true in respect of certain of our loans. But I do not see what advantage it would be to us within the next five or ten years, having regard to the loans we have to meet before ten years are over, to be in a position to recall the other bonds, because the financial operations would not be possible to\n\nenable us to retire them and replace them with further issues at lower rates; it seems to me that the transactions are too great. I do not like, any more than my hon. friends, the idea that the Dominion has to pay that rate of interest over so long a period. But short-date borrowing is almost fatal in war time, because you get accumulations of debt ahead of you and when you need fresh money you are confronted with maturities coming due, and a very serious situation results.""]",,,,

I stated in the House a year ago that it was the policy of the Government to utilize only existing s'teel shipyards. But there existed at Prince Rupert a large shiprepairing plant and floating dry dock, and considerable pressure was brought to bear upon the Government, especially as the war was proceeding at that time in a way that did not look favourable to us, and tonnage was very badly needed, to place some orders out there. I took the ground that the Government were not investing money in shipyards, but that if any firm would come along with the necessary capital the Government would be! willing to give them a share of their business. That accounts for the placing of orders for two ships of 8,100 tons at Prince Rupert
Victoria, B.C., likewise did not have a modern shipyard. The Victoria Machinery Depot had a small place there, and our Victoria friends, especially the late Premier
fMr. Ballantyne.]
Brewster, were very anxious that we should give the city of Victoria part of the Government business. We therefore placed an order with the Victoria Machinery Depot for two ships of 8,100 tons each
Enterprising capitalists of Halifax, Captain Norcross and R. M. Wolvin, said that they were prepared to put $5,000,000 into a modern shipyard there if the Government would give them some business. I shall not weary the Committee with an account of all the interviews that I had and of the requests that these gentlemen made and which the Government could not see their way clear to grant. They wanted us to allow them to bring in free of duty what plant they required; I told them we could not agree to do that. They also wanted a very large order for ships, as their capital expenditure was great; but I told them that all we could do would be to give them an order for four ships, which we have done. When that yard is fully completed- and it will be completed shortly, because the keels of two vessels have already been laid there-it will be one of the finest and best equipped shipyards in the country.

Mr. Hurley's proposal, which he is going to submit

to the American Congress, is that the United States Government shall sell these ships to private persons. Mr. Hurley goes so far as to say that he is willing to recommend to the American Government that they be sold, not at the cost of construction to the Government, hut at the cost of construction at the time the sale was made.
He also, of course, states that he hopes the American Government will he able to control rates; but I do not see how they can very well do so. He further states that they are going to set aside the large sum of $15,000,000 for what he calls a Merchant Marine Development Fund, so that if any of their ships are on a trade route that does not prove to toe profitable, the American Government will come to their aid. He also states that the United States is striving to be the leading maritime nation of the world; and consequently we must recognize the keen competition that we are going to have from the States.

I understand from the minister that he does not intend to carry out the proposal made in the report of the Marine and Fisheries Department. In that report at page 15 I find that the Government puiposed *o build annually
200,000	tons of merchant shipping at an estimated cost of $40,000,000 to $50,000,000. The minister to-day does not seem to hold the same view, because, if I understand him correctly, he says that when the present orders are filled, the shipbuilders will have to look out for orders elsewhere-I would like him to explain if there is really a change in the policy of the Government in that regard. I quite understand that when this policy was inaugurated ships were very scarce and the policy was justified on account of the war. The criticism of my hon. friend (the leader of the Opposition) is quite pertinent, however, when he says that the Government were very slow, that they allowed three or four years to elapse before they did anything, and then when prices were almost as high as they ever will be and when the war was nearly over they embarked on the shipbuilding programme. When this report was issued I understand the war was over, but in it I find, as I have said, that there is a proposal to go on with this shipbuilding programme.
The minister has told us that the programme is justified in order to afford ocean freight facilities for our railway system. We are undertaking the management of an enormous railway system, and of course we hope to have a great deal of traffic for export to deliver at seaboard. But I think the minister has undertaken to build the wrong class of ships, if he expects them to make connections with the National Railway system- He mentioned that the Government were following the policy of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. That company has never embarked on the building of tramp vessels. It has built liners that make regular trips, connect with its railway system, and undertake to route goods to certain places and to deliver them on certain dates. That does not seem to be what my hon. friend is doing. He is building a large fleet of slow tramp vessels that are not suitable, and never will be suitable, for that class of work. He tells us that the speed of a certain class is 8 knots, of another class 11 knots, and of the highest class only 13 knots. Well, my hon. friend

eminent authority quoted by my hon. friend is that the British yards are booked for two years and that the contracts on which they are working are on a cost plus ten per cent basis. How, therefore, can my hon. friend say in the same breath that the cost is $115 a ton?
iMr. J. H. 1SH1NICL1AH1B: The hon. gentleman is quite correct. We must make that allowance. We cannot produce ships at that rate in Canada. My hon. friend is not able to show that we can logically go on with the building of ships in Canada at the price we are now paying. Of course, we may be able to do it with Government assistance; that is how we are doing it now. But we could not do it without that Government assistance.
This programme is not a shipbuilding programme at all; it is a ship-owning programme. The Government is ordering ships at practically $200 a ton and they are bound to lose part of the money by the time they get through. If the Government arrived at some policy that would
enable private' capital to build the ships, they would be doing something worth while for Canada; but when the Government stop pouring out their money, the shipbuilding will stop. My hon. friend hinted a while ago that the Government did not intend to go very long on this policy of building ships and that the shipbuilders would have to look out for themselves. Well, that is a very poor prospect for any person who wants to put his money in a shipyard. If the Government really want to assist shipbuilding, what they should do is not to buy tramp vessels at enormous prices, but find some means by which the Canadian investor can put his own money into shipbuilding and compete successfully in that business with the outside world.
The minister is simply buying ships at a very high price, a price that will enable any builder to build them for him, but he is not doing anything to make it possible later on for a Canadian to build ships himself and to enable the Canadian people to become maritime ship-owning people. That is really a matter that the Government ought to tackle. The shipbuilding efforts of the Government have so far not been very successful.

I have been looking over the accounts for the construction of those trawlers, which accounts any hon. member can find in the room where the Public Accounts Committee meets, and I find that the seven trawlers that were sold at

Halifax recently cost $704,955.51. It would appear from the information that we get from questions answered by the minister that they all had to undergo repairs very shortly after they were built; that they were built in such a haphazard way that they were unseaworthy. According to the Public Accounts, $134,917.22 was expended in repairs. Those trawlers were sold a few weeks ago.

He refers to the Government merchant marine ships as tramp ships. If these ships are tramp ships, then all cargo vessels that ply the various waters are also tramp ships. The hon. member goes on to say that unless a ship is a passenger ship she cannot make time from one port to another. For the life of me, I cannot see why a ship, we will say of eleven knots sea speed, leaving the port of Montreal for Liverpool should not make her schedule time just the same as a passenger ship can. My hon. friend is a business man and he realizes that cargo ships are necessarily for carrying cargoes, and that it would not be an economical policy for the Government to build palatial passenger vessels to carry the cargoes that these ships are designed to carry. He goes on to say that there is no difference between the freight ships built in the United States, in England, or in Canada. He must know that there is a vast difference in the design, speed and types of ships, just as there is in the various kinds of automobiles that are made.
I cannot understand the hon. member when he classes all freight ships together, as regards cost and design. He is at a loss to 
know what particular use the Government are going to make of their merchant marine ships to co-operate with the railways, and suggests that instead of having these freight ships we should have passenger ships plying on the various oceans. Every one knows that a passenger ship has not as much available space for cargo as a cargo ship, and therefore the policy of the Government is a sound business policy. These ships were never designed to carry passengers at all, but were designed and are being built to carry cargoes. They are what the Canadian National Railway Company wants, because the government ships will carry freight from the Orient to Vancouver, and the Canadian National Railway System will carry the freight to whatever point in Canada it may be destined for.

Supposing the Dominion had issued bonds with the intention of selling them outright but in the meantime had borrowed against them from the bank-which the Dominion now seldom does-and paid off the loan to the bank, and then desired to sell the securities, it is advisable that they should be able to sell them without getting fresh borrowing powers; in other words, that they should not be deemed to be extinguished. Frequently loans are effected for the purpose of carrying securities which it is intended to sell and repay the loan from the proceeds so obtained.

Since the armistice was signed, there have been kept in military district No. 7 at St. John, N.B., some two or three or four hundred men. iSome have been released from duty at different times so that I cannot say exactly how many men are at present engaged in this garrison duty, whatever that may imply, at this military depot. Quite a large number of these men are farmers' sons who have been kept there during the winter month's when they were much needed at home to look after the farm work and provide wood and other fuel for the winter as is always customary in country districts. Some of them whom I know well, are married men With farms of their own. I have given this particular matter a great deal of consideration; I have visited the place on several occasions; I have talked with the officers,
[DOT] and, in my judgment, theTe is no reason for keeping two or three hundred men at St. John doing garrison duty when they do not want to remain there. If they were returned men waiting to be discharged who wanted to remain there, then I am prepared to say that they are entitled to re-cieve their per diem allowance and whatever is necessary to keep them there.' But these were men who were called for duty to St. John after the armistice was signed and who have been kept there ever since at the expense of this country. They are doing no good either to this country or to themselves; they are absolutely idle around this military garrison or depot or headquarters, or whatever may be the correct military term, and I * would suggest to the minister that these men should be allowed to return to their homes, thus saving the country the expense of keeping them there and permitting them to render valuable service on the farms, as is demanded by the men who own farms 
and by the fathers of those who are not farming for themselves. It has been suggested to me by one of the men and one of the officers that the only good reason for keeping these men at St. John is because the officers who are there .must have some excuse for remaining. I asked an officer whom I know very well what they were doing at St. John and why it was necessary to keep these men there. I had been down there and examined the situation, and the men were apparently not doing anything. This officer turned round to me and said: "" Copp, what do you expect us to do?"" Hon. members can draw their own conclusions. I have not the slightest objection if the officers who are there are returned men and it is necessary to keep them there in the pay of the Government. If that be the case I hold up both hands and say: Do so. But it is not necessary to keep two or three hundred men at St. John who do not want to stay for that -purpose. I have had communications; I have had correspondence with the officers in regard to the matter, and this is a mere case of keeping men there against their will; it is doing the state no good; it is an expense to the country, and it is causing a hardship to the farmers, because the men ought to be engaged in the work of greater production. I would, therefore, urge the Minister of Militia as strongly as I can to look into this matter and release these men from further service.
Major-General MEWBURN: There are eleven military districts in Canada. The hon. gentleman refers to Military District No. 7, St. John, New Brunswick, where we have maintained a very small garrison unit which is considered, from a military standpoint, absolutely necessary for a certain period during demobilization. We gave the men who have seen service at the front the first privilege of discharge, and some men were retained there, but after the armistice was signed nobody was taken there except some men who volunteered. The men are being released as rapidly as possible, and I am glad to inform my hon. friend that, on account of the opening of navigation in the St. Lawrence, very few troops now disembark at St. John and most of that unit will be demobilized -within a few weeks.

Now, a Government ship was sent from Canada to the West Indies under special conditions and my hon. friend (Mr. J. H. Sinclair) complains that the ship came back from the West Indies to New York with a cargo. Did he want her to come back empty. The hon. gentleman is a shipping man; he owned three of the poorest ships that ever crossed the Atlantic. My hon. friend criticises the Government for taking up shipbuilding. Are we to wait until the time when shipbuilding will pay? Was the building of the Canadian Pacific railway delayed until every one was sure that it would pay? No, we built it in order that it would bring returns to the country and afford transportation facilities, and that is the policy I hope the Government will carry out in respect to shipbuilding. There are many reasons for believing that at Sydney Harbour we can procure the cheapest pig iron in the world; why, therefore, can we not produce the cheapest ships in the world? The only advantage that the Old Country has over us in the matter of shipbuilding is the advantage of wages-and surely we do not wish to curse this Dominion with cheap labour. About twenty years ago we built a ship at Three Rivers-it was either the Montcalm or that other little ice-breaker we have down there-and it did not cost so very much more than it would have cost to build it in the Old Country; the difference was simply the higher wages, which is the cost of labour, I repeat that we do not want to curse this country with cheap labour.
We have at Sydney Harbour blast-furnaces, open-hearth furnace and a plate mill in course of construction. We have a rail mill that has sent from Sydney Harbour around the Horn to British Columbia rails at a lower price than that at which you could send them by rail from the Sault.
We have opportunities for the greatest shipbuilding in the world. Even if within a decade, even if within our lifetime, it should cost a little more to build ships, why should we not be anxious to develop the shipbuilding industry. The member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) and the member for Antig-onish and Guysborough (Mr. J. H. Sinclair) are simply trying to stand in the light of this country and to stamp out an industry that represents one of Canada s greatest possibilities. We have our coal; we have our coke; we have our iron; we have our steel; we have our blast furnaces; we have our open-hearth furnaces; we have plate mills in course of construction; we have a rail mill from which rails have been shipped in competition with England to be used in railway construction in the north of Ireland, Tight in Belfast. In view of these facts it is too bad that prominent public men should try to throw cold Water upon Canada's greatness. All we want is more people, more money, and more development, and the sooner we get it the sooner shall -we see in Canada ships built as cheaply as they are built on the Clyde or at Belfast.
The only insurance that it in any way high in Canada is the insurance applicable to the upper reaches of the St. Lawrence, and that is quite natural. It is a large inland waterway that must be piloted for six or seven hundred miles, where ships without skilful pilots are in danger of being run ashore. But we do not know of any heavy insurance in respect of the ocean ports of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick or Prince Edward Island. When you come to run six or seven hundred miles on the upper St. Lawrence or to the upper reaches of lake Superior, which is 2,500 or 3,000 miles inland, what can you expect? Insurance must be heavy; pilotage must be heavy. From the time you leave Cabot strait, between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, you must have two, three, four or five pilots on each ship. Shipping in Canada is one of the big questions, and the sooner we give encouragement to a Government that is prepared to go ahead with a bold policy in the matter, the sooner we shall become a shipbuilding country.
It is not many years ago; it is within the lifetime of almost every man in this Chamber that Nova Scotia built the County of Yarmouth, the largest wooden ship that ever floated on the seven seas of the world. I can remember when she ran ashore on a ledge in Sydney harbour. Is there any reason for believing that Nova Scotia can-

not build the largest steel ship in the world, when she has the men and the coal, when* she has the steel and every other commodity that enter into the building of a ship? That is the situation, and I say: All power to the Government that goes ahead with a real, good, strong, forcible shipbuilding policy, and let the Government give us the largest plant in Sydney harbour it possibly can.

-STATEMENT BY HON. MR. RALLANTYNE MINISTER OF MARINE
The House again in 'Committee of Supply, Mr. Boivin in the Chair.
Public Works-Marine Department-Government Shipbuilding Programme:-Amount required for the construction of vessel® in accordance with Government's programme-$30 000 -000.	.	(ii
Hon. CHARLES C. BALLANTYNE (Minister of Marine): Mr. Chairman, before we take up this, item in a general way, I think it would toe fitting for me to give to this House all the details that I possess in regard to the Government shipbuilding programme. A year ago I had the honour of introducing the Government's merchant marine shipbuilding policy. A great many changes have taken place since the armistice has been signed, and it seems to me to be an opportune time to furnish to this House all the information that I have on the subject for which the vote is now asked.
I think it would be well for us to look for a moment at the shipping conditions of the world, and particularly as they existed in Canada when the Government deemed it wise to embark on its shipbuilding policy. Up to about February or March, 1918, the Imperial Munitions Board were occupying all the vacant steel shipyards in Canada building ships for England. I believe that the Government of Great Britain is to be congratulated for its energy and foresight in not only having ships built to the fullest capacity of the immense shipyards of the United Kingdom, tout also for utilizing all the available yards in Canada.
But, Sir, when I became Minister of Marine I could not see what particular value the steel ships that were being built in Canada for England could be to our own country, and after considering the matter from every point of view I thought the time had come when Canada should have her own merchant marine. Therefore I had the honour and privilege of recommending to my colleagues in the Government that we should utilize our own yards to build up a national merchant marine, and, much as we admire the old country jand desire at all times to render her every assistance possible, more particularly when she is engaged in war, I con-

sider that we were doing not only our full duty to Canada, but also to the Empire when we took that course.
It will be remembered that there was an immense total loss of shipping at that time, about 15,000,000 gross tons, the war being at a very serious and critical stage, and the success of Great Britain and her Allies depending very largely on the extent of their merchant marine. So pressing was the need for tonnage that all Canadian ships under Canadian register and all ships plying in Canadian waters under British register were commandeered by the British Ministry of Shipping, a fact which left Canada devoid of a merchant marine.
At that time, Mr. Chairman, all of our Allies, with the exception of our neighbour to the south, were coming to me constantly to know if I would allow them to build ships in our yards1-I refer particularly to France and to Italy, and also to Norway, one of the neutral powers. I had to reply to the overtures made to me that the policy of the Canadian Government was to utilize to the fullest extent our own steel shipyards, and that therefore we could not look with favour upon building ships for them. It was not so much a matter of price. Many of our Allies' were willing to pay from $20 to $25 per ton more than this Government was paying for the ships it was having built under contract.",,,,

After a great many interviews, extending over some months, the Government agreed to pay the British Columbia shipbuilders $10 per ton more than the eastern price for a similar type of ship. For instance, if an 8,100-ton ship was being built by Vickers of Montreal for $180 per ton, the price for a similar ship in the British Columbia yards would be $190 per ton.
There has been some criticism of myself, especially by the British Columbia ship-

builders, because I would not allow them to take foreign contracts. When the war was on, France, Norway, and Italy were urging us to allow ships to be built here for them. I would gladly have consented had we been able to get sufficient ship plates, marine engines, boilers, and the other necessary equipment for our own needs, and at the same time have a surplus for ships to be built on foreign accounts; but unfortunately, notwithstanding the fact that we had an agreement with the United States for 80,000 tons of plate; up to the time of the signing of the armistice we had only been able to get some 6,000 tons. So I could do nothing else than say to these gentlemen that Canada could not afford to delay her own shipbuilding programme by building ships on foreign account.
With regard to the slowness of the construction of some of our ships, I admit that the yards have taken very much longer than I anticipated, but the delay has been unavoidable owing to the shortage of skilled and unskilled labour, and the great difficulty in getting shipbuilding plate from the United States, as well as engines, boilers, and other equipment. The ships are coming along more rapidly now than when the war was on. Before I leave the subject, I might say that quite recently there has been a great demand for space. Our ships are going to be operated by the Canadian Government Merchant Marine Limited, and naturally manufacturers and firms who have large orders for shipment abroad halve been coming to the Marine Department to know whether or not they can get the tonnage. I have been approached, for instance, by the Dominion Coal Company, who told me that all their ships had been requisitioned by the British Minister of Shipping, and they wanted tonnage to send t*000,0(X) tons of coal to Montreal. They said that unless the Canadian Government could provide the tonnage they might have to close down their mines, which would be almost a catastrophe. The steel men, the pulp men, the sugar men and the general produce merchants all want to know what tonnage the Canadian Government can provide. The British ships that are plying from 'Canadian ports at the present time have seventy per cent of their available cargo space reserved for the British Minister of Shipping, which leaves only thirty per cent for the Canadian export trade.

finished my sentence when the minister interrupted me. With regard to the shipbuilding programme of the Government, I have no doubt whatever that the ships we haVe built have cost us altogether too much money. Furthermore, I have no doubt that the situation is very largely due to our tariff policy, which makes it impossible for us to build ships in Canada at a price to compete with the ships built on the Clyde and other points in Great Britain. There may be other factors. The cost of labour, for instance, is a very important item, but that cost has gone up very much in Great Britain during the last year or two. I am told that it is ninety per cent higher in Great Britain than what it was two or three years ago, so the chances are that the cost of labour in Great Britain and Canada will come to be about the same. I think the Canadian workman can do just as much in a day as the British workman, and perhaps more. Our great handicap is our high protective tariff. Something could be done to relieve the situation by
bounties, and bounties have been granted in other countries. Germany and France have both given bounties to shipbuilding. France, indeed, paid bounties not only on the building of ships, but on the running of the ships after they were built. French ships a few years ago, in order to help them compete with British ships built in a free trade country, were paid so much a mile for every voyage made, and we had the ridiculous situation of French captains steering the most crooked course in order to make the longest possible voyage. During all this time Great Britain has held her own, because she has acted on the principle that the cost of the material that goes into the building of the ship is the main thing, and that ships can be built cheap only in a free trade country. The difference between Great Britain and Canada in the cost of the material is enormous. The Financial Post says:
At present, ships built in Canada are costing about double what they cost in the United Kingdom. This its due to the high cost of material which, in turn, is due to the high cost of labour mainly.
Steel plates have been available to buiders in Great Britain at a price of approximately, fifty-five dollars a ton. Compare that with the following schedule, showing the delivered cost of steel per long ton from Pittsburg and Chicago to different points in Canada:
Cost per
Prom Pittsburgh to	long ton.
Vancouver, Victoria and Prince
Rupert	$102.25
Port Arthur	 89.37
Toronto	 74.84
Collingwood		80.19
Montreal	 96.89
Three Rivers	 u	 81.87
Quebec	 81.87
Halifax	 84.67
If the man in Vancouver has to pay $102.25 a ton for the plates which the British shipbuilder can get for $55 a ton, how can his ship compete with the ship built in England ? The economic law is very simple. The British and Canadian .ship are both competing for the same business.

I can quite understand these naval men. who are probably tired of the service and anxious to get back to civilian life, all writing that they have nothing to do. But I can assure the hon. member (Mr. McKenzie) that they would not be kept in the Naval Service if they had nothing to do. There has been a great deal of talk in regard to the Niobe. We have altogether a total down there of 779 men; on the Niobe 231, guards in the dockyard, etc., 99; troops in reserve 206; on vessels at Liverpool, Nova Scotia, 40; in hospital 80; to be demobilized this week, 123. The Naval Department cannot let every man in the service go until we can enlist enough civilians to perform the .duties that are necessary ion board the Niobe. -Seamen returned from overseas, boys from the Niobe and members of the accounting staff are kept busy with the details of keeping accounts, discharge, etc., and it is necessary to accommodate on the Niobe both Canadian and Imperial naval men who are returning to Canada. Then, we have to .keep men with the large number of. drifters and trawlers owned by the Imperial Government, and until such time as we can enlist a sufficient number of civilians to take charge of these vessels we could not allow every man to go. Allow me to assure the hon. member that energetic steps are being taken constantly to demobilize these men and to see that this week alone we have demobilized 123. I hope that before long they will all be demobilized. Whoever wrote that letter considered that he was free from service six months after hostilities ceased. I do not claim to be a naval authority, but I know that no man is free from the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and no man is free from the navy, until six months after the War, which means six months after peace has been finally declared. While we do not want to hold these men unnecessarily, it would be very ill-advised, indeed, for any one to be absent without leave on May 11 because I hold that the men are n,ot_ free until six months after the war., But, in any event, I am as anxious as any one else to have them demobilized as rapidly as possible. I am .urging it every day. Just as soon as I can get civilians to take the places of these ratings I will do so. I will have something 
more to say upon the navy when I answer the hon. member for Lunenburg (Mr. Duff), but I regret to note that there always seems to be a tendency to malign our little navy and to say that our men are not doing anything when as a matter of fact they are doing good work and have performed very satisfactory service for King ana country.

I admit there has been a slight decrease in United States prices- I was saying that the economic law is very simple. A ship -I am speaking of freight vessels-that is built in Halifax or Quebec at $200 a ton cannot possible compete with the ship that is built on the Clyde or the Humber at $100 a ton. If there is a cargo of wheat to carry from River Platte to Liverpool both these ships have a chance at the business, and the ship that costs the less will in the end beat the other. If the Minister of Marine intends to do anything permanent and satisfactory in the way of establishing Canada as a ship-owning country he must adopt a low tariff policy. Give the ship-holder of Canada a fair chance and he will fight his way and win.

There is, it is true, the question of dollars and cents to be kept in view,-whether the discount that you will lose on the taxable bond will be equalized by the amount that the public exchequer will receive from the taxation on this bond. But there is also something else than the dollars and cents aspect of the question, there is a question of principle; and T say it is not democratic to have bonds floated which are tax exempt. There is a great deal of criticism of the action of the Government in floating tax exempt bonds. It allows those who have made a lot of money during the war, by profiteering or otherwise, and financial and banking institutions which have a lot of money to dispose of, to place that money in tax-exempt bonds. They were either as patriotic as they pretended and boasted they were during the floating of these Victory Loans, in which case they would have subscribed as freely whether the bonds were tax exempt or not, or else some of the feathers should be taken off their caps-and I think the Acting Prime Minister has done that to-night in stating that in his opinion the last loan would not have been as freely subscribed had it not been exempt from taxation; we would have received a certain amount but not have quite as much as we have received by issuing tax-exempt bonds. I had some knowledge of the floating of the last Victory Loan in the district of Quebec, and in that district the exemption did not influence very much the people who subscribed to that loan. They subscribed because an appeal was made to them to do so on the ground that it was necessary, for the successful prosecution of the war, to help our industries and to help the Government to carry on, to accomplish the task which they had on their hands. I believe that if a proper appeal had been made to the people of Canada at large the response would have been equally as good whether the bonds were taxable or exempt. There is a great deal of unrest and criticism among the labour classes at the present time. I have heard a lot of it in Montreal, Toronto and Quebec. The labouring classes contend that we owe great sums of money as a result of our domestic loans.
TSlr Thomas White. 1
To whom do we owe them? We owe them to those who have made money during the war either by war contracts or toy profiteering on the necessaries of life-and we have examples high up. They contend that not only do we owe the capital of our domestic loan to those people who made their money sometimes by the sweat of the working classes, but that those people have taken care that the interest they are going to derive from the money they have loaned to the Government will be tax exempt, and that it will toe the wage earner and the small man who will have to pay the greatest part of the amount which the Government has to raise to meet our expenditures and our liabilities. And thereby we invite to a great extent the criticism which is now so prevalent throughout the country. I believe the better practice would have been even to pay a higher rate of interest or a discount on the floating of our bonds. The true democratic principle is that every one should pay his proper share of the country's expenditure, and if I might be at liberty to offer a little advice to the Government it would be this, that in future when floating loans they should not make them exempt from taxation.

CLARK:,,SUPPLY.,,,"I will take any suggestion whatsoever and be glad to co-operate with my hon. friend in getting information that this country and Parliament should have. But I would suggest to my hon. friend that it is treating the Opposition rather cheaply if he delegates to one who is supporting the Government on many subjects the duty of the Opposition. I should advise him to readjust his ideas about what the duty of the Opposition is in this House. My suggestion was not made to my hon. friend. It was made to the leader of the Opposition, who, at least, will be able to deal with my point in his own way and at his own time. There has been something said about the price of steel plates in war time, at the present time and before the war. My information, Mr. Chairman, is that the price of steel plates and the price of freights are both tumbling at the present time-tumbling fast-and it will be a good thing- for -the poor people of all countries if the prices of ordinary articles of use in the household tumble at the same time. I think the Government should have something to do with that ""tumbling"" and should do something not only to relieve the high cost of contracts but to relieve the high cost of living. That is the information we have about both freights and steel plates at the present moment and if it -is correct I think that it is a very good reason why the Government should go very slowly about further extending this shipbuilding programme of theirs.
The minister has asked how we will get our wheat out unless we have ships to carry it. I should like to point out that if we are going too far along the line of high tariffs we will be landed in the situation of keeping both the wheat and the ships. We shall only be able to sell the wheat that we produce when we are up against the competition of the world again if we carry on trade in the way I believe it will be done in the very near future. We can only sell a certain amount of wheat in the world in competition with other countries that are producing it if we take the proper method of building up international trade and you cannot build up international trade or operate ships successfully unless you reduce your tariff in this country.
What is happening on the high seas of the world at the present moment? I am

glad my hon. frend the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) is in his seat because I want this last breeze to reach him before he brings his Budget down which will be fateful in its effect both in regard to the political conditions in this country and to the prosperity and progress of Canada and our ability to take our proper place in the commerce of the world.
I am credibly informed that within three weeks of the armistice British ships laden with cargoes of dry goods from Lancashire and with other merchandise were heading their way, after having done nothing but war work for four years and a quarter, to South America and to other parts of the world. And I want to ask my hon. friend (the Minister of Marine) in regard to this difficulty of getting wheat out, what he thinks those ships would do when .they discharged their cargoes? Why Mr. Chairman, inevitably they would load up with wheat, if it was to be had, and if not, they would load up with some other return cargoes to pay for those dry goods and other merchandise. But we have indulged in the folly of trying to foster a cotton trade in this country; which the biggest man in the cotton trade has said never should have been attempted-that this country is not adapted for it. As we refused in a large measure to take excellent Lancashire cottons-I am talking of pre-war prices-at half the price we have to pay for them in a country where there never should have been a cotton industry, naturally the vessels go elsewhere, and of course they do not take our cargoes babk.
I am glad my hon. friend from Guys-borough raised this question. The trade question is at the root of shipping. The instinct of shipping is in the very blood of Britons, because for centuries they have gone down to the sea in ships. And to try to build up a shipbuilding policy in this country while we maintain a high tariff, is a contradiction in economics, a contradiction to common sense, and diametrically opposed to all commercial history. I wanted to say that on general principles. I wanted to show how, and how alone in my judgment, shipbuilding can be promoted in Canada. I wanted to impress upon the minister (Mr. Ballantyne) and the Government that unless the fiscal policy of the country is changed this shipbuilding policy will be a white elephant, and all the subsidies you may grant, and all the artifices you may use to make it otherwise will fail. I do hope my hon. friend the Minister of Finance has been listening to me, because
this has a most important bearing upon the reconstruction of Canada in which we are all interested, and which we wish to see taking place upon a proper basis and with every chance of this country being the country it should be amongst the nations of the world.

I suppose that shipbuilding in this country was undertaken under the pressure of war time, and as the war is over I trust I shall keep within the bounds of moderation when I express the hope that the Government will very carefully consider this business before they give a very wide extension to it. I was very much interested and edified by the remarks of my hon. friend from Guysborough with regard to the operation of tariffs in relation to shipbuilding. As a matter of fact this shipbuilding programme of the Government is only one more illustration of the extraordinary things which people do when they are under a protective tariff. As my hon. friend indicated, we in Canada are under a very high protective tariff-not the fault of either party. With the exception of the war-time addition to the tariff, the present tariff of Canada was a bequest to the present Government from the previous government. I do not think that is capable of successful contradiction. There has been practically no change, except for war-time additions, from the tariff which prevailed practically from 1896 to 1911. If one comes to think of it, it really seems a ridiculous thing to want to build ships and do commerce at sea under high protective tariff, because a tariff is to prevent the taking of goods into your country, and when a ship goes across the sea with a cargo from Canada, it can only do successful business by bringing back a cargo. So that there is an absolute incompatibility between high tariffs and successful shipping. They do not go on together in the world to any great extent. If you make your tariff high enough you may meed penitentiaries and jails and all sorts of institutions within your country, but you will not need many ships, and if you build them you will not be able to use them. That is not only a matter of sound economic study, as my bon. friend from Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair) has indicated, but it is a matter of history.
There has only been one great shipping country in the world and that has been the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under free trade. I promised to use the language of moderation and perhaps I am putting that a little too absolutely, but how near it is to the truth will be brought home to every one in this Committee when we reflect that before the war sixty per cent of the ships of the entire world were being built by and were owned by Great Britain; with her two little islands which occupy less than half the area of the province of Alberta. In the face of that single fact, I think it is scarcely the language of exaggeration to say that there has only been one great shipping country in the world. We hear sometimes about Germany being a competitor with Great Britain in shipping before the war. Before the war more work was being turned out on the Clyde than in the whole German Empire. Germany, to do the work she did do, had to adopt free trade up to a certain point because everybody knows who knows anything about this question that Germany for years was allowing in free of duty all articles entering into the building of ships. For that reason the Committee will understand why I feel that I should be just a little cautious in advising the Government to Embark upon a very large shipbuilding enterprise in Canada and a little cautious about supporting them if they do.
But, as I say, this thing was done under the pressure of war time and from that point of view I should desire to make my criticism of the policy as moderate as possible, especially having regard to the fact that the minister has been suffering from a very serious illness. However, I should not be doing my duty to the Government or the country if I did not say that I do not believe that under her present system of tariffs Canada can compete for one moment with the Old Country in shipbuilding. I do not believe it is a possibility.
I am afraid the Government made a mistake in taking this work out of the hands of the Imperial Munitions Board. We are all familiar with what has been stated openly in the public press about that, and I fear that unless we have a very careful contradiction of these statements we will have to admit that the Government made a mistake in taking this shipbuilding business out of the hands of the Imperial Munitions Board, even during war time because we know that war time produced all sorts of fads, such as shipbuilding, daylight saving, and any number of other nonsensical things which will die a natural death. I do not mean that shipbuilding is a nonsensical proposal;

it is only nonsensical when you attempt to make it a success under a high protective tariff. I would like to make that qualification of my statement.
It is also said that, in the work which we have done in connection with shipbuilding in Canada, we have entered into very unprofitable, if not ruinous, contracts. I do not know much about the Dominion Iron and Steel Company. I suppose we should look for light in connection with this subject from my hon. friend who leads the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie). He must know something about it, as these works are in his constituency, and he will no doubt enlighten the Committee as to the figures which have been published in the daily newspapers, as to the contract that has been entered into between the Dominion Govern- -ment and the Dominion Iron and 'Steel Company and as to the price paid for steel plates. I am sure, from the deep interest that he takes in matters concerning his own constituency, he will give us the benefit of his information and of the accurate statistics which must be within his reach on such a question.

I do not offer any criticism of the contract between-the Naval Department and the Dominion Steel Company which was mentioned this afternoon. I have not seen that contract, and I have the word of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, that it may be altered or even dropped. I do not purpose to let politics interfere with my v.iews on the questions of trade and transportation, for I am a Canadian, first, last and always, and I sincerely approve of the policy of any Government which will promote our shipbuilding and improve our transportation facilities. I happen to reside in Montreal during several months of the year, where 1 represent one of the constituencies nfost interested in shipbuilding. The county of Maisonneuve has within its boundaries the establishment of Canadian Vickers Limited, and L think it is to the credit of the Laurier administration that we have that great shipbuilding plant. Canadian Vickers Limited employ thousands of men, and they have been able to build up an industry which some years ago was considered as only a dream and impossible of realization. I cannot forget that in 1&12 when the question of a Canadian navy was being debated in this House doubts were expressed as regards the practicability of that policy. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) himself stated, in a now 142H
famous speech, that not in twenty-five, or even fifty years perhaps, could we expect to build a Canadian navy. And we had the candid advice of Mr. Churchill, who told us-with some ingenuousness I should say -that we could not find riveters in Canada, and there were so many swamps that we could hardly lay keels for the proposed Canadian navy. Sir, let us not refer to that debate, because really it is enough to make us lose confidence in some of the statesmen of the Mother Country. We have passed the period when the British Government could at their own sweet will thus impose their views on credulous colonials. We have had the satisfaction since that time of establishing shipyards on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, on the river 8t. Lawrence, and on the Upper Lakes, and the British Commissioners who were appointed some years ago to study the trade conditions of the British Empire, reported that Canada was fully equipped for shipbuilding and had nothing to fear from competitors. I have under my hand the report of those commissioners, published in February, 1917, from which I read the following:
Before leaving the subject of the overseas communications of Canada we may allude very briefly to the capacity which the Dominion has for shipbuilding. We visited yards for ship construction and ship repairing both on the Pacific coast and at Montreal and we-were struck with the activity generally prevailing at all places. There is also considerable shipbuilding work on the upper lakes.
I do not know what the commissioners would say if they came back to Canada today. Had they come last year they would have seen how our shipyards kept the wheels of industry running at full speed during a very crucial period. But Canada must not be satisfied with her war industries only. During the war Canada established her ability to do things; she must go on now and adapt herself to peace conditions, profiting by the development which has taken place during the war.
The member for Red Deer (Mr. Michael Clark) spoke this afternoon of British shipbuilding as compared with Canadian shipbuilding. If we are satisfied always to look upon John Bull as the privileged one who should take care of our shipping interests we sha-11 never make any prbgress along that line. Let us learn from the old gentleman. During the last century-indeed,-since Waterloo-John Bull, much to his credit, has been able to take toll in the way of trade from every nation in the world. We Canadians, members of the great Em-

pire, should get our share of that business which John Bull has taken unto himself. I stand for a moderate and wise policy of shipbuilding for Canada, and if the Acting Prime Minister, under section 2 of the Bill, intends to apply some of that money for the promotion of shipbuilding and the improvement and development of our Canadian transportation facilities, I shall vote for the amount which is being asked this evening.
Nothing, in my judgment, has proved more adequately the ability of the Canadian people to do things than the enormous development which has taken place in our shipyards during the last three- or four years. It is urged that the Minister of Naval Affairs (Mr. Ballantyne) took away from the Imperial Munitions Board a business which that board was carrying on at our Canadian yards. It seems to me that the answer given by the hon. gentleman is a common-sense one. During the war Canada gave to the Mother Country the exclusive use of her shipyards, in which ships were built of British registry. Our ships were also commandeered. Of course, it was for the common cause. But the moment war ceased, the moment we come to peace activities, it is only common sense that Canada should take control of these shipyards and build her own ships with her own men and her own money, with a view of improving her shipping and transportation facilities.
While on this question of shipping and shipbuilding-because all this is more or less implied by the word ""transportation"" -may I refer once more to the report of the Dominions- Royal Commission? The report is a very interesting one, containing data on a variety of subjects. It is from reports prepared by people who do not live in your country that sometimes you can learn the most about your country, and I would ask my fellow members to glance over this report at times, because it contains most interesting information about Canada and about the possibilities of trade development in this country. Speaking about trade through Canadian ports, the commissioners use the following language:
""When we turn to the question of the general development of Canadian trade routes it is somewhat disappointing to find, in view of the excellence of 'the harbours of the Dominion, that much of its overseas trade is still carried on through the ports of the United States. It is estimated that in 1913 two-thirds of the Canadian export wheat was shipped through United States ports, and though quantities and proportions differ no doubt in different years, considerable -diversion from Canadian ports appears to be a normal condition.

No doubt a partial explanation Is found in the fact that the St. Lawrence ports (and Montreal especially) are not available for five months in the year, during which time there is a shorter haul from Canadian centres to New York -and other United States ports than to the Canadian Atlantic ports open throughout -the winter. But it seems worth while to examine the position and to set out briefly
(1)	What appears to be the main hindrances to the use of existing routes; and
(2)	What other alternative routes could be created or developed.
I wish to refer especially to the hindrances referred to in this report. The first is the ""depth of the St- Lawrence channel between Montreal and Quebec, and the present rat^s of marine insurance in respect of Canadian eastern ports."" I understand that the Minister of Marine has a relatively large amount in the Estimates this year to enable him to proceed with the further deepening of the St. Lawrence channel, and that the port of Montreal will receive fair treatment at his hands. I understand that the terminal facilities of the harbour of Montreal are to be considerably improved. But the main hindrance to the development of Canadian transportation-Canadian shipping, Canadian business overseas-it seems to me that this should attract the attention of the Acting Prime Minister-is the, shall I say, conspiracy?-yes, a conspiracy, of the marine insurance companies in the Old Country. Here is what the commissioners say in this respect:
It was also represented ito us that a difficulty in the way of more extended use of -Canadian Eastern ports lies in the heavy insurance rates now charged-
(a)	on- cargoes carried to and from those ports,
(b)	on the hulls of vessels using them.
We were itold that these rates are unduly
hiigh in comparison with those in force at the Atlantic ports of the United -States', an-d in particular-
(1)	that underwriters charge an extra premium on hulls of tramp steamers for one or more voyages to the St. Lawrence during the summer season,
(2)	t'hiat this extra premium is -further increased for voyages during the last two months before the close of navigation.
I believe we are being very seriously discriminated against by the marine insurance companies. It is admitted to-day that our Atlantic ports are safe and that the St. Lawrence route has been -so considerably improved, so well buoyed and lighted, and the channel so well deepened, that it offers practically no element of danger. Why is it, then, that the marine insurance companies of England are so drastic in their terms to shipping companies? That is something which is not clear to my mind and which

- somewhat prejudices me against those British marine insurance companies. It was suggested some years ago that the Canadian Government should itself assume responsibility on account of the St. Lawrence risks for a period of, say, five years. It is contended that in the course of this period the Government would ascertain exactly the extent of the additional risk involved and that in the meantime extra shipping would be attracted to 'St. Lawrence ports. If we are going to improve our transportation facilities, we should strike at once at the root of the whole trouble. Doubtless, the high insurance rates against the St. Lawrence route will always be the main hindrance to Canadian transportation interests, and I would ask the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, who is a keen business man and who knows the St. Lawrence route just as thoroughly as an old sea captain, to put another feather in his cap by settling the question one way or the other. He knows that business men and shipping interests not only in Montreal, but all over Canada, are up in arms against Lloyd's, and that a solution must be found now that we have reached peace times. We must improve our transportation facilities in order to develop our trade, because, as I stated last evening, we cannot expect to have a favourable balance of trade now that we have passed the war period. Foreign trade is the trade that we must look after, and our country should he, above all things, a big-exporting country. We have all' the raw materials, and we have the whole world to which to export our raw materials, wheat, pulp, the products of our forests, our mines and our fisheries-which	last is an industry
which has hardly begun to exploit the foreign market. The Canadian Government ought to have trade agents in various countries of the world and to advertise our products and our industries, and by means of a safe transportation ensure that those products are sent overseas. Unfortunately, in the past, we have overlooked our interests, but when we know that Canada's prosperity depends upon a favourable balance of trade, a reasonable expenditure should be made in order to promote the trade of Canada in foreign markets. In 1913, Canada exported $1,216,000,000 worth of in 1914, $432,000,000 iworth; in 1916, $741,000,000 worth-in which year we had for the first time a favourable balance of trade amounting to $233,000,000. In 1918, Canada exported $1,540,000,000 worth of goods, with a favourable balance of trade of $577,000,000.
For the twelve months ended February, 1919, Canada exported $1,216,000,000 worth of goods, with a favourable balance of trade of $284,000,000. But now the war is over; we have reached peace times and we must, if possible, maintain a favourable balance of trade. We cannot hope to reach the same high figures as during the last three or four years; hut if the Government is an up-to-date, alert administration, it will see to it that our products are advertised broadcast and that orfr transportation facilities are bettered, so that our export trade may give our people the means of paying the enormous war debt which we have contracted.
Once more, subject to the criticism that I offered last night, I say to the Acting Prime Minister that I will vote with pleasure for the development of our transportation facilities, but this implies the development of our trade, and with all due respect to the ability of the Minister of Trade and Commerce (Sir George Foster)-, I do not believe he is the right man in the right place. I would put in that department an active young man, who has new visions of things and who would transform that musty department into a business one. With these few remarks, I shall resume my seat, and I wish God-speed to my hon. friend in the administration of this enormous sum of money. I am afraid that my hon. friend has become colour blind in money matters. A dollar, a hundred dollars, a thousand dollars-there is no difference between them to my hon. friend. He has been rolling in millions and billions since the beginning of the war, and I am afraid he has lost his sense of proportion. Whether he speaks of one million or one billion, it is all the same to him. Perhaps it is due to the fact that he is an optimist; but there are limits to optimism. My hon. friend should not forget that Canada has a population of barely eight million, that we have a war debt of two billion dollars, and that although the resources of the country are immense, it may not be an easy thing in this general bankruptcy of the wdrld to develop our resources. To develop our resources we shall need the aid of foreign capital, and in order to obtain the aid of foreign capital we must certainly maintain our credit on the safety line, but I am afraid my hon. friend has long since left the safety line. However, I am willing to give him another chance. I suppose when the Budget comes down he will outline such a policy that we may soon expect the mil-lenium for Canada.

This country is passing through what might be called a. transition stage; that is since the cessation of the manufacture, on an enormous scale, of munitions, normal conditions of trade have not yet been resumed, and, in the. ordinary course, probably will not be resumed for some months to come. Under these circumstances the Government, as I understand it, have felt called upon to consider in the national interest the expenditure of sums of money for the purposes referred to in the second section of this Bill, to stimulate trade and industry and improve our transportation facilities.
I was very much interested in the statement presented this afternoon to the House by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries on the ship-building policy of this Government, I want to say in answer to the criticism that the Government did not start on this policy quite soon enough, that -as a matter of fact it was in 1917 that the British Government became thoroughly convinced of the necessity of building ships all over the world and endeavouring both in the United States and Canada to supplement their building in the British Isles by building ships wherever possible. As a result of that policy, in the spring of 1917 the Imperial Munitions Board undertook the building of ships, and a large number of contracts were let in this country for the building of ships of various kinds. In 1918 the Government of Canada who had been financing the expenditures of the British Government in this country in connection with shipbuilding thought that if it was in the interests of Great Britain to build ships in this country with Canadian assistance, it certainly would be in the interests of Canada to build those ships herself and own them for her own benefit. I do not think anybody would seriously argue that that was anything but a good policy for the Dominion of Canada. It is perfectly obvious that if Great Britain, which at the outbreak of the war had some 18,000,000 tons of the 40,000,000 tons of shipping which the world possessed, thought it necessary to pay from $185 to $210 for a ton deadweight for ships in Canada, it would certainly be in the interests of this country to follow that lead. As a matter of fact in 1918, although the price of labour was undoubtedly higher, and that of material somewhat

higher, the average price paid by this Government for Canadian shipping was, I should think, about $5 a ton less than the price for which Great Britain had let contracts in this country. That certainly was the case in the Vickers' yard at Montreal; I cannot say as to the other yards. The price therefore for which the Government were getting the ships constructed was reasonable from every aspect.
The minister told us to-day that the United States has built about 3,000,000 tons of shipping, and is contemplating building 13,000,000 tons more. I have a fairly accurate knowledge of the cost of American shipping during the war and the best information got from the shipyards themselves is that American shipping cost from $250 to $.350 a ton deadweight, which is largely in excess of the price paid either by the British or Canadian Government for their shipping. The policy of the American Government to-day is practically to write this en-normous war loss off, just as if it was an expenditure for dreadnoughts which would be no good for commercial purposes.
What I consider the essential reason why this country should continue to build ships, not merely 260,000 tons which the minister has spoken of to-day, hut a very much larger tonnage, is this: If Canada wishes to have the certainty of getting her products to other countries she must own her own shipping. The shipping of Great Britain is perfectly willing to handle any business that Great Britain- wishes it to handle. The shipping of the United States will look after the interests of the United States first; so if Canada is to be a great exporting country, as we know she will be, she must own a certain amount of her own shipping to ensure the country getting proper .attention along those lines. For that reason, if for no other, it is a national safeguard for the Government to build not only 260,000 tons of shipping, but a considerably larger tonnage.
Looking at the matter from a national standpoint, the Government have taken over certain railway systems. Controlling those railway systems and controlling ocean transportation, this Government can route everything on their own lines and on their own boats to any country we wish to export our goods to, and get a profit from one end to the other. That is one of the greatest national assets you could possibly have. The control of both railways and steamships will make for national wealth, and will improve freight rates between our West and the ports of other

countries to which our exports are to be shipped.
It has been suggested by some hon. gentlemen that the Railway Board should fix the rates on these Canadian ships. Imagine, Mr. Chairman-50,000,000 tons of world shipping, and 300,000 tons of Canadian shipping which is quite inadequate to handle the needs of our own country. If you want other ships to come here, you must pay the rate; otherwise, they will not come. If you wish to attract shipping to this country so that we can export our goods, you must pay the current rate, and I am sorry to say that so far as Canada is concerned we shall have to pay more than the current rate because of the reasons given by my hon. friend from Maisonneuve. If a boat comes from London, England; to South America, from South America to New York, and from New York to London, on what is called the Atlantic triangle, its gets a load at every place, and the result is a cheaper rat e. When a boat goes from Montreal to Liverpool it has a cargo for Liverpool, but what cargo is it going to bring back to Montreal? That is a very important factor in the rate from Montreal or any other port in Canada- On top of that, is the insurance on the St. Lawrence. It therefore seems to me that we should have a certain number of ships which the Government of this country can control, so that shipping for the transportation of Canadian products will be available, so far as the Government can make that possible.
The hon. member for Red Deer, for whom I have a deep affection and esteem, was arguing to-day that with the protective tariff we could not have shipbuilding in Canada, that shipbuilding and protection were incongruous, that imports would not come into this country if we had protection on the one hand and built ships on the other. Yet before the war, for years under protection, our imports exceeded our exports. Take the example of the United States. Twenty-five years ago England practically had control of the iron and steel trade of the world, but under a protective tariff the United Statets to-day is unquestionably supreme in that regard. Take Germany forty years ago. Under Bismarck they started a protective tariff. The country was poor and they had-no shipping, but in practically forty years they built themselves up by aid of a protective tariff to be practically the second shipping country of the world. Free trade may be an ideal thing, but if you do not protect your own people and your own
markets and - manufacturers you certainly cannot expect other countries to do it for you. Coming to the question of shipbuilding in this country, the difference between the cost of shipbuilding in Canada and in England is practically the cost of labour and material. So far as steel is concerned, places like Toronto and Montreal that get their steel from Pittsburg or wherever it may come from, are going to be able to get their steel plates practically as cheap as they do in England, The enormous manufacture of steel in the United States is constantly reducing the price just as it reduced the price of steel rails below the price in England. As to the question of cost of labour,
I am dealing with it as a pure matter of competition, and I have as high an authority as Colonel Carnegie, who represented the Imperial Government on the Munitions Board with reference to Canadian labour. After inspecting the two yards at Toronto, especially the Dominion Shipbuilding yard, he said: ""Mr. Bristol, in the Dominion Shipbuilding yard at Toronto, owing to your splendid facilities and the efficiency of Canadian labour, you are going to manufacture just as cheaply as they do in England."" I hope the prediction is true. When people talk about ships for $100 a ton dead weight in England it is absolute nonsense. You cannot possibly get contracts of that kind. The best contract you can possibly get is a cost plus 10 per cent. From the best information I have been able to get on the subject, I have not found any man in the United States or Canada who wanted to buy a ship in England, and who could get a contract price of $175 a ton dead weight, or who was satisfied if he let the contract in England that he could ever get a price that would work out at $175 per ton dead weight or get delivery of his ships before 1922. The importance of shipbuilding in this country is absolutely paramount. The objection has been made to the smaller boats of 3,700 tons built on the lakes as distinct from the 8,100 and 10,500 ton boats built in Montreal. Any man engaged in shipping will tell you that the most useful boat on the Atlantic has been for years and is to-day the 3,500 and 4,000 tonner. The reason is a simple one. It is easy to pick up a cargo of 3,000 or 4,000 tons, but for a boat of 8,000 tons you practically have to take a cargo of grain or a through cargo from Montreal to Liverpool, and the question is, what will you fill that 8,000 or 10,000 ton boat with when you come back? The same thing applies as regards trade between Montreal and South America, or Montreal and South

Africa, with which countries we are Opening up trade all the time and would open up still further if we had ships. The same applies to the West Indies. A friend told me to-day that in the Seven Islands, near Quebec, they had a great deal of pulp to ship. There was a 10,000 ton boat offered them, but they could not load more than 3,000 tons because they had not facilities. The Acting Prime Minister and the Government will be justified not merely in the programme that they have so far announced, but in the programme that has been foreshadowed to-day by the Minister of Marine in the spending of a very considerably larger sum in shipbuilding in this country, and I hope that this consideration will weight in the minds of hon. members.
We are passing through a period of unrest, when the industries of the country have not been able to resume full swing. It is in the interests of the country that the labouring classes should be kept occupied, and I submit that it is important that all shipyards, at all events during the present year, should be kept going at full capacity so that the 30,000 or 40,000 labourers referred to to-day may be kept at work.

I do not agree with him in that. I think any person starting in a new enterprise would naturally watch for the time when labour was fairly cheap and material fairly reasonable, so that he might invest his money to the best possible advantage. In 1910 the Government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier formulated a policy on the question of the Canadian navy, which incidentally carried with it shipbuilding in this country. The naval and shipbuilding policy of Sir Wilfrid Laurier at that time was agreed to by hon. gentlemen on the other side, and if it had been carried out we would have had 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913 and the best part of 1914 to our credit in our shipbuilding before the war broke out, and even in the first years of the war, being fairly under way, we would have been .able to handle our business before prices went sky high. For that reason I have made the statement several times that we started our naval and shipbuilding policy at a time when the prices were four hundred per cent higher than they were when we could and should have started, and at a time when the productiveness and usefulness of these ships will be three hundred per cent less than they would have been if we had had them at the com-
mencement of the war. I say three hundred per cent less, because by the time we get into the commerce of the world with our ships things will be getting normal and we shall have to accept the same rates as other people who had their ships built in normal times and who are therefore able to go back to normal rates. We will have to go into the market to compete with those who built at ordinary prices. We are too slow. If we were spending these large sums in shipbuilding for the purposes of the war we fail of our purpose, for the war is over and the ships are not yet available. My hon. friend's very clever and well-delivered address does not give any good reason why we did not launch upon a policy of shipbuilding at the time it was properly formulated some eight or nine years ago. As he knows very well, the reason was that the present Government would not admit that anything good could come out of Nazareth -they would have nothing to do with any policy formulated by the Laurier Government for fear it would carry any credit to that policy and to the Liberal party. They would rather let everything drop, hoping that some day in the future they would formulate a policy of their own for which they would have the whole credit.
The day came when they formulated a policy of their own, but they do not seem to be able to get very much glory out of it. It is not a policy at all; it is a sort of a driving of the scapegoat into the wilderness. The leader of the Government knows what the scapegoat was? The sins of the people were put on its head, it was blind-folded, driven out into the wilderness and left there in a place from which it would never come back. The policy of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, in so far as these manufacturers is concerned, is a policy of starting them out. He makes them invest their money in providing the plant necessary for shipbuilding, he is going to take them out beyond the three-mile limit and then say: "" Now gentlemen,
I have got you under way, and this is as far as I propose to go; you can either continue to go to sea, or turn back; I am through."" That is the policy that he has given to us to-day. He says that he is going to spend a certain amount of money, to build a certain number of ships, and then he is going to tell the people: ""You can provide your own money; it is none of my affair. I have given you a start, induced you to go into this business believing that I had a fixed, permanent policy, but I have not. You can go on or turn back, or do what you please."" Does any

person call that a policy? I do not believe it is. A policy that is permanent would be based upon some principle, whatever else it might be. We had a fair sample when, from the Conservative side of the House, they launched the National Policy in Canada. That was a permanent policy in so far as that party was concerned, and they look upon it as their policy down to the present day. But when we do not know whether it will last for a day or a week or six months nobody would call it a policy; it is only an expedient for the time being and they are likely.to drop it at any minute. Really, the Government have no policy at all in regard to shipbuilding, and no policy in regard to naval protection. The hon. member for Centre Toronto (Mr. Bristol) came to the aid of the Government with some of the product of his brain, saying that he would lead them in the way they should go.
This section points out that some of the money is to be used for "" the defence and security of Canada."" If any of that money is to be used for the purpose of securing us against extravagance, recklessness and expenditures that are wrongfully proposed and badly conducted, I should say that it would be well spent. I think that is the only security we really need at the present time. Then, provision is to be made for-
The conduct of naval and military operations in or beyond Canada and the demobilization
I have already said to-night all I intend to say about demobilization. Another provision is:
The promoting of trade and industry, and transportation facilities therefor.
I wish to take advantage of the fact that we have a gathering of the ministers here to-night that we do not very often have to say a few words on this subject. I do not know what is in the air, but we had a masterful array of talent a _few minutes ago and there are still quite a number of ministers present. I 'wish to direct the attention of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries to the importance of doing something to promote the fishing industry in this country. There is no other industry in Canada that has such magnificent possibilities as the fishing industry both on the Atlantic and on the Pacific coast. We have only been gathering the pebbles on the beach compared with the ocean of development that is open before the Canadian people. I trust 'the minister will take that into his serious consideration and that he will come down to the House with a well-considered scheme for the development of
the fisheries and will ask Parliament for enough money to carry out that scheme. It will involve the establishment of storage for bait in convenient places along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and the proper looking after of these bait storages so that they can gather the bait at the time it is available and so that the fishermen may be able to get it when it is required. The condition in Cape Breton to-day is that very often, when fish is running along the shore in hundreds of thousands of tons and within easy reach of the fishermen, they have no bait. In September and OctobeT you find people simply sitting on the banks and doing nothing because they cannot get any bait. The fishermen, as a rule, are poor, they have no cold storage facilities, they cannot preserve the bait and although it is to be found by schooner loads around the shores, they cannot get it. If the Government would provide proper facilities for storing away that bait and selling it to the fishermen at the time it is needed the catch of fish would be quadrupled in many places. Together with that, there must be the necessary cold storage on the railway for carrying the fish to the market centres. The people are beginning to realize what a magnificent life-giving, strength-producing food the codfish, herring and salmon of Nova Scotia and British Columbia are.

My good friend from Cape Breton (Mr. Butts) knows me too well to think that I would say that he had no brains. That is not the worst part of the business. I wish to take the opportunity that this Bill gives me of placing before the minister and the Government the suggestion that they should devote some time, thought and energy to the development of the fish trade of this country. Perhaps on some other occasion I shall have a better opportunity of quoting data that will show the importance of this -trade, but I hope- particularly in view of the observations made by the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) that the Minister of Marine and Fisheries was a "" live wire "" and that he would like to see him in charge of the Department of Trade and Commerce-that he will give particular attention to this subject. This is the business of which he has charge at the present time, but according

to the Scripture those who are faithful and useful in small things ishall he put in charge of greater things and shall enter into the joy of their Lord.
I hope that he will show in the apprenticeship that is assigned to him in the Fisheries Department such ability as will justify the next Prime Minister-who will, of course, be the hon. gentleman who is now leading the Government-promoting him to the Department of Trade and Commerce, where it is suggested his energetic personality will find fuller scope.
I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister of Militia and of the Acting Prime Minister where some of his money that is to be expended in connection with war gratuities and demobilization should go. An Order in Council was passed by the Government some time after the 11th November (when the armistice was signed) giving gratuities to certain military men who	were	in	the	service on	thatdate,	but	not	to	those who	had
served their country at least equally as well but had been already demobilized. Here is a concrete case in my own town. The 94th Highlanders, a regiment of militia, was ordered to camp at North Sydney in the early stages of the war. It was put on home service and formed a sort of nucleus to which recruits were sent, trained to some extent, and as rapidly as possibly moved overseas. I am told that something like 1,200 men passed through the 94th to the front, and that the 94th itself would have gone had it been given the opportunity. A short time before the"" 11th of November the 94th was demobilized to a very great extent and a new establishment was set up in which the military authorities retained a very small group of those men- The colonel, the captain, and a great many soldiers were sent home as being no longer required. Those men would certainly have been in camp on the 11th of November had it been left to their own volition and would be entitled to the gratuity. I submit to the Minister of Militia and to the Committee that that is not a fair deal, that those who for nearly four years rendered good and faithful service are equally entitled to the gratuity although they were obliged to leave the regiment before the 11th of November. This phase of the subject has been strenuously presented to the Government and to the minister already from several quarters and I need not elaborate it further. I have not heard what the decision of the Government is, but I trust they will so amend the Order in Council that those who were demobilized before the day of the 
armistice will be treated as well as those who happened to be retained in the service.
There is another point I must bring to the notice of the Minister of Militia in connection with the 94th. When that regiment was called out first the colonel-Colonel J. D. McRae-was obliged to hire a house in the city of Sydney while proper barrack accommodation was being prepared for the officers. When the regiment went into camp under canvas the house was given up; and I am very much surprised that the department up to this date has refused to reimburse the rent paid by the colonel. I have not had an opportunity of bringing this matter to the notice of the minister himself, although I have had it up with the department and have been turned down. I had practically given the case up as hopeless, but seeing that this vote covers money to be paid out in connection with matters of this kind I wish once more, with the greatest possible confidence, to ask the minister that this rent 

it is only $75, a very small amount indeed for the department, but too .much for a poor officer to pay out-be reimbursed to Colonel McRae.
Major-General MEW^RURN: I am very glad that the hon. member has brought these two matters to my attention. With regard to the war gratuity, I can assure him that personally it will have my sympathetic attention. It is in the hands of a committee, and I hope the situation will be satisfactorily dealt with. With regard to Colonel McRae, I think my hon. friend should not be tired in well doing. He says that he has already brought it to the attention of the department and been refused; but I can assure him that I will see what the trouble is.

It was taken in war time and as a war measure. It was a necessary war measure at a time when it was hard for our Allies to obtain the needed supply of fats. I can assure my hon. friend that that action especially was not taken by the Government on its own initiative without its being convinced of its necessity from the standpoint of the allied cause and of the proper feeding of the armies and the people of the allied countries.
I shall not enter into a discussion of the question of reciprocity. I shall also not follow my hon. friend the leader of the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie) in what he said as to the naval policy. I had so many all night sessions in 1913 in respect to that interesting and important subject that I have not quite got back my sleep yet. I therefore hesitate to embark upon the discussion of so highly controversial a question. I had the view and I think I said so on more than one occasion, that the country could have stood both a Canadian navy and the contribution of three dread-naughts. Sometimes a combination policy is a very good one. We have found that out since the war, but those were the days in which, quite properly, I think, we scrutinized expenditures very carefully and an undertaking of that kind seemed to be formidable.
I am not unmindful of what has been said by hon. friend from Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) in regard to the desirability of the Government considering carefully the question of expenditures and I take in good part what he said as to a minister who has gone through the war probably becoming accustomed to expenditures of large sums without realizing their full signifi-

cance. But, I endeavour to check myself up from time to time and il may say to my hon. friend the leader of the Opposition, who also referred to the subject, that I do not in the least minimize to the House and to myself the extreme gravity of these large expenditures.
The expenditures which we made during the war were imposed upon us by military exigency. Canada did not count the cost during the war. She put forth her maximum effort and if the war had continued as long as this or until a year from now, instead of diminishing, we should have been increasing our efforts. Expenditure during war is, I will not say beyond the control of the Government, but in many respects it is practically so. The nation is doing its utmost to win the war. Every effort is being put forward, every energy strained, the public are in no mood to accept the excuse of financial considerations standing in the way of anything that appears necessary to promote the national effort in the struggle; consequently the position of the Finance Minister during the war is one largely of finding money for huge military expenditures. He endeavours to exercise a certain measure of control but after he has done his best, while the war is on, there is a vast amount of expenditure that is uncontrollable and it is his duty to find the money.
Now, the war is over, but, as I pointed out last night this is a war year.
We had the situation confronting us, when the armistice was declared, which I mentioned last night, and which threatened to throw out of employment some 200,000 people; we had the prosipect of so many of our men returning, and returning quickly, to be reabsorbed into civil life. It is a time of great unrest all over the world, we are not exempt from that unrest, and with every desire to keep our expenditures down I am satisfied that the policy for this year is to make expenditures upon a large scale for productive undertakings in order to furnish as much work as possible. Our people have suffered, as people all over the world have suffered; the cost of living is very high, and the combination of unemployment and high cost of living is one which leads to serious situations wherever it occurs.
With regard to that, may I put forward a suggestion which has occurred to me on more than one occasion? The concomitants of war are always plague and famine. The world has had plague in the shape of influenza, and to-day, if the world is considered as a whole, there is famine. There
is no famine in Canada, for we are a food-producing and food-exporting country. But if we take into account central, southern and southeastern Europe, parts of Belgium and France, and especially Russia, we realize that agriculture on that continent has been partially destroyed by the war. Millions of men have been withdrawn from tillage, cattle have been killed, herds necessarily have been allowed to run down, horses have been taken for the use of the armies, implements have been destroyed on a vast scale, particularly in Russia during the agrarian risings throughout that great republic, and if we take the vast tract of desolate occupied territory, it is not too much to say that the world is suffering to some extent from famine. Now, that makes a great world demand for foodstuffs; that in turn causes high prices, and, as I stated, we have here, as we have in all other countries, high prices for the commodities that are essential to life. If we should have also unemployment on an extensive scale throughout this country the consequences would be quite serious.
The Government has endeavoured to do its best to meet that situation. I do not say that every action of the Government has been the wisest possible; I am only speaking of the average of what we have done since the armistice in November last. I desire again to assure the House that I realize the enormous liabilities that have accumulated as the result of the war, and that I am very vitally seized of the importance of not engaging in any expenditures that are not productive or are not necessary to keep our industries going to the extent of furnishing employment to those of our population who may be in danger of unemployment and who have rendered such patriotic service during the war-
I think I have covered nearly all the points adverted to by hon. members opposite. It was not my intention last night to reflect on hon. gentlemen of the Opposition as to their attitude towards manufacturing industries. I was simply answering the argument which was put forward, as my hon. friend will see on perusing Hansard.

not. We should have got a substantial subscription but nothing like the amount we did get- I can say that positively because I went into the matter most carefully. Take, for example, financial institutions which are purchasers of bonds that are offered on the open market; they would have purchased a certain amount but nothing like the amount they did purchase. They could go on the open market and buy. Take the situation in the United States last year. Large insurance companies there which have to earn a certain rate of interest upon their investments in order to make a slight profit, or to carry their liabilities, can take a certain amount of taxable loan at a lower rate of interest than the market rate, but if they had all their surplus funds invested in that and found that these bonds went down five to ten points it would be a very serious thing for them. The rate of interest in the market is determined by supply and demand the same as the price of any other commodity and it is a most extraordinary thing that at the end of this war in which the finance of all countries has been disturbed and dislocated, in many cases shattered, we find ourselves with our securities during the war standing at par and above. Over a million and a half of the people of this country invested in the Victory Loan, and there is a much better feeling in this country among the people who subscribed to this loan that their securities are standing at par and over and that they can realize, if they want to, the amount they paid for them. If these securities were down flvo.-Or ten points and if we put out another loan on a 5 per cent basis, or on a 5i per cent basis, only one thing would happen and that would be that we would have to count on a discount- If the previous loan had gone to a discount, when it came to the floating of the next loan, the fact of that discount would have an important bearing.
I feel that our war financing has been very successful, even if I do say it myself. I felt that we should pay a reasonable rate of interest upon our borrowings. I do not mean to say that the Canadian public might not have taken once or twice a loan at a rate below the market rate, but I do not believe that is a wise policy especially in connection with a long war. When you offer securities to the public the best factor you can have is a lot of pleased subscribers to the previous loan. From the beginning of the war we were in competition with Great Britain's securities in New York and when I offered some of my loans in New York and some of the loans in Canada British securities were selling as low as on a 7 or 8 per cent basis in New York. So were the securities of France as well as other securities of the highest grade. In our financing during the war we had to take conditions as we found them and deal in New York or here as best we could-
In the war loans we engaged the interest of all sections of the community; and I want to pay my tribute here and now, as I have on every platform on which I spoke, to the members of this House on both sides, and to the Canadian people without distinction of class, race and creed, who assisted me to the utmost of their ability in floating these loans. Otherwise we could not have done it. There was co-operative effort on the part of everyone. I have heard no complaint from the time the first loan was floated down to the present, of there being any favouritism, or discrim-

ination, or political influence, or patronage, in reference to the flotation of our 'Canadian war loans.

If we could float a taxable loan at

a rate of interest which would compare favourably with the rate which we should obtain on tax-free issue, and having regard to the amount of income tax we would receive if the loan were taxable, I would be strongly in favour of issuing bonds not tax-free. My hon. friend is no doubt aware that when you come to face a market you have to pay a much higher rate of interest, even upon Government loans, where your securities are issued subject to taxation, than you do where the securities are tax-free. I am speaking only from memory, because it did not occur to me that the question would arise to-night. In the United States I think there is a point difference between tax-free securities and taxable securities, and on a large loan the annual difference in interest which you have to pay as between tax-free and taxable issue is very large, and if one looked at it purely from the business standpoint he would calculate as to what revenue would likely be received from a taxable loan, and in that connection he would have to consider the exemption granted under our Income Tax Act. In this country he would, I am sure, reach the conclusion that the tax-free issue gives a better result in an annual budget than a taxable issue, because the amount which would be received by way of interest on a taxable bond would not be as great as the annual amount which the Government would have to pay in excess interest upon the taxable issue. There is another aspect of the matter to which attention must be given. Under an income tax graduated as ours is, there is reached a point at which there is a decided advantage to those of large incomes in buying the tax-free bonds. That is unfortunate. To some extent the issue of tax-free bonds is inconsistent with a steeply graduated income tax. One must consider market conditions, 'and whether outstanding issues which are in competition with him in his loan are tax-free or not, and be guided by the situation with which he is confronted. It is very difficult to say in advance what one will do until the time is reached. When we put out our first loan in New York and the second loan in 1917 the very first point that arose was that the bonds must be tax-free. You could not sell an issue at that time in the United States on taxable bonds for the reason that Canada was at war. They did not know but what they might be taxed at their source here, and you could not sell an issue of taxable bonds in the United States at that time. You could not sell a taxable issue of Cana-

dian bonds in the United States to-day. I raised the question as to whether these bonds might not be taxable to parties not resident in Canada, but on account of the proximity of Canada to the United States, parties in the United States want the benefit of the markets both of Canada and of the United States, and the result was that our bonds in our issues there had to be tax-free. Our bonds being tax-free there, people in Canada desiring to buy bonds, by reason of the exemption given in respect of income tax, could buy them in New York. All the securities we issue here are in competition with all the securities outstanding here and in New York. It is a matter to which I have given a great deal of anxious thought, and there are 'two sides to the question I frankly admit. It is a question of calculation as to what will give the best results to the Dominion. There will always be a certain dissatisfaction if parties of large incomes can buy tax-free bonds and thus escape to some extent from income taxation. But, on the other hand, we must consider what the rate of interest would be as between a taxsfree and a taxable bond and endeavour to do the best we can with the situation.

She is not only building her own merchant marine, but war ships too, so their Minister of the Naval Service, Sir Joseph Cook, informed me when I was in London. Australia has erected during the war a plate mill. Besides the ships Australia is now building, she bought ten ships in 1915 or 1916 and these have proved to be very profitable. They are now building twenty ships more. The Acting Minister of the Australian navy, Mr. Poynton, announced on April 10th that the Australian Government would remain in the shipping business and would continue its shipbuilding programme. He said that their present programme contemplated the building of twenty steel ships.

Major-General MEWBURN:
1.	P.C. 316, dated February 8, 1918, provides for the appointment of a general auditor for the Militia Department, responsible to the deputy minister. Previous to this date, the audit was carried out as a part of the work of the branch of the Accountant and Paymaster General.
2.	Under P.C. 1136, dated May 22, 1918, the General Auditor of the Militia Department was removed from the jurisdiction of that department and ""made responsible to and under the control of the Auditor General."" This step was taken after consultation with the late Auditor General, who has initialled the original Report to Privy Council. This was done in vierw of the tremendous expenditure of the Department of Militia and Defence under War Appropriation, and the provisions of the said Order in Council have been accepted by the present Auditor General as a temporary measure, until such time as the Militia Department comes back to its ordinary level. Under the provisions of P.C. 1136, all accounts are audited before payment by the representa-

tive of the Auditor General* thus safeguarding public funds to the greatest extent possible. The Auditor General still receives the usual accounts and evidence of payment. Previous to the passing of P.C. 1136, these accounts were paid by the Department of Militia and Defence and post-audit carried out by the Auditor General. Under the provisions of P.C. 1136, all accounts are audited before payment by the representative of the Auditor General.
3.	Yes-Answered by Nos. 1 and 2. The Auditor General was a party to the arrangement, and not compelled, as implied.
4.	Lieut.-Colonel D. F. Pidgeon joined the C.E.F. on August 10, 1914, as a lieutenant; was promoted to the rank of captain and served overseas 12 months, 9 months of which in France

The matter has not been

considered by the Government, but naturally when the shipyards complete the building of the ships that are ordered by the Government now, and a few more that will be ordered, it will be a problem that the Government will have to deal with, as to whether they will let these shipyards go out of existence altogether or give them a fair amount of protection the same as other Canadian industries are enjoying and have been enjoying for some years. That is all I wish to say on the shipbuilding policy and programme of the Government.
But I want to say something in reference to ship plate contracts. Over a year ago the Government entered into a contract for
250,000	tons of ship plates at $4.15 per hundred pounds based on the price of steel billets at $25.50, and as the price of steel billets would go down, so would the price of ship plates. From time to time the Government will place their auditors in the steel company's plant in order to check up their costs. The total amount of plate tonnage that we contracted for was 250,000 tons. What caused the Government to give this contract was the scarcity and the impossibility of getting ship plates from our neighbours to the south in order to carry on our shipbuilding programme. No one at that time could foresee the end of the war. It might be a year or more before the conclusion of hostilities, and when a country is at war, as Canada was, it is necessary to prepare for an indefinite continuance of war conditions. The shipyards at that time were paying for plate all the way from 4 cents a pound up to 10 cents. The ruling price in the United States, outside of the plates required for the Government ships, was from 4 to 54 cents. I called into competition the great United States steel companies, besides inviting all the steel companies in Canada to tender, and the best price I could get was $4.15, the United States steel price being 4i cents per lb. Since the letting of this contract the armistice has been signed, and the price of steel plates has dropped to 2J cents in the United States and may possibly go lower. I therefore recently interviewed the officials of the steel company and pointed out to them that this was a war contract that we had entered into with them, and that in view of the price of steel plates -having declined so much in the United States, and for other reasons, I wanted to negotiate with them for a modification of the existing contract. I met the President and the Vice-president of the Dominion Steel Corporation, who could not have met me in a

more broad and patriotic spirit than they did; and while they said that they were sorry to lose such a contract if they had to, they were prepared to make any modifications that I, as a responsible minister would care to propose with the approval of the Government. These negotiations are being carried on at present, and the contract will either be modified or be entirely cancelled. The Government have not yet got the necessary information before them to decide what action they will take, but I am free to state now that we can modify the contract or, if we prefer, as they have met us in a very broad spirit, we can cancel it.

been built nominally for the British Government, but they were really built for the Canadian Government. The Canadian Government paid for them and they appear in the Canadian Government accounts which we are now examining in the Public Accounts Committee, so that I think I have a right to refer to them. I find those trawlers were sold for $270,000. They cost including repairs $839,872.73, so that they were sold at a loss to the country of $569,872.73. The extraordinary thing to me is that the minister or somebody in the Department of Marine and Fisheries did not think of utilizing those trawlers on the coast for fishing purposes. The price at which they were sold is a mere bagatelle compared with what they cost, and it would surely have been profitable for some enterprising Canadian to use them on our coasts in developing our great fishing industry. I find also that 65 per cent has .been allowed Vickersby the minister for what are called overhead charges. I am not very familiar with manufacturing, and I am not going to say that that is an extortionate rate, because I am not sure, but it looks large to me. For example, I find, for labour in connection with the construction of those trawlers in Vickers' yard in Montreal, an account dated August 29, 1917, amounting to $10,790.86. The builder is allowed to add 65 per cent to that for overhead charges, or $7,014.08, making a total of $17,804.94. Sixty-five per cent looks large to me for overhead charges, and has the appearance of profiteering. But this account is certified that the prices charged are fair and just, signed by Mr. James A. Wilson, Director of Stores. Another certificate reads:
I hereby certify that the prices are according to contract.
(Signed) L. J. Beausoleil,
Chief Accountant.
It appears, therefore, that the minister must have made a contract by which he allowed Vickers Limited to charge an overhead charge of 65 per cent in addition to the cost of labour. Take another account:
War appropriation vote-6 steel trawlers.
Labour	$5,491.23
Commission,	65 per cent	 3,569.30'
Total	  $9,060.53
I should like the minister, if he does me the honour at any time of replying, to explain to the Committee if he regards that 65 per cent overhead charge as reasonable.
Last night some very serious charges were made against the Department of Naval Affairs by the hon. member for Lunenburg (Mr. Duff). They were so serious that the leader of the Government (Sir Thomas White) decided that he would not go on any further with the estimate, but would give an opportunity 'to the Minister of Marine and Fisheries (Mr. Ballantyne) to answer the hon. member for Lunenburg.

That is only a question of the length of the ships. Other nations could have brought their ships in here. The Germans, for instance, could have done so. The canals were free to any nation in 'the world. The question of free trade versus protection was not involved, in this subject at all. My hon. friend knows very well what is the fact to-day, that all the material entering into shipbuilding can be brought into this country free of duty. There is no duty on bars, plates, or anything of that kind, that enter shipbuilding, and for that reason shipbuilding can be carried on in this country regardless of tariff and should be encouraged.
What was the reason that we wanted to get into a shipbuilding business, and why were these contracts given for ships? We all know that with the advent of the submarine the economics of war, as I might say, underwent a great change. The world found that ship after ship was being lost, that there was a great shortage of ocean shipping, and that the goods of this country might not find their way abroad. As a matter of fact at the present moment there are millions of dollars worth of goods in the warehouses of Canada awaiting shipment to China, Japan, and other foreign countries, and we cannot get the bottoms to ship them out- The absurdity of standing up and opposing a programme that will give us a few ships to carry on this foreign trade shows to my mind the ignorance of

those men who speak on topics they do not know anything about. If you go to any Canadian manufacturer to-day you will find that his warehouses are filled with goods for export to South America, China, South Africa and India, and that he cannot find any shipping for them. For New Zealand they will not take a car of stuff from any station in Ontario to-day until ships are provided, and there are no ships for the thousands of dollars worth of merchandise lying in our warehouses waiting for shipment to that country.
Hon. gentlemen who discuss questions affecting the commerce of the country should post themselves a little better in the matter. The world is moving; conditions to-day are not as they were twenty years ago. The wheat of the country should be taken out on our own ships. Every nation to-day is jealous of its shipping. At the very moment that the Government gave its first contract for the building of ships the Japanese Government established a programme, to extend over seven years, for the purpose of absorbing every pound of plate they could get in Canada or in the United States. If the Minister of Marine wants to sell his ships, he can sell them to-morrow to the Japanese Government at ten or fifteen dollars a ton more than he is paying for them. There is no lack of market for ships to-day throughout the world. The contracts were not improvident.
The hon. gentleman quoted the Financial Post as saying that plate was selling at $55 a ton. With pig iron selling at Lancaster at $50 I do not see how you can get plate at $55. The quotation given in the Post is an absurdity. Plate is really selling higher to-day in England than it is in Pittsburg; the Government absorbed the difference. If we do not have our own ships during the next five or ten years we cannot carry on business with any foreign country, because each nation has taken hold of its shipping as a national business and will not allow its ships to be used in the trade of any other nation. Great Britain has absolute control of its own shipping; a British ship cannot go to a foreign port without getting authority from the British Government to do so. During the war embargoes were placed on shipping as against foreign countries. For nearly a year foreign shipping was not allowed to go to Norway because Norway would not allow its ships to be used by the Allies, and thousands of tons of freight were lying in the harbours of New York, Boston and Montreal awaiting shipment to Norway. A short time ago the United States placed an embargo on

the products of Canada going to Norway through American ports. It will be only a matter of weeks before the United States Government places an embargo on any Canadian products going out in United States ships, because they want all that trade themselves, just as every other country wants its own trade.
As to the cotton industry and the shipping industry of Great Britain and free trade, school boys who do not know anything about history might say that free trade built up the shipping trade of England. But every one knows that the shipping trade of England originated in the navigation laws of Cromwell, which were a most effective form of protection. Great Britain put the old navigation laws into force during the war, and made them more rigid than they ever were. She would not permit any foreign neutral nation to carry trade to belligerent ports. Is that free trade? That is the condition we ourselves are up against; we want our own ships to carry our own cargoes. I will give an illustration of how Great Britain desires to curtail the trade of the world. A Canadian firm had a cargo of goods for consignment to Calcutta. The goods had been manufactured in Canada and had remained in stock a considerable time awaiting shipment. The man who manufactured the goods asked the Canadian Pacific Railway Company if they would give him a freight rate to Calcutta, and they did, quoting him a rate of something like say $70 a ton via the Pacific. The manufacturer tendered this rate to the British firm which had the goods here, and they said that the goods had to go via London, and that the freight to London was over $60 a ton and only $7 or $8 a ton from London to Calcutta. This shows what steps are taken by the British Government to control traffic to and from British ports. If you are going to build up this country; if you are going to make Canada a country which does business all over the world, you must start out in a proper way. Before the war Great Britain's most prominent competitor was Germany. How did Germany carry on her foreign trade? How was it that she went into the foreign market and took one-third of the trade away from Great Britain inside of fifteen years? The reason is simple. She bonused her ships and shipbuilding. It is absurd to say that the plates and material that entered into the manufacture of German ships were made in Great Britain and taken over to Germany and fabricated. That is not so. When the war came Germany had more plants manufacturing steel
plate than Great Britain had. Moreover, they had purchased many of the steel manufacturing industries of Great Britain and moved them over to Germany. When the waT broke out not one firm in Great Britain was manufacturing cold rolled shafting, because they had been accustomed to get it cheaper from Germany. During the great pageant at Quebec I had the pleasure of visiting one of the greatest ships of the British fleet, and when I set foot on the deck of that warship I saw that the plate on the side was stamped ""Krupp steel,"" presumably made in Germany. That indicate what the condition of affairs was before the war; and that is the condition of affairs that an adoption of the policies advocated by free traders would bring to any country. Free traders would bring about a condition in which the nation would be only a jobbing nation, not a -manufacturing or producing nation. That might do for Great Britain, but not for Canada.
Germany built up her maritime and foreign trade by subsidized shipbuilding and encouraging shipyards. Before the war, when the shipbuilders had gone on strike in Great Britain, the emissaries of Germany were at the Clyde, at Newcastle and other places in Great Britain, offering these skilled workmen big inducements to go to work in Germany. Many of them went over, and a shipbuilding industry was established in Germany such as we are trying to establish in Canada with the same class of men. The greatest ships of the world were built in these German shipyards previous to the war. The supremacy of speed on the ocean was successfully contested by German shipbuilders as against British shipbuilders. Now, what was at the bottom of all this shipbuilding? There was a desire on the part of Germany to get the trade of the world. You cannot get the trade of the world by simply making the stuff; the secret of getting the trade of the world is to provide the necessary transportation. If we left it to the people of the United States to build up our railways in the West, how far would our West have gone? It is the old story of the lark and her young ones; if you want to do anything properly you must do it yourself and then you will know that it is done, and as you want it to be done. If you want to carry on foreign trade you must provide the transportation for it; otherwise you are at 'the mercy of all foreign nations and traders, w,ho will absorb your profits. Germany realized that. She established lines of trading ships between

German ports and all the leading ports of the world. Moreover, she provided that all inland manufacturers in Germany should have the benefit of the same rate to any of the ports of the world as that paid by the manufacturers on the seaeoast. In other words, a manufacturer in Leipsie could get the same rate from Leipsie to Smyrna as a manufacturer in Hamburg could get. All manufacturers were on the same footing in that respect. The same policy should be adopted by our National Steamship Company so that manufacturers in all parts of Canada will have the same freight rate to all parts of the world. The Germans established a freight rate from Germany to other countries which (was fully one-third less than the freight rate from Great Britain to other countries; and they made a profit on the return trade. For instance, the freight rate to-day from New York city to Calcutta, as established by the United States Government, is $20 a ton. The United States control their shipping, and a United States ship may not carry a cargo to a foreign port without a license or charge more than this rate. That is what we are going to be up against, and if we have no ships of our own -we shall not be able ito get a pound of any commodity out of this country unless we pay exorbitant freight rates. If this country could give a freight rate of $18 per ton to Calcutta, we could secure the business, so closely is international business mixed up. With ocean rates the freight rate is the controlling element. That is the whole question in a nutshell, and if I had my way *-I do not know whether my voice will be heard in the councils here any more than that of the hon. member for Red Deer (Mr. Michael Clark) -I would suggest this. We as a young country must make up our mind that we have to take up our task as Empire builders. We have all the raw material for Empire building; we have the farms, the fields; we have the power; we have the workmen; we have the finest men in the world to undertake the task, men who have gone through the war and acquired discipline and training. If we are to be, a great country, we must put our shoulder to the wheel and make up our minds that we are to be Empire builders. Germany was a protectionist nation, and was the one nation in the world that successfully contested the supremacy of England in matters of foreign trade, and we can remain a protectionist nation and we can follow out a similar policy. We must establish a number of 
steamship lines. We must establish a steamship line from here to the East Indies, where there is a very profitable trade, where we can send manufactured goods of our own and bring back in return tea, jute and other articles that are brought in to this country now in foreign ships, and that might very well be brought back as a return cargo in our own ships. Before the war this enormous trade with India went to Germany. Besides we are going to get an Imperial preference. We must not, because the war is over, lie down and go back to our little five acre lot and say: Oh, well, we are done with the war, we want to revert into our shell again. We have taken a place in the sun and we must now stay in the sun. We should have a line of steamers to Australia and New Zealand. At the present time the New York manufacturers and traders are lying awake in bed at nights wondering what preference we shall have with Australia and New Zealand. They are all wanting to open branch offices in the cities here in order to see if they cannot get a share of that trade. There are many things we could bring back from New Zealand. We could bring back a return cargo of hides and wool to Great Britain, and then we could bring back from Great Britain a cargo of other things which we need. The hon. member for Red Deer may wonder what we require from Great Britain, but there are many things which we need which Great Britain could supply just now, but she cannot furnish ships to send them here. There is no lack of demand in this country for British goods; 'the only thing we really lack is shipping.
In South America there is a market for all the goods we manufacture, such as hardware, furniture, clothing of various kinds, cottons, goods of all descriptions, and we could bring back coffee and hides. "" Oh,"" but the hon. member for Red Deer says, "" That is a contradiction to your policy of being a protectionist. Why should you bring back hides? Your policy is to produce hides here."" That's true, but we can get only hides for fully fifty per cent of the leather we turn ou't in this country. We are large manufacturers and exporters of finished leather, and if we endeavour to get hides from South America via the port of New York, as we do now, we are liable to be tied up by the United States Government. They will say: We will allow you only so many hides, as if we were an "" adjunct."" Therefore, if we had our own ships, we would not be under the necessity of looking to them for favours. We could bring

the hides hack here in our own ships, so that the New York merchants would have no control over our trade and would not be able to milk the profit out of it as against the Canadian manufacturer.
In these countries we have traded with during the war and established a market for our goods, and we did not have to furnish a national credit. They have plenty of gold. Unless steps are taken to establish lines of shipping from Canada to these various countries we shall have lost all the advantage of trade during the war, and Great Britain, France and the United States will have gone into these countries and secured the business which we had.
The hon. member for Red Deer spoke the truth when he said that the ink was not dry on the armistice when English ships were going out laden with goods to capture the trade of the world. Before the ink on the armistice was dry Canada should have been ready, too. In fact, we were doing a large amount of that trade which Great Britain could not do before the war. But, knowing a certain phase of trade from the ground up as I do know it, I would say to the minister that the worst thing '.that this country ever did in the matter of shipbuilding was when it lent money to Great Britain to build ships for the so-called Imperial Munitions Board, in order that those ships might go into competition with the ships we own ourselves. There was no necessity for that, and all those ships should have been held by us, so that we could control our own shipping and trade, and do something to adjust matters that the freight rates on our Western wheat would not be so great and would not bear so unequally on the man who lives in the shadow of the Rockies, so that he would have an equal chance in the markets abroad. These ships were built for the Imperial Munitions Board; Canada lent the money to Great Britain for them, and no sooner were they launched into the waves and sailing out on the sea than the fleet was turned over to the Cunard and other lines that have been milking this country for many years on the Atlantic. If we had those ships, they would have assisted us in carrying on our foreign trade, and I make this prediction that before four years aTe over this country will realize it has not enough ships to carry on its business.
Let me say a word in reference to the price of steel plate- Everybody knows the price of plate and other steel commodities was very high, and when the minister made the contract for the steel plate for ships
it was almost impossible to get plate for any work whatsoever. Shipping was all under control and the whole world was tied uip, and I think the contract that the minister made was a very easy contract at that time, because, comparatively speaking, the price was low, and it would have been a good thing for this country if, during the war, we had had two or three firms making plates, as there was a great shortage of plates in the world. But the economic war is not over yet and I am going to make another prediction, namely, that before many years are over the minister will find that he has not made a bad bargain in the matter of plate mill. The shelves of the world are empty so far as iron is coneferned, and while at present there is a halt in the purchase of such goods, the fact will very soon be realized that there is not sufficient of these goods available and prices will rise accordingly.
The Saar valley, which was a great mining field where the Germans got their iron ore and which furnished forty per cent of the steel materials that went into the foreign trade of their country, has been put under international control. Germany has lost the Saar _valley where all her great iron mines were. Her furnaces and steel mills are in Westphalia where her coal mines are, but where there is very little iron, and it looks as if the products of those mines are going to be out of the market for the next three or four years until France can build blast furnaces that will take that iron and smelt it and roll it. The result is that there will be a shortage of steel, while the trade of the world which has languished during the war will, within a few months after the Peace Treaty is signed, increase by leaps and bounds and be far greater than it ever was before, because people are trading and doing business abroad who never did any trade of any description before-
As to the influence on shipbuilding of free trade or protection, I trust that the minister and the Government will realize that there is nothing in that story; it does not affect shipbuilding to the extent of a five-cent piece. Every hon. gentleman knows that the materials that enter into the building of a ship come into this country free of duty; at all events, the duty is rebated. We could not build ships unless that was the case, as the British ships would simply be brought in here. I think that when war broke out there were on the Great Lakes ninety large cargo carriers which had been brought here from Great Britain. All of them went to sea when

war broke out, and possibly sixty or seventy per cent of them were destroyed by submarines, and many of the crews gave up their lives in the service of the Empire. The officers and men of the merchant marine of Canada have no need to be ashamed of their record during the war. I trust that the people of this country will support those who are endeavouring to keep alive the maritime traditions of our race. I can assure the minister that the manufacturers of this country and the farmers who need the ships to carry their products abroad will support him in any measures that he may take for seeing that this country is not divorced from shipping as it likely will be within six months or a year if we do not have shipping of our own. Trade will expand Iso rapidly and the scarcity of shipping will become so acute that foreign countries will control their ships just as the United States and Great Britain are doing now. The United States has fixed the freight rates between New York and every foreign port. Great Britain is controlling her ships in the same way, and Canada's voice is very small in the counsels of these nations when our trade comes into competition with theirs. If we are to compete in foreign markets we must have ships of our own, and we would not be progressive if we did not adopt this policy of establishing a merchant marine.

The largest number of men engaged there did not much exceed 3,000, and there are still, I understand, 900 men on the pay roll, about 2,000 having been demobilized. The cry among those who are still on is that demobilization is proceeding too slowly and that there is no occasion for keeping them there. They are doing nothing, and in letters I have received they assert that they are simply kept there by the officers as an excuse for the latter to retain themselves in office. The statement is broadly made both in the newspapers in Halifax and in the communications that were sent to me, that all the officers on the Nio:be, in the higher ranks at all events, are English naval officers who were loaned 'to the Canadian Government for this service, and that when they came to this country they were promoted in rank from what might be regarded as petty officers to a higher grade, with a consequent increase in wages, and, as it is remarked in these letters, promotion in social standing, and so on. It is asserted that they are having an excellent time and good pay and are just keeping it going in order that their salaries may be continued. The men appear to be highly dissatisfied and write me that they believe their time will be up on the 11th of this month, that

is, six months after the termination of hostilities, when tney are entitled to leave. I was anxious to bring this matter to the notice of the authorities to-day so that we would avoid if possible the disagreeableness and, to some extent, the disgrace of having any trouble among our men, and in order that the most effective and speedy action should be taken by the Government to meet any brewing difficulties among them. They have sent me a copy of a general order issued by W. Oswald Story, Admiral Superintendent of that service at Halifax. It reads:-
In view of the misunderstanding which appears to exist, with regard to demobilization, attention is called to the fact that ail officers and men are liable to serve for a period of six months after cessation of hostilities. As some officers and men will be required volunteers were called for, in order that, so far as1 possible, those retained might he volunteers, but it must be understood that others will also he required, if insufficient volunteer, and will be retained as necessary.
Those who do not volunteer to continue to serve will be demobilized after cessation of hostilities as thpir services can be spared.
W. Oswald Story, Admiral Superintendent.
November 23, 191>8.
The men in the service interpret this Order to mean that hostilities ceased on the 11th day of November. They had a contract to stay in the service until the cessation of hostilities and for six months thereafter. When the armistice was signed on the 11th of November, these men, it appears from the tenor of this Order, wanted to get away at once, and this Order was made then to make their position clear. They understood by it that those who volunteered were bound to remain for six months after the cessation of hostilities, or up to the 11th of this month, and they want to get away at that date. I have here copies of newspapers that are friendly to the Government-the Halifax Herald and the Halifax Evening Mail, both of them strong supporters of the Government, speaking editorially-I shall not take up the time of the Committee reading it-they sustain exactly what I have said. They put forth the same theory, that these officers are unnecessarily prolonging the time of demobilization. The Mail is jusit an evening edition of the Herald, both being owned by the same people, and both issues set forth, as an argument to show the unreasonableness of the time that is taken in dealing with these men, that 150,000 men have been brought home from England and disbanded and dealt with by the authorities in the military service.
While this has been done there are only 2,000 demobilized altogether and about 1,000 on the hands of the officers doing nothing, according to the report that comes to me.
I think it is quite proper for me to read a letter I received to-day:
Halifax, N.S., May 4, 1919.
Dear Sir:-I have been delegated on behalf of the Boys from the Lower Deck to direct a letter to you, asking you, if you would take up our case which is stated below, in the House of Commons.
We men have resolved, on or about the' 11th of May to discontinue our services in the "" Canadian Navy "" and demand that we be demobilized forthwith, on the grounds, that our contract as far as the Canadian Navy and Government is concerned, is completed, observing, that we have carried out our duties 6 months after the cessation of hostilities. We further base our claim on the General Order, which I enclose, dated November 23, 1918, ....
That is the general order that I read-

and signed by Admiral Storey. Will you, on our behalf ask in the House of Commons the following question: ""What date, after November 11, 1918, do the contracts, signed by the Canadian Naval Ratings become void? In the event of the men refusing duty after the 11th of May, what stand will he taken by the Government?""
The letters which I enclose, published by the Halifax Herald express the feeling of every Canadian sailor in the service. We have stood everything during the war, and when war ended, to our great surprise the Government had no policy formed, as to dealing with our demobilization. We have waited our six months, and even to-day they have not declared themselves in regard to the ultimate date of our demobilization. We are all anxious to get back into civilian life as soon as possible, in order to get re-established in our civilian occupations.
That is the substance of the complaint made by these men, together with what I have already stated. I think that it is not necessary to keep them there, and that the officers are simply making jobs for themselves. That is not my language; it is what is communicated to me by these men, and I think it is my duty to represent the matter to the Government so that such action may be taken as will prevent any difficulty between these men and their officers.
I trust that immediate action will be taken upon these facts, as I believe them to be facts. I would have some hesitation perhaps if I did not have exactly the same story in the form of an editorial signed by the editor of the Evening Mail. He puts his own name to the statements which appear in his paper, and I feel confident that a paper of the standing of the Evening Mail would not give its countenance to these , statements by publishing them if the editor did not believe they were true.

During the war, owing to the patriotic feeling of the country, people were not critical; you -could get pretty nearly anything that was asked for in 'the name of the war or for the purposes of the war. But the time has arrived when the people will be more critical, and if we continue war measures at a .time when there is no longer any war, there will be keener inquiry and more criticism. I do not object to the passing of the Act, but I think it is just as well that we should begin to adapt ourselves to the condition of peace which is happily upon us.

My hon. friend will understand that after a war of such long duration there must necessarily be a number of items subject to adjustment, and it will take considerable time before the transactions can be closed up. I said last night that 1 would make as comprehensive a statement as possible upon the occasion of the Budget speech with reference to the national debt of Canada, especially its increase during the war, and our estimated expenditures for the coming year, our borrowings of last year, and our proposed borrowings for the present year, and would aim generally to lay as fully before Parliament as I could the facts relating to our financial position, in which, I know, all members of the House and citizens of the country are specially interested at this time.
My hon. friend has referred to the state of exchange between Canada and the United States. It is quite unfavourable to Canada, almost to the extent of 3 per cent. The hon. gentleman is a business man and will not have failed to observe that exchange between Great Britain and the United States is still more unfavourable to Great Britain, approximating 5 per cent. It is not correct that we have an adverse balance of trade to-day, as stated by the hon. member. Our balance of trade is favourable and has been exceedingly so during the last two or three years of the war. All the products .that Canada is selling to-day outside of our own borders are being paid for by outside money, that is to say, by what we call technically, exchange. To ascertain a country's real exchange position the whole world position must be taken into account.
I stated last night that one reason why exchange was unfavourable was that by having to provide so much money here in Canada to pay for our products which, in normal times, would find outside money and thus redress our exchange, we neutralized for exchange purposes that amount of our exports. If Great Britain was able to find exchange outside of Canada, that is to

say credits in New York, or if she could buy in London exchange for our wheat, flour and other products which she purchased, our Neiw York exchange would speedily rectify itself.
My hon. friend referred to a matter that I do not desire to enter upon at any length to-night, but which has been discussed on more than one occasion in this House, and that is the action taken by the Dominion Government in regard to newsprint. He drew the inference that on account of that action our exchange was not as favourable as it might otherwise have been in the United States. My hon. friend is no doubt aware that the amount of newsprint consumed in Canada by Canadian publishers is only about eleven per cent of our entire output, and therefore, I submit that the regulation of the price in Canada with respect to that eleven per cent has not any vital hearing upon the question of exchange between Canada and the United States.
The action of the Government was taken, as my hon. friend knows, for the purpose of providing, in a very critical time, newsprint at reasonable rates to the Canadian publishers who were very hard hit by the war, especially during the first three years. I am quite satisfied that when the matter comes up for more extended discussion, as my hon. friend indicates that it may, I shall be able to carry the judgment of the House and the country in favour of the proposition that the action of the Government was well advised and in the national interest at the time it was taken. The control of newsprint has continued down to the present time; it will continue until the end of the war, and until, I think also, the Paper Tribunal, which has been created by the Government for the purpose of hearing an appeal from the Newsprint Commissioner, renders its decision. There was submitted to it the question of the price of newsprint for the period since-I am speaking from recollection-July 1 of last year. No Government likes to take, even in war time, any action by way of restriction. It is a very unpleasant thing to do. It is done only from considerations of national duty and the national interest, and these were the motives inducing the Government, in connection with newsprint, to put into effect the Orders in Council and regulations referred to by my hon. friend.
The action of the Government is not singular in that regard. I believe that in Norway, which was a neutral country, such action was taken quite early in the war.
	'
In the United States, which takes the largest portion of our newsprint production, there was regulation, as my hon. friend knows, of the price of newsprint. There is regulation in that country to-day. I think my hon. friend is scarcely fair in his criticism of the Government for taking that, what we regard, very necessary action. My hon. friend also referred *0 the regulations which were in effect some little time ago prohibiting the export of butter.

I would point out to him that, in 1914, when the war commenced, Parliament passed the War Measures Act, which practically devolved upon the Government the legislative powers of Parliament. It was an extraordinary power, implying great confidence, and I have always felt that the Government should exercise that power keeping that fact in mind. Speaking generally with regard to the War Measures Act, I believe that almost more than any other single thing except the patriotism and courage of our soldiers, that Act enabled Canada to achieve the degree of success in the war which she did achieve. I have heard men in the United States-where the system was not nearly so flexible until they had been in the war for some time, when the entire executive and, I think, legislative power was vested in the President-refer to this War Measures Act and the extraordinary power that it gave to the Government to deal quickly with questions as they arose. It would be quite impossible to provide in Estimates, or by legislation in advance, for all the multitudinous cases arising during

the war; and this War Measures Act, while it did give the Government extraordinary power and was concurred in by the Opposition, and, as I say, implied the reposing of great confidence in the Government- which for my part I have always recognized and gladly acknowledged-enabled this country to do what it could by no means otherwise have -attempted to do in the carrying on of the war. I wish to say that, and I would like to draw my hon. friend's attention to the powers devolved upon the Government by that Act-powers which would never have been given, and never should have been given, except in war time.
The War Appropriation Acts of the past two years and this War Demobilization Act are intended to give the Government power to deal, as to expenditure, with all matters arising out of the w-ar. It is very wide, I admit. I am a strong believer in the Government bringing down estimates in detail rather than in blanket votes, -showing as far as possible the purpose for which the expenditure is to be made. That is a sound principle, in ordinary times -at least. This year I took up in my office the question of what amount we should provide in this Demobilization Bill. The instructions I gave were that the estimates of my own department and of all other departments to which the request was transmitted should contain . practically all the items we could specify, and that the Demobilization Bill should cover only the war gratuity, demobilization expenditure, and other items that could not be specified with accuracy in an estimate. I do not know how far we have succeeded in doing that, but we appreciate the confidence expressed in the vote and will endeavour to administer it as trustees should.

It has also been drawn to my attention that there is a difficulty in the province of Quebec in regard to trustees' deeds; they do not operate in that province quite in the same way as they do in other provinces. It
4 p.m. seems that liens, mortgages, hypothecs and the like are not removed by trustee's deed and a clear title cannot be conveyed. Several prominent members of the Bar of the province of Quebec have directed my attention to this fact and have suggested an amendment so that we might give to a trustee's deed in that province the same effect as is now given to a sheriff's deed. Personally I see no objection to inserting a clause to that effect, if it is the desire of the Committee. I move that the following be added as subsection (3):
All sales of real estate made by the trustee shall vest in the purchaser all the legal and equitable estate of the debtor therein.
That will be the general clause. Then I move that the following be added as subclause (a) of subsection (2):
(a) In the province of Quebec a sale of real estate made by the trustee shall have the same effect as to mortgages, hypothecs or privileges then existing thereon as if the same had been made by a sheriff in the said province under a writ of execution issued in the ordinary course, and the title conveyed by such sale in the said province shall have equal validity with a title created by sheriff's sale and the conveyance of the trustee shall have the same effect as a sheriff's deed in the said province.

Has he had any correspondence with the consumers and farmers who have to purchase this fertilizer or with any farmer's association?

(Mr. A. K. MACLEAN: I cannot say that there has been any consultation with the consumer. I would like to impress upon my hon. friend that the tax is merely upon the brand. It is not $8, $16, or $24 per ton. The manufacturer may sell 100,000 tons of a certain brand but he will only be charged $24. It will not afford any substantial proportion of the. cost to the department of the administration of the Act. I do not think it is a burdensome tax or that it will meet with any opposition from the consumer.
Mr. MeCOIG: This seems to be a very simple matter to take up the time of the House with. As other matters come before the House, as commissions and officers are appointed, the department itself provides for defraying the expense, but when, it comes to such an important question as fertilizer is to the producers of this country and also to the consumers, it does seem ridiculous that a little cent or two cent tax has to be collected to defray the expenses of the officer who administers the Act. I do not see why the department does not assume the responsibility itself and pay the expenses of the administration of the Act instead of having some officer pulling a cent or two cent tax or a hundred pounds out of the purchaser, of the fertilizer and administering the Act at his expense. In the department there are men who are being paid by the Government to look after matters of this kind without penalizing the consumer by collecting a cent on every hundred pounds or twenty cents on every ton. They will have to keep a lot of bookkeepers to keep track of the administration of this Act and the distribution of the stamps. It is going to involve a lot of unnecessary expense.

I have given a good deal of thought to it, having regard to the discussion which took place on the question of absconding debtors. It will be remembered that at the last meeting of the Committee considerable discussion took place as to what provision we should insert. I_find that the dictionary meaning of the term "" abscond "" is:
To remove one's self from the jurisdiction of the court; to place one's self in hiding.
In my judgment, and it has been confirmed by the conferences I have had with some very prominent lawyers both from

Ontario and Quebec, I think the section would be improved if we inserted the words "" from Canada "" after the word "" abscond "". The section would then read: "" Abscond from Canada."" It must be remembered that the Act has Dominion wide application. The mere fact that a debtor goes from one province to another would hardly in my judgment constitute absconding; he is still within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, and he is not in hiding.
Therefore I move:
To amend! section 55 by adding the words ""from Canada"" after the word ""abscond"" in the twelfth line of the said section at p. 44 of the Bill.
It will then read:
If, after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition against him, it appears to the court that there is probable reason for believing that he has absconded, or Us about to abscond from Canada, with a view of avoiding payment of the debt in respect of which the bankruptcy petition was filed, or of avoiding appearance to any such petition or of avoiding examination in respect of his affairs or of otherwise avoiding, delaying or embarrassing proceedings in bankruptcy against him.

We have not at the present time a uniform law in all the provinces in regard to this matter. In the province of Ontario in case of assignment we allow the landlord one year of past due rent as a preference, and also three months future rent. I understand that in the province of Quebec the landlord can legally claim one year's future rent, and I think varying sums are permitted in the other provinces. The Committee which had this Bill in charge last year paid a great deal of attention to this section. It was urged that if we interfered with landlords' rights landlords would insist on stiffer terms when leases were negotiated, and that the rent probably would become payable in advance. However, a body representing almost thirty thousand retail merchants of this country, who ara the great tenant class among the merchants, appeared before the Committee and specifically approved the enactment. So far as they are concerned they are not afraid of the terms which may be imposed upon them by landlords in the future. This section provides that when bankruptcy proceedings take place the landlord's right

to a preference over other creditors shall be for rent for the last three months of the term, and it will be a first charge upon the estate. A landlord can always protect himself; he does not need to let his rent get three months in arrear. He has special privileges which other creditors do not possess; he can distrain the goods of his tenant and can realize at almost any moment. He is negligent if he allows his rent to become more than three months in arrear; and for the protection of the general creditors the Committee thought that three months was a fair and reasonable amount of rent to allow as a preference over the claims of other creditors. It was with that view that this section was drawn as it now appears. Of course, he is not deprived from claiming for all the rent due, but for anything beyond the three months he can only claim as an ordinary creditor. The Committee thought that was pretty fair treatment for the landlord, and it would be a good thing to make it uniform throughout Canada.
We must bear in mind that landlords have always been creatures whom our legislation and British legislation have favoured from time immemorial. Our present law of landlord and tenant is a relic of the feudal system and was made when landlords sat in Parliament, but tenants did not. Up to fifty or sixty years ago the law was so onesided in favour of the landlord that it was practically a disgrace. Gradually the hardships have been ameliorated by legislation; but to-day in Ontario a landlord is permitted too large a claim, in my humble judgment, when he is allowed one year of arrears and three months advance rent in the case'of assignment. I do not know what view the Committee will take of the clause, but in my judgment it is a very fair one.

If she has an estate separate from it-hat of her husband why should she not receive the same consideration as lin the case of any other separate estate? For instance take the case of a married woman who has inherited property from her parents, which is entirely separate from the estate of her husband, and has advanced money to him to carry on his business.
I fail to see the wisdom or the fairness of the change. I think the wife is just as legally entitled as any outsider to rank as a creditor of that estate. Her money and her property are her own in that case, and she makes the loan as a purely business transaction so far as she and her husband are concerned. It seems to me, not looking at it from the legal aspect, but from the ordinary business aspect, that the woman should have the protection of the court for her estate as against her husband, and that he on his side should have similar protection against his wife.

kinds of manipulation and of wrong-doing in regard to financial matters, and particularly as they pertain to creditors, than the relationship that exists between husband and wife. I call my hon. friend's attention in the first place to the fact that this section applies only to the future. So that husbands and wives will know after this Bill becomes law that if they loan money one to the other for business or other purposes they are taking chances under this section, and their claims may be postponed to those of otljier creditors. The reason for the section is that in the majority of cases of assignment a husband or a wife prefers a large claim against the estate. It may be that the claim is perfectly valid in most cases, but there are many cases in which the claim: is decidedly invalid and should not be allowed to prevail as against the creditors. Such fictitious claims are so easily made and so hard to defeat that you must in some way protect ordinary creditors against them. To do so we must enact something such as we have attempted by section 48. That section has been largely used in England, and it will be used in this country, too, in future, I am sure. Case after case comes up when not only does the husband or the wife prefer a claim as a creditor for money loaned, but in addition a claim for wages. Those claims may be proper enough, but in future, if this Bill becomes law husbands and wives must take notice that such claims will only be paid after the claims of other creditors. If with that notice staring them in the face they allow their claims for wages to accumulate they will have to take the consequences. It is in order to defeat the large number of fictitious claims which are presented in cases of bankruptcy, that it has been found necessary, I think, in every civilized country which has a bankruptcy law to include a clause of this kind. If it had a retroactive effect I would not support it as I do; but it only applies to the future.

I object to the application of Part I of the Bill to non-traders. This is the first time that there has been brought into the House of Commons of Canada a Bankruptcy Act which includes non-traders in its application. The Bankruptcy Act of 1875, which was repealed in 1879, and the Bill introduced in 1897 by Mr. Fortin, who is now judge of the Superior Court, did not apply to non-traders. I have gone carefully over legislation on bankruptcy of different countries, and I believe the only countries in which Bankruptcy Acts apply to nontraders are Great Britain and the United States. In Prance, Belgium and other countries, the Acts do not apply to nontraders. My principal objection to the extension of the law to non-traders is this: The enforcement of a bankruptcy law is a serious matter; it means a searching investigation into the affairs of a man by his creditors. It is encroaching on private rights. It allows the creditors to find out private secrets of all kinds and, in fact, it is a grave violation of property rights. The debtor ceases to have charge of his business and his creditors take his place and as Thallier says in his study on bankruptcy, only the most important reasons can justify such an action. The necessi-
[Mr. Jacobs.)
ties of trade afford Parliament an opportunity of adopting such measures, although this is clearly odious to private rights. Credit requires such legislation, such violation of the liberty of the proprietor, and business cannot dispense with it. In what position would a trader be if he could not obtain credit from his banker or other creditors? That is the reason for a bankruptcy law. The law should give the banker or other creditors the assurance that if the debtor should fail, a trustee will be named who will take charge of his assets for the benefit of all creditors, present or absent. Otherwise, without this law there would be no protection for the creditors in contingencies against which no one can be safeguarded. In business relations many creditors now reside far away from their debtors, while other debtors are more easily accessible. If the insolvency law were abolished, creditors living near the debtor and being consequently more in touch with him than those who are distant, would seize his assets first, to the prejudice of those living far away; and without insolvency legislation there would be this further effect, that only cash sales would be made. There would be no more credit, and in consequence practically no trade. This consideration, however, does not, I submit,
. apply to non-traders. The judge, the doctor, the lawyer, or the professional man lives on his income or his salary, and has no justification in living beyond his means. His profession should preclude the necessity of speculations inherent to trade, and if he obtains credit it is not on the guarantee of any assets but merely on his personal promise to pay, and his creditors will wait until he receives his income. Unlike the case of the trader, to whom credit is a business necessity, society is not interested whether the man who receives a salary gets credit or not. Admitting that the non-trader contracts debts, it is highly improbable that his creditors will either be so numerous or most of them so far distant that some living in proximity to the debtor will reap all the benefits to the prejudice of the others. Besides that, there is a constitutional viewpoint to consider. I will grant for a moment that the law of bankruptcy in regard to the trader, even if it touches civil rights and property, as it necessarily does, is within the province of the federal power. But I contend that subsection 21 of section 91 of The British North America Act evidently conferred such power, because it pertained to the trade and commerce legislation, which is exclusively within the purview of the Federal

Government. I am sure, however, that the intention of the legislators in reference to subsection 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act, which gives the province control of legislation in regard to property and civil rights, was not to extend the bankruptcy legislation to anything outside trade and commerce, and it would undoubtedly go beyond their intention if this law -were made applicable to nontraders. I therefore move, seconded by Mr. Jacobs:
That subsection 1 of clause 8 be amended by striking out all the words after the first line of said section, beiing line 21 of nage 8, and substituting the following words: "" non traders.""

point upon which there might be considerable argument. There is no doubt that in the Insolvency Bill of 1375 an attempt was made to confine the operation of that Act to traders, and one of the objections to the Act always was that it was so confined. It is contended that there is a large class of non-traders who are 'debtors and should be treated as ordinary citizens of the country, amenable to the ordinary laws, whether of bankruptcy or otherwise. Another difficulty is to give anything like an adequate definition of the word ""trader."" The definition in the Act of 1875 was certainly defective, but it covers almost two pages of typewritten matter, defining almost all classes of business enterprise we know in Canada. But still it would not suffice for a definition at the present time, because we have a great many avenues of trade and commerce today that were not in existence then. So that it would be extremely difficult to define just who were and who were not traders. In England the experience has been that the Act should apply generally to all classes. I think that about fifty years ago, in the sixties, the Act was limited to traders, but after an experience of some years, that Act was extended, and the British and the United States Acts to-day both apply to all classes of the people in regard not only to obligations created by the Act, but to the benefits which are conferred upon the honest debtor in the way of obtaining his discharge. I know, however, that in France, Belgium, and one or two other continental countries the bankruptcy Acts are still confined to traders. Having heard from as many public commercial bodies as I could upon the subject, and having heard a long discussion in the Special Committee by a great many interested classes, I concluded, and the Committee concluded, that this Bill, in order to have a fair chance of
operation, should be made general in its application. For instance, it was urged by the very large association of retail merchants which has a membership in Canada of some 30,000, that it was unfair to them to put all the imposition on their shoulders and allow them none of the benefits. As it was pointed out that one of the great debtor classes was professional people, the question was asked, why should they not be included? and the Committee took that view. My o-wn view is that if you are to give the Act a fair chance of success you must extend it beyond the trading classes. If it should prove to be burdensome or to be an undue imposition upon the people, within a year of its operation there would be a demand for its repeal. But I do not think it will be burdensome. On the contrary, I think it will be a great benefit to both the debtor and the creditor classes, and I certainly support the present generality of its terms.

It is said that the farmer is very much more subject to unforeseen accidents than any other class of people in the community. He may be solvent to-day, with bright prospects for the coming year, and when everything looks promising he may experience a disastrous accident. He could be put into bankruptcy by reason of his inability during a season to meet maturing liabilities, and he might be sold out and his farm taken from him. But in the ordinary course, if he were given another year or two, he would have big crops and be on his feet again and be re-established. He might be the victim of natural causes beyond his control, and for that reason the Act was not made to apply either to the farmer or to the small wage-earner.

The advisory hoard shall have power to prescribe what shall be deemed a sufficient medication of medicines containing alcohol in excess of two and a half per cent to make them unfit for use as beverages.
There is a considerable agitation in all the provinces in connection with the sale of patent medicines and the fact that they are too high in alcoholic content. Any patent medicines containing over two and one half per cent of alcohol must be approved by the Advisory Council before they can be sold. I wish to amend this section by inserting after the word ""registration"" on the second line the following:
Or any medicine containing more than two and a half per cent of alcohol or containing any of the drugs mentioned in or added to the schedule of the Act.
We are not amending the schedule, which contains a list of dangerous drugs which can be used only with the consent or permission of the Advisory Council. Two and a half per cent is fixed by reason of the fact that in no province is that alcoholic content in drugs or patent medicines prohibited.
I wish to amend the subsection further by striking out the words ""essential formula and composition of such medicine"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words ""quantity of alcohol or of such drug or drugs contained in such medicine."" This will put the Advisory Board in a position to determine whether the alcoholic content is in excess of two and a half per cent, and will also give information as to the drug or drugs contained in such medicine. The section as it now stands requires the disclosure of the essential formula and com-



position of the medicine. It was deemed possible that that would be unfair, because it would compel the proprietor to disclose all knowledge relating to his property.

Mr. JOHN A. STEWART: The remarks of the hon. gentleman (Mr. Steele) are very likely to create a misapprehension in the minds of the members of the Committee. When he states, as he has done, the volume of the goods manufactured the inference might be drawn that that volume of business comes under the provisions of the license which has to be taken out under the Bill. But under the provision of the Proprietary and Patent Medicines Act the manufacturer of a patent or proprietary medicine has two courses open to him. He may put upon the label of his goods the formula of the contents. If he does not do that he must register it as a proprietary or patent medicine. The only preparations which will be subject to this license, as I understand it, are those which are registered. Now a very small proportion of the business referred to by the hon. member (Mr. Steele) represents a registered business. In addition to those patent or proprietary medicines which do not contain the formula upon the label and which come under the license, there is a /very large volume of preparations which are manufactured for dispensing-preparations which are manufactured for the druggist and dispensed upon the prescription of physicians. All that business does not come under the necessity for a license, as I understand the Bill. It would therefore be a very great mistake to imagine that anything more than a small proportion of the
[Mr. A. K. Maclean!

most important clauses of this Bill. With regard to the new section 6, it will strike every member of the Committee that if a drug is "" dangerous for infants under one year old "" it is dangerous also for children a year and a half old. The most important question in connection with the manufacture and sale of patent medicines is that which relates to the use of soothing or calmative syrups for children. The use of these preparations in 'Canada has assumed such formidable proportions that we cannot ignore the subject. What they contain is well known to the medical profession, to pharmacists generally and to the better-educated class of the population. They contain opium and the derivatives of opium)-

that is, morphine, codeine, heroine, the-baine and other narcotics. If the good Canadian mothers were cognizant of the ravages caused among their dear ones by the use of these preparations, they would immediately and entirely abstain from administering them to their children. They are induced 'to use them by the alluring descriptions on the labels. It may be argued that you should not interfere with a well-established trade in Canada. But what is the importance, I ask, of the advantages reaped by manufacturers of these patent medicines as compared with the necessity of preserving 'the health of those beings who to-morrow will constitute the very -essence of the Canadian population? It may be known to some-it is not to me- that heartless mothers, knowing what they do, administer calmative syrups for the purpose of soothing their children.
But it is well known to every one that, for instance, in the absence of the mother, an unscrupulous servant may administer those syrups in large quantities, and the mental and physical consequences cannot be measured. Therefore, I intend to move an amendment to section G, reserving for myself the right to express my opinion further on clause 7. I am not going to adhere to the wording of this amendment; if it be found that an amendment suggested toy some member of the committee or by the minister may be more effective, easier of administration or of carrying out, I am ready to accept such suggestion. I move to amend clause 1 of the present Bill by striking out the proposed section 6 and replacing it by the following:
6. The manufacture, importation or Bale ot all proprietary or patent medicines containing opium or its derivatives or any derivatives of coal tar intended for administration to children under fifteen years, are prohibited.

I am quite sure, after having discussed this matter with some of the medical authorities, that many of the subjects fit for our asylums or even for our jails, were the early victims of these soothing syrups, because all their troubles in life can be traced to the use of opium and narcotics generally. The other day, a very distinguished doctor from Montreal told me that he could point out on the street young men of twenty or twenty-five years of age whose demeanour showed the use of narcotics when they were infants. It is admitted to-day that it is a great misfortune that we should allow any of this poison to be served by fathers or mothers to their children. Many associations of

ladies, doctors, members of all sects and denominations, have taken a special interest in what is called baby welfare. The other day I received from the Baby Welfare Committee of Montreal a letter which has doubtless been sent to the minister, This letter informs me that the following resolution was adopted unanimously at a meeting held at Montreal a few days ago:
Whereas, there is a Bill to amend the Proprietary or Patent medicine Act now before the House of Commons, sponsored by Hon. A. K. Maclean, which, in the experience of the medical adviser and ohild welfare specialists connected with the various units of the Baby Welfare Committee of Montreal, does not safeguard the moral or physical entity of the young child, inasmuch as under section 6, of the proposed Act, opium-containing medication is readily procurable for any infant or child: and, inasmuch, as the Act applies solely to opium in section 6, without reference to its more dangerous habit forming derivatives, as morphine, heroin, etc., being fully considered.
Therefore, be it resolved that this committee go strongly on record as disapproving of section 6 and 7, as at present constituted, and that we urge the manufacture and sale of opium, or its derivatives, in medication be absolutely forbidden in Canada, as not being conducive to the moral or physical betterment of our younger citizenship. In default of this recommendation being adopted, that a conspicuous skull and crossbones emblem, with the word ""Poison"" distinctly printed across the container, be employed as a deterring influence upon the promiscuous distribution of this unnecessary class of narcotic medication, destined for popular sale and consumption among infants and children in Canada.
I would not only put this sinister emblem of a skull and cross-bones on the bottle containing this poisonous substance for the children, but bar the substance completely from the homes of Canada. It is a crime to allow those soothing syrups, made up of opium or other narcotics, to be exposed for sale in our drug stores or be sold by quack doctors travelling throughout the country. We have already too many subjects in our asylums, too many juvenile delinquents in our jails who have acquired their bad habits by the use early in life of those so-called medicaments. I hope the Committee will accept the wise amendment and that we shall not hear any more of those soothing syrups which are nothing less than poison.

I am sorry only that it does not go further. What is not good for a child of fourteen years of age is not good for a child of sixteen years of age. Had this amendment not been moved, or should it be rejected by the Committee, I would suggest another amendment, that a sub-clause be inserted in
clause 7 to the effect that no proprietary or patent medicine should be manufactured, imported, exposed or offered for sale in Canada if it contains opium or any of its derivatives. I would exclude all patent medicines containing opium from sale or importation, whether administered to children under fifteen years of age or to adults over fifteen years of age. They should certainly he prohibited for children. The facts presented to the Committee by the hon. members for Beauce (Mr. Beland) and Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) to-ndght clearly indicate the views of the people who are engaged in baby welfare work, the people who, perhaps, above all others, are qualified to speak of the results of the administration of medicines containing opium to our little children. No doubt opium serves a good purpose sometimes, but too often, in fact in the great majority of cases, it is used to sooth a child suffering from some ailment which should be corrected if the child is going to enjoy good health. It covers up the real ailment affecting the child, keeps the child quiet, and if this goes on long enough, the child will no doubt be found in a moribund condition from the disease from which it is suffering, assisted possibly by the doses of opium. There is another effect which it has on the child, and which, I think, is admitted by all who have given the matter study, namely, that upon the brain. The brain of a child undergoes its greatest development in the first six months of life.
The brain of an adult weighs on an average from 1,400 to 1,500 grammes, and that of a baby six months old on an average about 1,000 grammes. Yet, during these six months of infant life, there are thousands of babies being fed daily on these remedies, call them what you choose, whose chief ingredients are opium or its derivatives, and the development of the brain of a child so fed is interfered with to the extent to which opium is administered to it. The chances of children fed that way for growing up healthy both physically and intellectually are greatly reduced. We not only think that opium should not be sold indiscriminately for administration to children, but that, in Ontario at least, it should not he sold indiscriminately for the use of even adults, who experience considerable difficulty in purchasing opium in any drug store in Ontario. The purchaser of opium has to sign the poison book and observe all the precautions with which the law surrounds its sale. Every person realizes that it is not in the interest of even adults that * they should be permitted to buy opium

freely and use it as they please. That being so, why should they be allowed to purchase it indiscriminately and with the greatest freedom in the form of patent medicines? I think we should exclude it entirely in patent medicines, and when people want opium they should procure it under proper supervision, duly observing the precautions and restrictions which the law imposes. It will be observed that the first sub-clause prohibits the importation and sale of any medicine containing cocaine or any of its salts or preparation. Now, we all know that cocaine so used is not likely to be nearly so injurious as opium, and if we_ prohibit cocaine the arguments in favour of the prohibition of opium are very much strengthened. For these reasons I certainly would vote for the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Beauce. If, however, it is not considered satisfactory to the Committee, I would move the amendment which I have suggested, that the entire importation, manufacture and sale of any patent medicines containing opium or its derivatives be prohibited. I believe that now is the time for us to take this step. The very fact that liquor is being restricted in its sale is an argument for us at this early date to protect the people against the indiscriminate use of opium and more injurious drugs which too often will be substituted for the liquor that is prohibited.

raised by the hon. member for Temiscouata is that the present Bill which was introduced and passed in the Senate before being submitted to the House of Commons contains clauses involving public taxation in the form of license fees and therefore could not originate in the Senate and must be rejected by the House of Commons'. It is true that section 53 of the British North America Act expressly provides:
Bills for appropriating any part of the public revenue, or for imposing any tax or impost [DOT] shall originate in the House of Commons.

But there are many precedents where Bills of this nature have been passed in the Senate and the money clauses embodied in -the Bills have been later submitted to a Committee of the Whole House. Bourinot at page 493 says:
It is frequently found convenient to introduce bills involving public expenditure in the Senate, and in such a case the money clauses are embodied in the bill as presented, in order
to make it more intelligible	These clauses
are always considered in a previous Committee by the Commons, and regularly referred to the Committee of the Whole on the bill.
The same practice applies to Bills imposing any tax or impost and should be followed in all cases when the House of Commons insists upon its rights and privileges. These rights and privileges are laid down in rule 78, but rule 87 provides that in order to expedite the business of Parliament, the House will not always insist on -the privilege of laying aside a Bill sent from the Senate because it imposes a tax, an impost or a penalty. The House of Commons undoubtedly had the right and privilege of laying aside -this Bill until it had been preceded by a resolution which would have been considered by a Committee of the Whole House, but the proper -time for -the exercise of this privilege was when the order was called for the second reading of this Bill. It was read a second time without objection and is now under -consideration in Committee. A committee has no power to refuse the consideration of a Bill which has been submitted to it by the -House, and I must therefore declare that the point of order is not now well taken.

It does not appear to me that in this age one legitimate excuse can be offered for putting up in a patent medicine any form of opium to be dispensed by the laity to children. The proposal seems to be absolutely contrary to the rapidly growing practice in the medical profession which is to eliminate it as far as possible, in treating diseases not only of infants but of adults. We in the medical profession know that from time to time an emergency call comes from some home where an infant has, through ignorance or other cause, taken an overdose of opium, laudanum, paregoric, or some form of the derivatives of opium; and many of us have seen lives pass out of this world owing to the fact that medicines of that nature were easily procurable and were more or less daily used in the home as household remedies. Now the object of this Bill is to protect the public; it could have none other. It does look to me, I must say, as though the interests had not been very far away when this Bill was drawn-not only as regards the present hut with respect to other' succeeding clauses. This measure has all the earmarks of a Bill which'had, I was going to say, been commercialized, or the earmarks of a commercial transaction. We must not get away from the fact that our object is to pass a Bill that will protect the public. I do not think any professional man or any layman can adduce a single argument to-day that will justify putting any derivative of opium into the hands of the public to be administered to children without knowing its nature, because that is what this Bill means. If you are going to give the public any form of medicine containing any of the derivatives of opium for goodness sake let it be indicated on the bottle so that the purchaser can read it and know they are administering some form of a drug which is very dangerous and very injurious. Opium, of course, has its uses, but I think I am within the mark when I say that practically the only great use it has is to alleviate pain; all other uses are detrimental to health and are absolutely dangerous to children.

If you prohibit the manufacture and sale of them at once you may be striking at what was at one time a perfectly lawful business, and I should like to think over what the likely effect of the prohibition would be.

Since this House has assembled I have been asked a number of times to make changes in the rooms in this building. Such changes are not very great and I give them only as an illustration. It takes men and material to make those changes, and, so far as I know, they have all been granted. With the great congestion of civil servants in the last three or four years-and it has oeen great-a staff gets so big that it cannot occupy its premises and other premises must be provided for it ana it has to be moved. There always must be changes. This is like a man moving into a new house-no man ever moved into a house in his life but his wife wanted some papering done or something else; she wanted a change of some kind. That is the way witu civil servants-they want change and one has to have a staff to provide for such changes, and we have a staff of 157 men. I must, say I think those men are pretty busy most of the time. Sometimes I wonder if it would not be possible to get a better system than we have in regard to the changing of staffs; but with the congestion that we have had to contend with in the last year and a half we have done the best we could, and I do not see the possibility of any improvement until the Dominion of Canada owns its own buildings. I do not believe one-half of our staff is housed in our own buildings to-day, and even when the new Hunter building is completed, as I hope it -will be in July or August next, still nearly one-half of the staff will be housed in rented buildings. And every time we make a change in the occupation of those buildings or any portion of them it costs money to move the staffs, and something must always be done, such as the buying of new furniture. Civil servants are just like other human beings; they want things and they usually get them. I can give no other explanation. I have no doubt at all -that in this Committee there are a dozen men who could take those 157 men, if they could deal with them as hired men, and put competent foremen

over them, and who would get more work out of them than the country is getting. But I cannot stand .over them myself. In the last year and a half those men have been hired and they have been fired, if necessary, entirely by the superintendent in charge of them. No man, excepting the clerk of works, has anything to say as to who shall go on that staff; he has an absolutely free hand. I have talked the matter over with him many times; I have found fault that those men are not giving as much service as^ they should give; but he assures me they are, and unless I can find time to go out and supervise them personally, I do not see how I am going to change conditions. I want to treat the Committee fairly and tell them exactly t'he situation. I think a change should be made; I think our staff is too big, but now these men want an eight-hour day. They want nearly everything except work.

That contract expires on the 1st of June. There have been a number of conferences between the city of Ottawa and a committee of the Government as to the terms of the renewal of the contract. The Mayor of Ottawa published a very exhaustive statement in January last setting forth his contention as to what the Government should pay, the amount he fixes being about $800,000 a year. We had a meeting before Parliament met and a great many since, and finally, representing the Committee, I made an offer of $150,000 a year to the Ottawa Improvement Commission for the next ten years-$100,000 a year to go to the city to cover all services performed by the city for the Government, and the Government to relinquish to the city the right of taxing civil servants upon their incomes. For a great many years there has been an arrangement by which the city of Ottawa has not taxed the incomes of civil servants by reason of amounts which the Government has been paying to the city. I have taken the ground that it is none of our business. The civil servant resident in the city is an ordinary citizen and should pay his taxes the same as any other man. In my proposal we relinquish in favour of the city the right of taxing civil servants. The city think they can raise $57,000 a year from income taxes, but my opinion is they should get $75,000 or $80,000 a year under a proper administration of the law. Taking the city's figure it would mean that instead of $150,000 going to the 'Commission there would be a sum of $307,000. The city claim that we should pay on the basis of taxation.

There would be an actual increase of $135,000 a year paid by the Government. Under the British North America Act, Government property is not taxable, and the city of Ottawa claim that because of this fact we should pay them an amount representing what the taxes ordinarily ought to be. Of course, we cannot admit that, but there is one matter with which I have a great deal of sympathy. One of the most antediluvian laws regarding water or any public utility that I have ever heard of in my life exists in Ottawa. A man pays $2, I think, on the first $1,000 valuation of his property, and after that pays a greater rate on every other $1,000. And you pay that no matter whether you use water or not, or whether you have half a dozen bathrooms or none at all; and even if it is a vacant lot you pay the same water rate. They say that a fair valuation of Government property in Ottawa would be about $20,000,000, and that therefore we should pay water rates according to this valuation. I say that we should pay water rates according to the number of thousand gallons used, and I have offered to the city of Ottawa to put a meter on every service in the city and pay a fair meter rate, and that if we were not able to agree on a fair rate we could leave the matter to arbitration. We are also using their sewers to a certain extent, and pay a certain amount for that. They say we should pay one-fifth of the total maintenance charges of the sewers, but we have not agreed to that. My opinion is that all public utilities, whether used by the Government or by private individuals, should be metered; in other words, that a man should pay for what he consumes, no more and no less. But the city says: No, we should pay for all our services on the basis of their method of taxation and upon their valuation of our pro'perty. I think we shall agree in the end. I am of opinion that there is a lot of ordinary politics in it, and no doubt in the next fortnight the city will accept the offer we have made them, which I think is a generous one.

The members might occupy the apartments for the period of the session, or probably for the year, if they cared to, and could pay rent to the Government.

manner in which the hon. member for Ottawa (Mr. Fripp) has discussed the matter. I realize that it is a matter somewhat personal to him and one which is of interest to his constituents. I think I have approached it in the fair spirit of the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and that I have even gone very much farther because I realize that the city has grown larger and that the world has advanced in ten years. Whereas Sir Wilfrid Laurier made an arrangement for the payment of $100,000 to the commission, I have offered $150,000 a year, and whereas he made an arrangement for $15,000 to go to the city, I have offered $100,000 and the right to tax the Civil Service which will represent about $50,000 or $75,000. It seems to me that, if you are going to make comparisons, I certainly have not been less generous than was the gentleman who has been referred to.
I do not want to discuss it any further than is necessary but I want to state to my hon. friend that the remarks which I made about the work done by employees were made from personal experience and knowledge, and not from hearsay. Of course, I have not had an opportunity of watching these men in a great proportion of their work, but I have had an opportunity of seeing With my own eyes certain things in the year and a half that I have been connected with the department, and I want to tell him that I would not feed some of these men for what they are doing. I would not have them on my premises at all. Why, the Speaker of the House told me only yesterday that he had a lot of these men repairing a room for him-one little room that a man would paint in one-half or three-quarters of a day. Yet six or seven men spent four or five days on the work. Wherever you go it is the same thing.

I understand that the Government carries its own insurance, or rather it does not carry insurance on its property. But the Government is responsible not only to itself and its employees but to the city in which its buildings are situated, and if a fire occurred through the negligence of the Government or its employees as regards defective wiring, if the ruling of inspectors is to be a guide in this matter, the Government would be responsible. If the Government are responsible, ll should like to know who would be the one that would be considered guilty in this connection under an enactment passed here a few weeks ago, to amend thp Criminal Code respecting the prevention * of fires. One section of the Bill says:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who, by negligence, causes any fire which occasions loss of life or loss of property.

I have been in customs houses in small cities where the building was large enough for a city five times its size. The Government might do well from an economical standpoint to have an independent inspector look over these buildings with a view to seeing if they could not find space for more departments of public service than those for which they are now used.

We have adopted the policy for the last year and a half that as these leases fall due we renew them for not later than the first of May. 1920, and in many cases not later than next December. The reason is this: The Hunter building will be completed, we hope, in July and certainly in August. That will provide about 140,000 square feet of floor space, and will house a great many civil servants now accommodated' in other parts of the city. But as there are some new departments being established, such as the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, the Land Settlement Board and the Income Tax office, the idea is to have a general rearrangement of the offices of the different departments when the Hunter building is finished. We have rented the whole of what is called the Rea or Daly building of which we get possession on the 1st of July. So that in July or by the 1st of August we hope to be able to make a re-arrangement by which we shall have each department in one place. I am sorry to say that two important departments will still be distributed in sections in different places around the city, but we are making very short term leases and hope within the next year and a half, at the outside, to get rid of a great many buildings now under lease and to reduce to quite an extent the amount of rental paid in Ottawa.

minister considered the unit system in the organization of Government offices to conserve space, and do away with so many partitions and doors in the buildings? It seems to me, in going through the departments as they exist at the present time, that one of the great difficulties is that the buildings were never designed as office buildings. Looking at the Hunter building from the outside it does seem to me to be the first approach to a successful modern office building that has ever been designed in connection with the Government service in any part of Canada. If it is carried out on that system it will not only conserve space but it will ultimately result in reducing the cost of the entire office staff.

I agree that this is the first attempt that has been made in Ottawa to have a real office building. The building is constructed on the unit basis. There are nine floors all practically alike. The only difference is that there is a well in the centre 100 x 50 feet. The building is 200 x 150 feet. That gives a row of offices all around the position of the well 50 feet wide. There is an 8-foot passageway which leads between two 20-foot offices, one on the outside and one on the inside. The great long corridors have been divided up according to the necessities of the departments intending to use them. Some of the space may be divided up into rooms 10 x 12 and in other cases there will be rooms from 30 to 50 feet long. We have consulted several departments which are going to use the different floors and have divided and partitioned the space according to the arrangements of these departments.
As to the future, I think I suggested on .a former occasion that it would well repay any member of the House of Commons to take a forenoon, go to Mr. Ewart's office and see the models which he is preparing for the new building which we all hope in the not-too-far-distant future to see erected on the expropriated area on Wellington street. That idea is being carried out there exclusively. We propose to adopt the unit system in .so far as the unit system can be applied to that building. The first unit will contain the Supreme Court room, and after that there will be a series of office buildings practically all built upon the

same general plan to carry out the idea that my hon. friend suggests.

I suppose that there is no clause in any Bankruptcy Bill or any assignment and preferences -act which causes as much trouble to the bar, the public and the courts as the question raised in section 31 of the present Bill. It is drawn with the purpose of avoiding anything like a preference as between creditors, and at the same time with the idea of protecting whatever is a bona fide transaction. The first part of the clause is an adaptation of section 44 of the English Bankruptcy Act. It goes a little further than the language of the English Bankruptcy Act, and so do many of the Statutes of the provinces of Canada. We have declared in section 31, as drawn, that where a transaction is entered into with a view to giving a creditor preference over other creditors it shall be null and void, or where a transaction is one which has the effect of giving such creditor a preference over the others it shall be void as against the trustee. These last words are not in the English section but have been for many years in the Ontario Act, and, I think, in the Acts of a great many of the provinces of Canada.

An attempt was made in subsection 3 of section 3! to extend the law considerably because in that the drafter of the Bill undertook to define what should be deemed to have the effect of giving a creditor a preference. That is going a step beyond any legislation on the subject of bankruptcy as far as I know. A great many protests were received in regard to subsection 3. Many of the ablest lawyers have communicated .with me on the subject and various commercial bodies have also sent their representations. Upon the whole, I am inclined to think it would be wiser simply to eliminate subsection 3 altogether and in its place to substitute a clause which will be section 33 when we come to that section.

There may be men who are obliged to go on the bench because they are not able to make a living at the bar and in addition have gone behind. These men might be forced into bankruptcy and no judge could possibly continue to occupy his position under such circumstances. The remark that the Solicitor General made to the effect that these people should not be above the law has no force, for the reason that you make them amenable to the law if they wish to take advantage of it by voluntarily applying to be put in bankruptcy. There will be nothing in this section, if amended, to prevent any person from taking advantage of the Act and voluntarily going into bankruptcy. The objection I take is that men who are not traders are going to be forced into bankruptcy in the same way as the ordinary trader.

Mr. JOHN A. STEWART: The question of affixing the stamp was very fully canvassed when the Act was passed. The retail drug trade, as well as the manufacturers, were heard and the present practice was the result. One argument advanced at the time in favour of that practice wras that the stamp was intended as a w'ar tax, and to be paid not by the manufacturer or by the druggist, but by the purchaser or consumer.

STEWART:,,SUPPLY BILL.,PROPRIETARY OR PATENT MEDICINE ACT AMENDMENT.,,"Yes. I am giving you the argument advanced at the time. If the stamp were affixed by the manufacturer the cost would be added to the invoice price and would be paid for by the druggist when he paid for the goods. Therefore the druggist would have a capital investment of the value of the stamps affixed to all articles on his shelves which were liable under the Act; and, this being a war tax, when it was repealed, as it logically would be at the conclusion of the war, the druggist would still have everything on his shelves stamped which under the Act had been subject to this stamp duty, while the purchaser of new goods subsequently purchased would be relieved of the amount of the tax. That was the consideration that carried weight, and I have reason to believe that many of the retail druggists are not averse to the present practice. There is no possible question, though, that the tax might very well come off altogether, because it is stated that 62i per cent of the revenue has 'gone in expenses of collection and inforcement. There is undoubtedly a very strong agitation on the part of retail druggists to have the tax done away with altogether. But I have reason to believe there is some difference of opinion in regard to any change in the manner of collection if it is to continue, for the reasons I have stated.

If, under the section as it stands, every prescription brought into a drug store has to be dispensed by a duly licensed druggist, I can quite see the need for this amendment, because it would be impossible to conduct a drug business on any such arrangement.
Mr. PETER MoGIiBBON: I do not think my hon. friend (Mr. Sheard) has grasped the point at all. As I understand it, we are allowing anybody without any training at all to manufacture these medicines, and to use some of the most dangerous drugs in the pharmacopoeia.

The purpose is that the preparation shall be continuously supervised only when required by the minister. In many cases it was deemed by the trade too expensive to require this supervision, and the officers of the department thought that a clause along the lines of this proposed amendment would ensure sufficient protection to the public.
Mr. PETER MoGIBBOiN: Surely such companies are not manufacturing medicine for the public without having trained men in charge, and if they have trained men in charge, it does not seem to be necessary to amend the clause.

Very seldom does he do any wholesale business. If he has to pay $2 for the registration of the formula of each of these remedies it is a fairly heavy tax, and at the maximum would mean $30. The wholesale druggist may be manufacturing two or three lines, but selling thousands of dollars worth, and only paying a tax of $4, $6, or $8, while the retail druggist is paying two or three times that amount on his small sales. It may be an argument that the Act cannot be enforced against retail druggists. But if it is enforced over every part of the country as strictly as any other Act is enforced, I think it will work a great injustice against retail druggists who manufacture their own lines of patent medicines.
Mr. ANODER'SON:	If a druggist puts
these prescriptions on his counter, and a person comes in complaining of bronchitis, and the druggist says, "" I have a remedy,"" and hands him a bottle from the counter, he is practising medicine contrary to the Act. I think if this Bill is passed he will be precluded from that practice, because it says that no medicine shall be given out as a proprietary medicine for any specific disease.

My only object in suggesting a change of the amendment is that the interests of the retail druggists shall not be unjustly affected. If the Bill is passed in its present form the retail druggist who manufactures his own line of patent medicines and sells them in very small quantities, is going to pay a very large proportion of the revenue derived from this business. I think that revenue should be collected from the large manufacturers of patent medicines. It may be interesting to the Committee to know that patent medicines to the amount of $20,035,954 were manufactured last year in Canada, which, when resold to the consumer, would probably bring in a return of $30,000,000 or $40,000,000. This great quantity of patent medicines was produced by the large manufacturers, and I think they ought to pay a higher fee for each article they produce than $1. On the other hand, the retail druggist should not be taxed over one dollar for each article which he puts up and sells as a patent medicine. I would suggest that the retail druggist be exempted from this fee and that he simply have to pay his registration fee of two dollars. I have shown that the tax is not equitable as between the retail druggists and the large manufacturer.

A very large quantity of patent medicines are used by the poorer classes. Whether they are good or harmful in their effect, the fact remains that a great many people believe they derive benefit therefrom and therefore have recourse to .these medicines to a very large extent. As has been said by the preceding speaker, if a higher license fee were imposed it would result in increasing the price of patent medicines, with the result that the masses will experience more difficulty in purchasing them and will labour under a sense of injustice.

STEWART:,,SUPPLY BILL.,PROPRIETARY OR PATENT MEDICINE ACT AMENDMENT.,,"To resume, Mr. Chairman. A very wrong impression is apt to be created in the mind of the public by the resolution which associates derivatives of coal tar with opium. There are many of the derivatives of coal tar in very general use not only under prescriptions from practising physicians but on sale to the public. As to their effect on young children, tha-t is a matter on which members of the medical profession in the House are more competent to judge than myself. But in associating the derivatives of coal tar with opium, I think an entirely wrong impression is likely to be created as to the injurious effects of these coal tar derivatives. This is particularly objectionable at present. There is no branch of research that is likely to produce more useful preparations than the future development of the coal tar industry. I suggest that if in

the opinion of the medical men certain of the coal tar derivatives could be used without injury, they should be permitted for children up to the age specified in the amendment, provided that the preparation was approved of by the Advisory Board as being 'harmless to infants over a certain age.

, member for Beauce. I think we should put on the statute-book a distinct and positive limitation to the general sale of opiates and narcotics of that class, especially when they are sold in such a way as to be procurable by nurses and those having the care of infant children.
The ordinary soothing syrups that are sold so commonly in the drug stores owe their value largely to the opiate and morphine which they contain. These are readily purchasable, and they can be readily procured by unscrupulous or careless nurses for the sole purpose of securing quietness on the part of an infant, irrespective of the harm they do. The apprehensions which have been expressed by various members of the House are weU grounded, and I think strong legislation should be provided so as to prevent the general sale of these articles. Nearly the whole of the so-called soothing remedies for children owe their pernicious influence to the opiate derivative in the form of codeine and morphia which they contain. I think there is something in the exception taken by the hon. member (Mr. Steele) to linking up, particularly the preparations of coal tar with opium preparations. If you can link up coal tar derivatives, carbolic acid and other preparations, which are very largely family medicaments, or which are used for various disinfecting purposes, it is a question how far we should go in that particular inclusion. I think that might be reconsidered and we might specify more accurately what particular preparations of coal tar should be included. The family of coal tar products is a very large one. I am not sure that it would not include many of the analine dyes and preparations that are not medicinal at all. Certainly it would include many of the ordinary domestic disinfectants', which are used as disinfectants pure and simple, sometimes by the gallon. I do not suppose it is the intention of the Act to prohibit their employment in that connection, and yet they might be construed to be included in coal tar products or derivatives under this Act.

The purpose of this section is to get a revenue to assist in meeting the expense of the administration of the Act. In connection with most Acts of this character, where there has to be an official inspection and oversight of the manufacture and distribution of the article, it has become the practice to make a charge. In the United States and some European countries the license fee is determined upon the principle we are adopting in this section. It seems to be satisfactory to the trade; at least, I am instructed that the officers of the department have conferred with the manufacturers and that they do not disapprove.

represent the city, I cannot allow some of the remarks which have been made to pass without objection. In the first place, I Would point out to the Minister of Public Works (Mr. Carvell) that he is in error when he casts some doubt upon the quantity of work done by the men employed in his department. I have some personal knowledge of the work these men do, and venture to say that the working men and mechanics in the departments in Ottawa work as hard and as faithfully as those who work for private corporations.
In regard to the agreement which is now being entered into between the city of Ottawa and the Government of Canada I submit that (the amount which the Government propose to offer is entirely inadequate. What is the situation? One-fifth of the whole taxable property of the city is owned or held by the Government.
i

When a Government leases a building the revenue which the city would otherwise derive from that building and the land upon which it stands immediately stops. The result is that the Government, unless it is placed in the position of the ordinary citizen, escapes the payment of a large share of the taxation. I fail to understand upon what principle the Government should not be treated as all the other citizens of Ottawa are treated. If the Government had to pay the city of Ottawa, the amount of payment would be in the neighbourhood of $600,000 instead of $100,000 that they propose to give to the city under this new agreement. I am not speaking for the moment of the $150,000 which the Government. propose to give to the Improvement Commission, because the city of Ottawa [DOT] has no control over that commission or the expenditure of that money. The Commission is one appointed by the Government, it is responsible to the Government and it spends this money upon the parks and driveway which surround the city of Ottawa, presumably for the benefit of the people of Canada and incidentally for the benefit of the people of Ottawa. But, in carrying out the scheme of the late lamented Sir Wilfrid Laurier to make Ottawa "" the Washington of the north,"" it was suggested that this Commission should be formed independently of the corporation so as to beautify and make attractive the city for those who have to come here to do business. The city of Ottawa is to receive only $100,000 for the services it renders* What services does it render? It supplies water to the Government and, although the supply is not under meter, the best information that the corporation officials can obtain is that the Government uses water, if it were metered, to the value of nearly $100,000. There is no restraint upon the use of it in any way; they use what they want.
Mr. MoMAiSTEE: We do not even have hot water to wash our hands with.

Then the city gives fire protection. That is an important item. The Government uses the sewers of the city; and there are other services supplied which if supplied to a private individual or a resident would cost that individual from $50,000 to $100,000. Why should the rest of the people pay for the services rendered to the Government of Canada? I hope the Minister of Public Works and the Committee who are still dealing with this question will further consider a more
159i
reasonable settlement in connection with the items I have mentioned.
It is true that there has to be set off against the extreme amount, say, $600,000 or $800,000 a year, the advantages that the city derives from the fact that it is the Capital. There is no doubt that there are numbers of people who come here on Government business who would not come to Ottawa if it were not the Capital, and that a certain amount is spent and business is increased by that fact. But I think if the matter were gone into carefully and fairly with the view of placing the arrangement with the city of Ottawa upon a business basis, we ought to receive at least $300,000, allowing for all those other incidental advantages which are brought to the city by reason of the fact that it is the Capital of Canada.
I still hope and trust that, notwithstanding what the minister has said, he has not yet made up his mind not to meet the city, and its position as stated by the mayor, more fairly, from the point of view of the city, at all events, and make an amicable arrangement upon the basis of the value of the services rendered.
I would ask the Committee to remember that one-third of the people of Ottawa including their families, are Government employees and that the city loses a large sum of money that it would not lose if these people were engaged in some other industry. If we could have an industry in Ottawa employing 15,000 men and women we would gain,, it is quite evident, not the amount that the Government has proposed to pay, but a much larger sum in return for the services rendered in connection with water, fire protection, sewerage, and hospitals. We supply the hospitals for the city of Ottawa and these are used by the civil servants. The Government indirectly gains a benefit in that respect. We could tax their incomes, but the cost of collectr ing the income tax from the Civil Service would probably eat into a large portion of the revenue derived from that source. The arrangement heretofore has been that the city should not collect the income tax from the civil servants, it being, in a sense, paid by the Government under this arrangement.
I can only commend to the Minister of Public Works the spirit of the late lamented Sir Wilfrid Laurier and express the hope that he will follow in his footsteps in his desire to make Ottawa, what it should be, as the Capital City of Canada, and to make it really the city of the whole people. If

my hon. friend will adopt the spirit of the late lamented gentleman of whom I have just spoken, I am sure that a better, a fairer arrangement can be made with the city of Ottawa than that which, apparently, the minister proposes, namely, the payment simply of $100,000 into the treasury of the corporation.

These three subsections are somewhat intricate and drawn in legal and technical language. The object of them is to avoid certain settlements commonly known as voluntary or fraudulent settlements as against creditors, and at the same time due care has, I think, been taken to protect all genuine, bona fide settlements entered into for good consideration and for laudable purposes. Section 29, subsection 1, applies to what I might call settlements which have been made and completed prior to bankruptcy. There are three classes of settlements to which it was not applied. First, it does not"" apply to a settlement made before and in consideration of marriage; second, it does not apply to a settlement made in favour of a purchaser or incumbrancer in good faith and for valuable consideration; third, it does not apply to a settlement made on or for the wife or children of the settlor of property which has accrued to the settlor after marriage in right of his wife.
With these three exceptions it applies to all other voluntary settlements, and if they are made within one year of the date of the bankruptcy such settlements are to be void against the trustee. If the bankruptcy happens within five years of the date of settlement they will be void against the trustee unless the parties claiming under the settlement can prove the following: First, that the settler was, at the time he made the settlement, able to pay all his debts without resort to the property which comprised the settlement; and, secondly, that the interest of the settler in the property passed out of his hands at the time of settlement. Subsection 2 seeks to avoid as

preferences certain marriage convenants or contracts which are not uncommonly made in this country, but which are more prevalent in- -Great Britain, that is; covenants or promises made in consideration of marriage that at some future time the husband or the wife, as the case may be, will settle on the other party property of some kind, either in money, securities or in land. Subsection 2 provides that any covenant or contract to settle at a future time made by a person in consideration of his or her marriage, either for the future payment of money for the benefit of the settlor's wife or husband or children, or foT the future settlement on or for the settlor's wife or husband or children, of property wherein the settlor had not at the date of the marriage any estate or_ interest whether vested or contingent, shall be void as against the trustee, except within certain very stringent limitations. Subsection 3 applies to any payment of money or any transfer of property which may hereafter be made -by the settlor pursuant to any promise or -covenant made before marriage. These sections apply only to settlements hereafter made. We do not seek by this clause * to interfere with settlements which have been made, or covenants or promises which have been entered into prior to the coming into operation of this Act, But for the future, covenants or contracts entered into for the settlement of property in consideration of marriage will, speaking, generally, be void in the case of bankruptcy as against the trustee for the creditors. That is the object sought to be attained by section 29 and the three subsections. It is merely carrying into effect, and perhaps extending a little, a principle which has been known to English law from at least the days of Elizabeth, because it is under the statute of XIII Elizabeth that we first find any law in regard to voluntary or fraudulent preference or conveyances. Away back in the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was enacted that any conveyance which has the effect of hindering, defeating, delaying, or defrauding a creditor is void unless it be made for good cause and be bona fide. We have carried that law up to the present time in Canada and in all the provinces of Canada. This section 29 is merely declaratory of the extent of that law, and expressly states in what limitations certain settlements and covenants will be upheld in the future as against a trustee in bankruptcy. I move as an amendment to subsection 3 of section 29 that in line 47, after the word "" insurance,"" the following wmrds be inserted:-

In -favour of the husband, wife, child or children of the settlor.
The effect of this will be that no policy of life insurance in- favour of the husband, wife, child, or children will be attacked as preference. That, I think, is in accordance with modem law on the subject, where these various parties are recognized in matters of insurance as privilege persons.

iMr. GUTHRIE: It has been pointed out since this section was adopted that there is no provision in it with regard to what estate a trustee can convey. Of course, it is assumed that he can convey all the estate of the debtor. It has been suggested that a declaration to that effect be incorporated in the Bill. It has also been drawn to my attention that there is a difficulty in the province of Quebec in regard to trustees' deeds; they do not operate in that province quite in the same way as they do in other provinces. It
4 p.m. seems that liens, mortgages, hypothecs and the like are not removed by trustee's deed and a clear title cannot be conveyed. Several prominent members of the Bar of the province of Quebec have directed my attention to this fact and have suggested an amendment so that we might give to a trustee's deed in that province the same effect as is now given to a sheriff's deed. Personally I see no objection to inserting a clause to that effect, if it is the desire of the Committee. I move that the following be added as subsection (3):
All sales of real estate made by the trustee shall vest in the purchaser all the legal and equitable estate of the debtor therein.
That will be the general clause. Then I move that the following be added as subclause (a) of subsection (2):
(a) In the province of Quebec a sale of real estate made by the trustee shall have the same effect as to mortgages, hypothecs or privileges then existing thereon as if the same had been made by a sheriff in the said province under a writ of execution issued in the ordinary course, and the title conveyed by such sale in the said province shall have equal validity with a title created by sheriff's sale and the conveyance of the trustee shall have the same effect as a sheriff's deed in the said province.

Has he had any correspondence with the consumers and farmers who have to purchase this fertilizer or with any farmer's association?

(Mr. A. K. MACLEAN: I cannot say that there has been any consultation with the consumer. I would like to impress upon my hon. friend that the tax is merely upon the brand. It is not $8, $16, or $24 per ton. The manufacturer may sell 100,000 tons of a certain brand but he will only be charged $24. It will not afford any substantial proportion of the. cost to the department of the administration of the Act. I do not think it is a burdensome tax or that it will meet with any opposition from the consumer.
Mr. MeCOIG: This seems to be a very simple matter to take up the time of the House with. As other matters come before the House, as commissions and officers are appointed, the department itself provides for defraying the expense, but when, it comes to such an important question as fertilizer is to the producers of this country and also to the consumers, it does seem ridiculous that a little cent or two cent tax has to be collected to defray the expenses of the officer who administers the Act. I do not see why the department does not assume the responsibility itself and pay the expenses of the administration of the Act instead of having some officer pulling a cent or two cent tax or a hundred pounds out of the purchaser, of the fertilizer and administering the Act at his expense. In the department there are men who are being paid by the Government to look after matters of this kind without penalizing the consumer by collecting a cent on every hundred pounds or twenty cents on every ton. They will have to keep a lot of bookkeepers to keep track of the administration of this Act and the distribution of the stamps. It is going to involve a lot of unnecessary expense.

I have given a good deal of thought to it, having regard to the discussion which took place on the question of absconding debtors. It will be remembered that at the last meeting of the Committee considerable discussion took place as to what provision we should insert. I_find that the dictionary meaning of the term "" abscond "" is:
To remove one's self from the jurisdiction of the court; to place one's self in hiding.
In my judgment, and it has been confirmed by the conferences I have had with some very prominent lawyers both from

Ontario and Quebec, I think the section would be improved if we inserted the words "" from Canada "" after the word "" abscond "". The section would then read: "" Abscond from Canada."" It must be remembered that the Act has Dominion wide application. The mere fact that a debtor goes from one province to another would hardly in my judgment constitute absconding; he is still within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, and he is not in hiding.
Therefore I move:
To amend! section 55 by adding the words ""from Canada"" after the word ""abscond"" in the twelfth line of the said section at p. 44 of the Bill.
It will then read:
If, after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition against him, it appears to the court that there is probable reason for believing that he has absconded, or Us about to abscond from Canada, with a view of avoiding payment of the debt in respect of which the bankruptcy petition was filed, or of avoiding appearance to any such petition or of avoiding examination in respect of his affairs or of otherwise avoiding, delaying or embarrassing proceedings in bankruptcy against him.

We have not at the present time a uniform law in all the provinces in regard to this matter. In the province of Ontario in case of assignment we allow the landlord one year of past due rent as a preference, and also three months future rent. I understand that in the province of Quebec the landlord can legally claim one year's future rent, and I think varying sums are permitted in the other provinces. The Committee which had this Bill in charge last year paid a great deal of attention to this section. It was urged that if we interfered with landlords' rights landlords would insist on stiffer terms when leases were negotiated, and that the rent probably would become payable in advance. However, a body representing almost thirty thousand retail merchants of this country, who ara the great tenant class among the merchants, appeared before the Committee and specifically approved the enactment. So far as they are concerned they are not afraid of the terms which may be imposed upon them by landlords in the future. This section provides that when bankruptcy proceedings take place the landlord's right

to a preference over other creditors shall be for rent for the last three months of the term, and it will be a first charge upon the estate. A landlord can always protect himself; he does not need to let his rent get three months in arrear. He has special privileges which other creditors do not possess; he can distrain the goods of his tenant and can realize at almost any moment. He is negligent if he allows his rent to become more than three months in arrear; and for the protection of the general creditors the Committee thought that three months was a fair and reasonable amount of rent to allow as a preference over the claims of other creditors. It was with that view that this section was drawn as it now appears. Of course, he is not deprived from claiming for all the rent due, but for anything beyond the three months he can only claim as an ordinary creditor. The Committee thought that was pretty fair treatment for the landlord, and it would be a good thing to make it uniform throughout Canada.
We must bear in mind that landlords have always been creatures whom our legislation and British legislation have favoured from time immemorial. Our present law of landlord and tenant is a relic of the feudal system and was made when landlords sat in Parliament, but tenants did not. Up to fifty or sixty years ago the law was so onesided in favour of the landlord that it was practically a disgrace. Gradually the hardships have been ameliorated by legislation; but to-day in Ontario a landlord is permitted too large a claim, in my humble judgment, when he is allowed one year of arrears and three months advance rent in the case'of assignment. I do not know what view the Committee will take of the clause, but in my judgment it is a very fair one.

For instance take the case of a married woman who has inherited property from her parents, which is entirely separate from the estate of her husband, and has advanced money to him to carry on his business.
I fail to see the wisdom or the fairness of the change. I think the wife is just as legally entitled as any outsider to rank as a creditor of that estate. Her money and her property are her own in that case, and she makes the loan as a purely business transaction so far as she and her husband are concerned. It seems to me, not looking at it from the legal aspect, but from the ordinary business aspect, that the woman should have the protection of the court for her estate as against her husband, and that he on his side should have similar protection against his wife.

So that husbands and wives will know after this Bill becomes law that if they loan money one to the other for business or other purposes they are taking chances under this section, and their claims may be postponed to those of otljier creditors. The reason for the section is that in the majority of cases of assignment a husband or a wife prefers a large claim against the estate. It may be that the claim is perfectly valid in most cases, but there are many cases in which the claim: is decidedly invalid and should not be allowed to prevail as against the creditors. Such fictitious claims are so easily made and so hard to defeat that you must in some way protect ordinary creditors against them. To do so we must enact something such as we have attempted by section 48. That section has been largely used in England, and it will be used in this country, too, in future, I am sure. Case after case comes up when not only does the husband or the wife prefer a claim as a creditor for money loaned, but in addition a claim for wages. Those claims may be proper enough, but in future, if this Bill becomes law husbands and wives must take notice that such claims will only be paid after the claims of other creditors. If with that notice staring them in the face they allow their claims for wages to accumulate they will have to take the consequences. It is in order to defeat the large number of fictitious claims which are presented in cases of bankruptcy, that it has been found necessary, I think, in every civilized country which has a bankruptcy law to include a clause of this kind. If it had a retroactive effect I would not support it as I do; but it only applies to the future.

I object to the application of Part I of the Bill to non-traders. This is the first time that there has been brought into the House of Commons of Canada a Bankruptcy Act which includes non-traders in its application. The Bankruptcy Act of 1875, which was repealed in 1879, and the Bill introduced in 1897 by Mr. Fortin, who is now judge of the Superior Court, did not apply to non-traders. I have gone carefully over legislation on bankruptcy of different countries, and I believe the only countries in which Bankruptcy Acts apply to nontraders are Great Britain and the United States. In Prance, Belgium and other countries, the Acts do not apply to nontraders. My principal objection to the extension of the law to non-traders is this: The enforcement of a bankruptcy law is a serious matter; it means a searching investigation into the affairs of a man by his creditors. It is encroaching on private rights. It allows the creditors to find out private secrets of all kinds and, in fact, it is a grave violation of property rights. The debtor ceases to have charge of his business and his creditors take his place and as Thallier says in his study on bankruptcy, only the most important reasons can justify such an action. The necessi-
[Mr. Jacobs.)
ties of trade afford Parliament an opportunity of adopting such measures, although this is clearly odious to private rights. Credit requires such legislation, such violation of the liberty of the proprietor, and business cannot dispense with it. In what position would a trader be if he could not obtain credit from his banker or other creditors? That is the reason for a bankruptcy law. The law should give the banker or other creditors the assurance that if the debtor should fail, a trustee will be named who will take charge of his assets for the benefit of all creditors, present or absent. Otherwise, without this law there would be no protection for the creditors in contingencies against which no one can be safeguarded. In business relations many creditors now reside far away from their debtors, while other debtors are more easily accessible. If the insolvency law were abolished, creditors living near the debtor and being consequently more in touch with him than those who are distant, would seize his assets first, to the prejudice of those living far away; and without insolvency legislation there would be this further effect, that only cash sales would be made. There would be no more credit, and in consequence practically no trade. This consideration, however, does not, I submit,
. apply to non-traders. The judge, the doctor, the lawyer, or the professional man lives on his income or his salary, and has no justification in living beyond his means. His profession should preclude the necessity of speculations inherent to trade, and if he obtains credit it is not on the guarantee of any assets but merely on his personal promise to pay, and his creditors will wait until he receives his income. Unlike the case of the trader, to whom credit is a business necessity, society is not interested whether the man who receives a salary gets credit or not. Admitting that the non-trader contracts debts, it is highly improbable that his creditors will either be so numerous or most of them so far distant that some living in proximity to the debtor will reap all the benefits to the prejudice of the others. Besides that, there is a constitutional viewpoint to consider. I will grant for a moment that the law of bankruptcy in regard to the trader, even if it touches civil rights and property, as it necessarily does, is within the province of the federal power. But I contend that subsection 21 of section 91 of The British North America Act evidently conferred such power, because it pertained to the trade and commerce legislation, which is exclusively within the purview of the Federal

Government. I am sure, however, that the intention of the legislators in reference to subsection 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act, which gives the province control of legislation in regard to property and civil rights, was not to extend the bankruptcy legislation to anything outside trade and commerce, and it would undoubtedly go beyond their intention if this law -were made applicable to nontraders. I therefore move, seconded by Mr. Jacobs:
That subsection 1 of clause 8 be amended by striking out all the words after the first line of said section, beiing line 21 of nage 8, and substituting the following words: "" non traders.""

point upon which there might be considerable argument. There is no doubt that in the Insolvency Bill of 1375 an attempt was made to confine the operation of that Act to traders, and one of the objections to the Act always was that it was so confined. It is contended that there is a large class of non-traders who are 'debtors and should be treated as ordinary citizens of the country, amenable to the ordinary laws, whether of bankruptcy or otherwise. Another difficulty is to give anything like an adequate definition of the word ""trader."" The definition in the Act of 1875 was certainly defective, but it covers almost two pages of typewritten matter, defining almost all classes of business enterprise we know in Canada. But still it would not suffice for a definition at the present time, because we have a great many avenues of trade and commerce today that were not in existence then. So that it would be extremely difficult to define just who were and who were not traders. In England the experience has been that the Act should apply generally to all classes. I think that about fifty years ago, in the sixties, the Act was limited to traders, but after an experience of some years, that Act was extended, and the British and the United States Acts to-day both apply to all classes of the people in regard not only to obligations created by the Act, but to the benefits which are conferred upon the honest debtor in the way of obtaining his discharge. I know, however, that in France, Belgium, and one or two other continental countries the bankruptcy Acts are still confined to traders. Having heard from as many public commercial bodies as I could upon the subject, and having heard a long discussion in the Special Committee by a great many interested classes, I concluded, and the Committee concluded, that this Bill, in order to have a fair chance of
operation, should be made general in its application. For instance, it was urged by the very large association of retail merchants which has a membership in Canada of some 30,000, that it was unfair to them to put all the imposition on their shoulders and allow them none of the benefits. As it was pointed out that one of the great debtor classes was professional people, the question was asked, why should they not be included? and the Committee took that view. My o-wn view is that if you are to give the Act a fair chance of success you must extend it beyond the trading classes. If it should prove to be burdensome or to be an undue imposition upon the people, within a year of its operation there would be a demand for its repeal. But I do not think it will be burdensome. On the contrary, I think it will be a great benefit to both the debtor and the creditor classes, and I certainly support the present generality of its terms.

It is said that the farmer is very much more subject to unforeseen accidents than any other class of people in the community. He may be solvent to-day, with bright prospects for the coming year, and when everything looks promising he may experience a disastrous accident. He could be put into bankruptcy by reason of his inability during a season to meet maturing liabilities, and he might be sold out and his farm taken from him. But in the ordinary course, if he were given another year or two, he would have big crops and be on his feet again and be re-established. He might be the victim of natural causes beyond his control, and for that reason the Act was not made to apply either to the farmer or to the small wage-earner.

The advisory hoard shall have power to prescribe what shall be deemed a sufficient medication of medicines containing alcohol in excess of two and a half per cent to make them unfit for use as beverages.
There is a considerable agitation in all the provinces in connection with the sale of patent medicines and the fact that they are too high in alcoholic content. Any patent medicines containing over two and one half per cent of alcohol must be approved by the Advisory Council before they can be sold. I wish to amend this section by inserting after the word ""registration"" on the second line the following:
Or any medicine containing more than two and a half per cent of alcohol or containing any of the drugs mentioned in or added to the schedule of the Act.
We are not amending the schedule, which contains a list of dangerous drugs which can be used only with the consent or permission of the Advisory Council. Two and a half per cent is fixed by reason of the fact that in no province is that alcoholic content in drugs or patent medicines prohibited.
I wish to amend the subsection further by striking out the words ""essential formula and composition of such medicine"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words ""quantity of alcohol or of such drug or drugs contained in such medicine."" This will put the Advisory Board in a position to determine whether the alcoholic content is in excess of two and a half per cent, and will also give information as to the drug or drugs contained in such medicine. The section as it now stands requires the disclosure of the essential formula and com-



position of the medicine. It was deemed possible that that would be unfair, because it would compel the proprietor to disclose all knowledge relating to his property.

Mr. JOHN A. STEWART: The remarks of the hon. gentleman (Mr. Steele) are very likely to create a misapprehension in the minds of the members of the Committee. When he states, as he has done, the volume of the goods manufactured the inference might be drawn that that volume of business comes under the provisions of the license which has to be taken out under the Bill. But under the provision of the Proprietary and Patent Medicines Act the manufacturer of a patent or proprietary medicine has two courses open to him. He may put upon the label of his goods the formula of the contents. If he does not do that he must register it as a proprietary or patent medicine. The only preparations which will be subject to this license, as I understand it, are those which are registered. Now a very small proportion of the business referred to by the hon. member (Mr. Steele) represents a registered business. In addition to those patent or proprietary medicines which do not contain the formula upon the label and which come under the license, there is a /very large volume of preparations which are manufactured for dispensing-preparations which are manufactured for the druggist and dispensed upon the prescription of physicians. All that business does not come under the necessity for a license, as I understand the Bill. It would therefore be a very great mistake to imagine that anything more than a small proportion of the
[Mr. A. K. Maclean!

most important clauses of this Bill. With regard to the new section 6, it will strike every member of the Committee that if a drug is "" dangerous for infants under one year old "" it is dangerous also for children a year and a half old. The most important question in connection with the manufacture and sale of patent medicines is that which relates to the use of soothing or calmative syrups for children. The use of these preparations in 'Canada has assumed such formidable proportions that we cannot ignore the subject. What they contain is well known to the medical profession, to pharmacists generally and to the better-educated class of the population. They contain opium and the derivatives of opium)-

that is, morphine, codeine, heroine, the-baine and other narcotics. If the good Canadian mothers were cognizant of the ravages caused among their dear ones by the use of these preparations, they would immediately and entirely abstain from administering them to their children. They are induced 'to use them by the alluring descriptions on the labels. It may be argued that you should not interfere with a well-established trade in Canada. But what is the importance, I ask, of the advantages reaped by manufacturers of these patent medicines as compared with the necessity of preserving 'the health of those beings who to-morrow will constitute the very -essence of the Canadian population? It may be known to some-it is not to me- that heartless mothers, knowing what they do, administer calmative syrups for the purpose of soothing their children.
But it is well known to every one that, for instance, in the absence of the mother, an unscrupulous servant may administer those syrups in large quantities, and the mental and physical consequences cannot be measured. Therefore, I intend to move an amendment to section G, reserving for myself the right to express my opinion further on clause 7. I am not going to adhere to the wording of this amendment; if it be found that an amendment suggested toy some member of the committee or by the minister may be more effective, easier of administration or of carrying out, I am ready to accept such suggestion. I move to amend clause 1 of the present Bill by striking out the proposed section 6 and replacing it by the following:
6. The manufacture, importation or Bale ot all proprietary or patent medicines containing opium or its derivatives or any derivatives of coal tar intended for administration to children under fifteen years, are prohibited.

I am quite sure, after having discussed this matter with some of the medical authorities, that many of the subjects fit for our asylums or even for our jails, were the early victims of these soothing syrups, because all their troubles in life can be traced to the use of opium and narcotics generally. The other day, a very distinguished doctor from Montreal told me that he could point out on the street young men of twenty or twenty-five years of age whose demeanour showed the use of narcotics when they were infants. It is admitted to-day that it is a great misfortune that we should allow any of this poison to be served by fathers or mothers to their children. Many associations of

ladies, doctors, members of all sects and denominations, have taken a special interest in what is called baby welfare. The other day I received from the Baby Welfare Committee of Montreal a letter which has doubtless been sent to the minister, This letter informs me that the following resolution was adopted unanimously at a meeting held at Montreal a few days ago:
Whereas, there is a Bill to amend the Proprietary or Patent medicine Act now before the House of Commons, sponsored by Hon. A. K. Maclean, which, in the experience of the medical adviser and ohild welfare specialists connected with the various units of the Baby Welfare Committee of Montreal, does not safeguard the moral or physical entity of the young child, inasmuch as under section 6, of the proposed Act, opium-containing medication is readily procurable for any infant or child: and, inasmuch, as the Act applies solely to opium in section 6, without reference to its more dangerous habit forming derivatives, as morphine, heroin, etc., being fully considered.
Therefore, be it resolved that this committee go strongly on record as disapproving of section 6 and 7, as at present constituted, and that we urge the manufacture and sale of opium, or its derivatives, in medication be absolutely forbidden in Canada, as not being conducive to the moral or physical betterment of our younger citizenship. In default of this recommendation being adopted, that a conspicuous skull and crossbones emblem, with the word ""Poison"" distinctly printed across the container, be employed as a deterring influence upon the promiscuous distribution of this unnecessary class of narcotic medication, destined for popular sale and consumption among infants and children in Canada.
I would not only put this sinister emblem of a skull and cross-bones on the bottle containing this poisonous substance for the children, but bar the substance completely from the homes of Canada. It is a crime to allow those soothing syrups, made up of opium or other narcotics, to be exposed for sale in our drug stores or be sold by quack doctors travelling throughout the country. We have already too many subjects in our asylums, too many juvenile delinquents in our jails who have acquired their bad habits by the use early in life of those so-called medicaments. I hope the Committee will accept the wise amendment and that we shall not hear any more of those soothing syrups which are nothing less than poison.

I am sorry only that it does not go further. What is not good for a child of fourteen years of age is not good for a child of sixteen years of age. Had this amendment not been moved, or should it be rejected by the Committee, I would suggest another amendment, that a sub-clause be inserted in
clause 7 to the effect that no proprietary or patent medicine should be manufactured, imported, exposed or offered for sale in Canada if it contains opium or any of its derivatives. I would exclude all patent medicines containing opium from sale or importation, whether administered to children under fifteen years of age or to adults over fifteen years of age. They should certainly he prohibited for children. The facts presented to the Committee by the hon. members for Beauce (Mr. Beland) and Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) to-ndght clearly indicate the views of the people who are engaged in baby welfare work, the people who, perhaps, above all others, are qualified to speak of the results of the administration of medicines containing opium to our little children. No doubt opium serves a good purpose sometimes, but too often, in fact in the great majority of cases, it is used to sooth a child suffering from some ailment which should be corrected if the child is going to enjoy good health. It covers up the real ailment affecting the child, keeps the child quiet, and if this goes on long enough, the child will no doubt be found in a moribund condition from the disease from which it is suffering, assisted possibly by the doses of opium. There is another effect which it has on the child, and which, I think, is admitted by all who have given the matter study, namely, that upon the brain. The brain of a child undergoes its greatest development in the first six months of life.
The brain of an adult weighs on an average from 1,400 to 1,500 grammes, and that of a baby six months old on an average about 1,000 grammes. Yet, during these six months of infant life, there are thousands of babies being fed daily on these remedies, call them what you choose, whose chief ingredients are opium or its derivatives, and the development of the brain of a child so fed is interfered with to the extent to which opium is administered to it. The chances of children fed that way for growing up healthy both physically and intellectually are greatly reduced. We not only think that opium should not be sold indiscriminately for administration to children, but that, in Ontario at least, it should not he sold indiscriminately for the use of even adults, who experience considerable difficulty in purchasing opium in any drug store in Ontario. The purchaser of opium has to sign the poison book and observe all the precautions with which the law surrounds its sale. Every person realizes that it is not in the interest of even adults that * they should be permitted to buy opium

freely and use it as they please. That being so, why should they be allowed to purchase it indiscriminately and with the greatest freedom in the form of patent medicines? I think we should exclude it entirely in patent medicines, and when people want opium they should procure it under proper supervision, duly observing the precautions and restrictions which the law imposes. It will be observed that the first sub-clause prohibits the importation and sale of any medicine containing cocaine or any of its salts or preparation. Now, we all know that cocaine so used is not likely to be nearly so injurious as opium, and if we_ prohibit cocaine the arguments in favour of the prohibition of opium are very much strengthened. For these reasons I certainly would vote for the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Beauce. If, however, it is not considered satisfactory to the Committee, I would move the amendment which I have suggested, that the entire importation, manufacture and sale of any patent medicines containing opium or its derivatives be prohibited. I believe that now is the time for us to take this step. The very fact that liquor is being restricted in its sale is an argument for us at this early date to protect the people against the indiscriminate use of opium and more injurious drugs which too often will be substituted for the liquor that is prohibited.

raised by the hon. member for Temiscouata is that the present Bill which was introduced and passed in the Senate before being submitted to the House of Commons contains clauses involving public taxation in the form of license fees and therefore could not originate in the Senate and must be rejected by the House of Commons'. It is true that section 53 of the British North America Act expressly provides:
Bills for appropriating any part of the public revenue, or for imposing any tax or impost [DOT] shall originate in the House of Commons.

But there are many precedents where Bills of this nature have been passed in the Senate and the money clauses embodied in -the Bills have been later submitted to a Committee of the Whole House. Bourinot at page 493 says:
It is frequently found convenient to introduce bills involving public expenditure in the Senate, and in such a case the money clauses are embodied in the bill as presented, in order
to make it more intelligible	These clauses
are always considered in a previous Committee by the Commons, and regularly referred to the Committee of the Whole on the bill.
The same practice applies to Bills imposing any tax or impost and should be followed in all cases when the House of Commons insists upon its rights and privileges. These rights and privileges are laid down in rule 78, but rule 87 provides that in order to expedite the business of Parliament, the House will not always insist on -the privilege of laying aside a Bill sent from the Senate because it imposes a tax, an impost or a penalty. The House of Commons undoubtedly had the right and privilege of laying aside -this Bill until it had been preceded by a resolution which would have been considered by a Committee of the Whole House, but the proper -time for -the exercise of this privilege was when the order was called for the second reading of this Bill. It was read a second time without objection and is now under -consideration in Committee. A committee has no power to refuse the consideration of a Bill which has been submitted to it by the -House, and I must therefore declare that the point of order is not now well taken.

It does not appear to me that in this age one legitimate excuse can be offered for putting up in a patent medicine any form of opium to be dispensed by the laity to children. The proposal seems to be absolutely contrary to the rapidly growing practice in the medical profession which is to eliminate it as far as possible, in treating diseases not only of infants but of adults. We in the medical profession know that from time to time an emergency call comes from some home where an infant has, through ignorance or other cause, taken an overdose of opium, laudanum, paregoric, or some form of the derivatives of opium; and many of us have seen lives pass out of this world owing to the fact that medicines of that nature were easily procurable and were more or less daily used in the home as household remedies. Now the object of this Bill is to protect the public; it could have none other. It does look to me, I must say, as though the interests had not been very far away when this Bill was drawn-not only as regards the present hut with respect to other' succeeding clauses. This measure has all the earmarks of a Bill which'had, I was going to say, been commercialized, or the earmarks of a commercial transaction. We must not get away from the fact that our object is to pass a Bill that will protect the public. I do not think any professional man or any layman can adduce a single argument to-day that will justify putting any derivative of opium into the hands of the public to be administered to children without knowing its nature, because that is what this Bill means. If you are going to give the public any form of medicine containing any of the derivatives of opium for goodness sake let it be indicated on the bottle so that the purchaser can read it and know they are administering some form of a drug which is very dangerous and very injurious. Opium, of course, has its uses, but I think I am within the mark when I say that practically the only great use it has is to alleviate pain; all other uses are detrimental to health and are absolutely dangerous to children.

If you prohibit the manufacture and sale of them at once you may be striking at what was at one time a perfectly lawful business, and I should like to think over what the likely effect of the prohibition would be.

Since this House has assembled I have been asked a number of times to make changes in the rooms in this building. Such changes are not very great and I give them only as an illustration. It takes men and material to make those changes, and, so far as I know, they have all been granted. With the great congestion of civil servants in the last three or four years-and it has oeen great-a staff gets so big that it cannot occupy its premises and other premises must be provided for it ana it has to be moved. There always must be changes. This is like a man moving into a new house-no man ever moved into a house in his life but his wife wanted some papering done or something else; she wanted a change of some kind. That is the way witu civil servants-they want change and one has to have a staff to provide for such changes, and we have a staff of 157 men. I must, say I think those men are pretty busy most of the time. Sometimes I wonder if it would not be possible to get a better system than we have in regard to the changing of staffs; but with the congestion that we have had to contend with in the last year and a half we have done the best we could, and I do not see the possibility of any improvement until the Dominion of Canada owns its own buildings. I do not believe one-half of our staff is housed in our own buildings to-day, and even when the new Hunter building is completed, as I hope it -will be in July or August next, still nearly one-half of the staff will be housed in rented buildings. And every time we make a change in the occupation of those buildings or any portion of them it costs money to move the staffs, and something must always be done, such as the buying of new furniture. Civil servants are just like other human beings; they want things and they usually get them. I can give no other explanation. I have no doubt at all -that in this Committee there are a dozen men who could take those 157 men, if they could deal with them as hired men, and put competent foremen

over them, and who would get more work out of them than the country is getting. But I cannot stand .over them myself. In the last year and a half those men have been hired and they have been fired, if necessary, entirely by the superintendent in charge of them. No man, excepting the clerk of works, has anything to say as to who shall go on that staff; he has an absolutely free hand. I have talked the matter over with him many times; I have found fault that those men are not giving as much service as^ they should give; but he assures me they are, and unless I can find time to go out and supervise them personally, I do not see how I am going to change conditions. I want to treat the Committee fairly and tell them exactly t'he situation. I think a change should be made; I think our staff is too big, but now these men want an eight-hour day. They want nearly everything except work.

That contract expires on the 1st of June. There have been a number of conferences between the city of Ottawa and a committee of the Government as to the terms of the renewal of the contract. The Mayor of Ottawa published a very exhaustive statement in January last setting forth his contention as to what the Government should pay, the amount he fixes being about $800,000 a year. We had a meeting before Parliament met and a great many since, and finally, representing the Committee, I made an offer of $150,000 a year to the Ottawa Improvement Commission for the next ten years-$100,000 a year to go to the city to cover all services performed by the city for the Government, and the Government to relinquish to the city the right of taxing civil servants upon their incomes. For a great many years there has been an arrangement by which the city of Ottawa has not taxed the incomes of civil servants by reason of amounts which the Government has been paying to the city. I have taken the ground that it is none of our business. The civil servant resident in the city is an ordinary citizen and should pay his taxes the same as any other man. In my proposal we relinquish in favour of the city the right of taxing civil servants. The city think they can raise $57,000 a year from income taxes, but my opinion is they should get $75,000 or $80,000 a year under a proper administration of the law. Taking the city's figure it would mean that instead of $150,000 going to the 'Commission there would be a sum of $307,000. The city claim that we should pay on the basis of taxation.

There would be an actual increase of $135,000 a year paid by the Government. Under the British North America Act, Government property is not taxable, and the city of Ottawa claim that because of this fact we should pay them an amount representing what the taxes ordinarily ought to be. Of course, we cannot admit that, but there is one matter with which I have a great deal of sympathy. One of the most antediluvian laws regarding water or any public utility that I have ever heard of in my life exists in Ottawa. A man pays $2, I think, on the first $1,000 valuation of his property, and after that pays a greater rate on every other $1,000. And you pay that no matter whether you use water or not, or whether you have half a dozen bathrooms or none at all; and even if it is a vacant lot you pay the same water rate. They say that a fair valuation of Government property in Ottawa would be about $20,000,000, and that therefore we should pay water rates according to this valuation. I say that we should pay water rates according to the number of thousand gallons used, and I have offered to the city of Ottawa to put a meter on every service in the city and pay a fair meter rate, and that if we were not able to agree on a fair rate we could leave the matter to arbitration. We are also using their sewers to a certain extent, and pay a certain amount for that. They say we should pay one-fifth of the total maintenance charges of the sewers, but we have not agreed to that. My opinion is that all public utilities, whether used by the Government or by private individuals, should be metered; in other words, that a man should pay for what he consumes, no more and no less. But the city says: No, we should pay for all our services on the basis of their method of taxation and upon their valuation of our pro'perty. I think we shall agree in the end. I am of opinion that there is a lot of ordinary politics in it, and no doubt in the next fortnight the city will accept the offer we have made them, which I think is a generous one.

The members might occupy the apartments for the period of the session, or probably for the year, if they cared to, and could pay rent to the Government.

manner in which the hon. member for Ottawa (Mr. Fripp) has discussed the matter. I realize that it is a matter somewhat personal to him and one which is of interest to his constituents. I think I have approached it in the fair spirit of the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and that I have even gone very much farther because I realize that the city has grown larger and that the world has advanced in ten years. Whereas Sir Wilfrid Laurier made an arrangement for the payment of $100,000 to the commission, I have offered $150,000 a year, and whereas he made an arrangement for $15,000 to go to the city, I have offered $100,000 and the right to tax the Civil Service which will represent about $50,000 or $75,000. It seems to me that, if you are going to make comparisons, I certainly have not been less generous than was the gentleman who has been referred to.
I do not want to discuss it any further than is necessary but I want to state to my hon. friend that the remarks which I made about the work done by employees were made from personal experience and knowledge, and not from hearsay. Of course, I have not had an opportunity of watching these men in a great proportion of their work, but I have had an opportunity of seeing With my own eyes certain things in the year and a half that I have been connected with the department, and I want to tell him that I would not feed some of these men for what they are doing. I would not have them on my premises at all. Why, the Speaker of the House told me only yesterday that he had a lot of these men repairing a room for him-one little room that a man would paint in one-half or three-quarters of a day. Yet six or seven men spent four or five days on the work. Wherever you go it is the same thing.

If the same installation were in a building owned by myself in Renfrew, the inspector of the Hydro-Electric would condemn it instantly and my insurance rates would be considerably increased. I understand that the Government carries its own insurance, or rather it does not carry insurance on its property. But the Government is responsible not only to itself and its employees but to the city in which its buildings are situated, and if a fire occurred through the negligence of the Government or its employees as regards defective wiring, if the ruling of inspectors is to be a guide in this matter, the Government would be responsible. If the Government are responsible, ll should like to know who would be the one that would be considered guilty in this connection under an enactment passed here a few weeks ago, to amend thp Criminal Code respecting the prevention * of fires. One section of the Bill says:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who, by negligence, causes any fire which occasions loss of life or loss of property.

I have been in customs houses in small cities where the building was large enough for a city five times its size.

But as there are some new departments being established, such as the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, the Land Settlement Board and the Income Tax office, the idea is to have a general rearrangement of the offices of the different departments when the Hunter building is finished. We have rented the whole of what is called the Rea or Daly building of which we get possession on the 1st of July. So that in July or by the 1st of August we hope to be able to make a re-arrangement by which we shall have each department in one place. I am sorry to say that two important departments will still be distributed in sections in different places around the city, but we are making very short term leases and hope within the next year and a half, at the outside, to get rid of a great many buildings now under lease and to reduce to quite an extent the amount of rental paid in Ottawa.

minister considered the unit system in the organization of Government offices to conserve space, and do away with so many partitions and doors in the buildings? It seems to me, in going through the departments as they exist at the present time, that one of the great difficulties is that the buildings were never designed as office buildings. Looking at the Hunter building from the outside it does seem to me to be the first approach to a successful modern office building that has ever been designed in connection with the Government service in any part of Canada. If it is carried out on that system it will not only conserve space but it will ultimately result in reducing the cost of the entire office staff.

I agree that this is the first attempt that has been made in Ottawa to have a real office building. The building is constructed on the unit basis. There are nine floors all practically alike. The only difference is that there is a well in the centre 100 x 50 feet. The building is 200 x 150 feet. That gives a row of offices all around the position of the well 50 feet wide. There is an 8-foot passageway which leads between two 20-foot offices, one on the outside and one on the inside. The great long corridors have been divided up according to the necessities of the departments intending to use them. Some of the space may be divided up into rooms 10 x 12 and in other cases there will be rooms from 30 to 50 feet long. We have consulted several departments which are going to use the different floors and have divided and partitioned the space according to the arrangements of these departments.
As to the future, I think I suggested on .a former occasion that it would well repay any member of the House of Commons to take a forenoon, go to Mr. Ewart's office and see the models which he is preparing for the new building which we all hope in the not-too-far-distant future to see erected on the expropriated area on Wellington street. That idea is being carried out there exclusively. We propose to adopt the unit system in .so far as the unit system can be applied to that building. The first unit will contain the Supreme Court room, and after that there will be a series of office buildings practically all built upon the

same general plan to carry out the idea that my hon. friend suggests.

I suppose that there is no clause in any Bankruptcy Bill or any assignment and preferences -act which causes as much trouble to the bar, the public and the courts as the question raised in section 31 of the present Bill. It is drawn with the purpose of avoiding anything like a preference as between creditors, and at the same time with the idea of protecting whatever is a bona fide transaction. The first part of the clause is an adaptation of section 44 of the English Bankruptcy Act. It goes a little further than the language of the English Bankruptcy Act, and so do many of the Statutes of the provinces of Canada. We have declared in section 31, as drawn, that where a transaction is entered into with a view to giving a creditor preference over other creditors it shall be null and void, or where a transaction is one which has the effect of giving such creditor a preference over the others it shall be void as against the trustee. These last words are not in the English section but have been for many years in the Ontario Act, and, I think, in the Acts of a great many of the provinces of Canada.

An attempt was made in subsection 3 of section 3! to extend the law considerably because in that the drafter of the Bill undertook to define what should be deemed to have the effect of giving a creditor a preference. That is going a step beyond any legislation on the subject of bankruptcy as far as I know. A great many protests were received in regard to subsection 3. Many of the ablest lawyers have communicated .with me on the subject and various commercial bodies have also sent their representations. Upon the whole, I am inclined to think it would be wiser simply to eliminate subsection 3 altogether and in its place to substitute a clause which will be section 33 when we come to that section.

The fact that a man is in public life is a sort of presumption that he is not in a position to pay his debts. Take the case of judges on the bench. There may be men who are obliged to go on the bench because they are not able to make a living at the bar and in addition have gone behind. These men might be forced into bankruptcy and no judge could possibly continue to occupy his position under such circumstances. The remark that the Solicitor General made to the effect that these people should not be above the law has no force, for the reason that you make them amenable to the law if they wish to take advantage of it by voluntarily applying to be put in bankruptcy. There will be nothing in this section, if amended, to prevent any person from taking advantage of the Act and voluntarily going into bankruptcy. The objection I take is that men who are not traders are going to be forced into bankruptcy in the same way as the ordinary trader. In the case of the trading class it is incidental to the business that they must owe money. In a case of the non-trading class it is accidental that they should owe . money.

STEWART:,,SUPPLY BILL.,PROPRIETARY OR PATENT MEDICINE ACT AMENDMENT.,,"Yes. I am giving you the argument advanced at the time. If the stamp were affixed by the manufacturer the cost would be added to the invoice price and would be paid for by the druggist when he paid for the goods. Therefore the druggist would have a capital investment of the value of the stamps affixed to all articles on his shelves which were liable under the Act; and, this being a war tax, when it was repealed, as it logically would be at the conclusion of the war, the druggist would still have everything on his shelves stamped which under the Act had been subject to this stamp duty, while the purchaser of new goods subsequently purchased would be relieved of the amount of the tax. That was the consideration that carried weight, and I have reason to believe that many of the retail druggists are not averse to the present practice. There is no possible question, though, that the tax might very well come off altogether, because it is stated that 62i per cent of the revenue has 'gone in expenses of collection and inforcement. There is undoubtedly a very strong agitation on the part of retail druggists to have the tax done away with altogether. But I have reason to believe there is some difference of opinion in regard to any change in the manner of collection if it is to continue, for the reasons I have stated.

The purpose is that the preparation shall be continuously supervised only when required by the minister. In many cases it was deemed by the trade too expensive to require this supervision, and the officers of the department thought that a clause along the lines of this proposed amendment would ensure sufficient protection to the public.
Mr. PETER MoGIBBOiN: Surely such companies are not manufacturing medicine for the public without having trained men in charge, and if they have trained men in charge, it does not seem to be necessary to amend the clause.

Very seldom does he do any wholesale business. If he has to pay $2 for the registration of the formula of each of these remedies it is a fairly heavy tax, and at the maximum would mean $30. The wholesale druggist may be manufacturing two or three lines, but selling thousands of dollars worth, and only paying a tax of $4, $6, or $8, while the retail druggist is paying two or three times that amount on his small sales. It may be an argument that the Act cannot be enforced against retail druggists. But if it is enforced over every part of the country as strictly as any other Act is enforced, I think it will work a great injustice against retail druggists who manufacture their own lines of patent medicines.
Mr. ANODER'SON:	If a druggist puts
these prescriptions on his counter, and a person comes in complaining of bronchitis, and the druggist says, "" I have a remedy,"" and hands him a bottle from the counter, he is practising medicine contrary to the Act. I think if this Bill is passed he will be precluded from that practice, because it says that no medicine shall be given out as a proprietary medicine for any specific disease.

My only object in suggesting a change of the amendment is that the interests of the retail druggists shall not be unjustly affected. If the Bill is passed in its present form the retail druggist who manufactures his own line of patent medicines and sells them in very small quantities, is going to pay a very large proportion of the revenue derived from this business. I think that revenue should be collected from the large manufacturers of patent medicines. It may be interesting to the Committee to know that patent medicines to the amount of $20,035,954 were manufactured last year in Canada, which, when resold to the consumer, would probably bring in a return of $30,000,000 or $40,000,000. This great quantity of patent medicines was produced by the large manufacturers, and I think they ought to pay a higher fee for each article they produce than $1. On the other hand, the retail druggist should not be taxed over one dollar for each article which he puts up and sells as a patent medicine. I would suggest that the retail druggist be exempted from this fee and that he simply have to pay his registration fee of two dollars. I have shown that the tax is not equitable as between the retail druggists and the large manufacturer.

STEWART:,,SUPPLY BILL.,PROPRIETARY OR PATENT MEDICINE ACT AMENDMENT.,,"To resume, Mr. Chairman. A very wrong impression is apt to be created in the mind of the public by the resolution which associates derivatives of coal tar with opium. There are many of the derivatives of coal tar in very general use not only under prescriptions from practising physicians but on sale to the public. As to their effect on young children, tha-t is a matter on which members of the medical profession in the House are more competent to judge than myself. But in associating the derivatives of coal tar with opium, I think an entirely wrong impression is likely to be created as to the injurious effects of these coal tar derivatives. This is particularly objectionable at present. There is no branch of research that is likely to produce more useful preparations than the future development of the coal tar industry. I suggest that if in

the opinion of the medical men certain of the coal tar derivatives could be used without injury, they should be permitted for children up to the age specified in the amendment, provided that the preparation was approved of by the Advisory Board as being 'harmless to infants over a certain age.

, member for Beauce. I think we should put on the statute-book a distinct and positive limitation to the general sale of opiates and narcotics of that class, especially when they are sold in such a way as to be procurable by nurses and those having the care of infant children.
The ordinary soothing syrups that are sold so commonly in the drug stores owe their value largely to the opiate and morphine which they contain. These are readily purchasable, and they can be readily procured by unscrupulous or careless nurses for the sole purpose of securing quietness on the part of an infant, irrespective of the harm they do. The apprehensions which have been expressed by various members of the House are weU grounded, and I think strong legislation should be provided so as to prevent the general sale of these articles. Nearly the whole of the so-called soothing remedies for children owe their pernicious influence to the opiate derivative in the form of codeine and morphia which they contain. I think there is something in the exception taken by the hon. member (Mr. Steele) to linking up, particularly the preparations of coal tar with opium preparations. If you can link up coal tar derivatives, carbolic acid and other preparations, which are very largely family medicaments, or which are used for various disinfecting purposes, it is a question how far we should go in that particular inclusion. I think that might be reconsidered and we might specify more accurately what particular preparations of coal tar should be included. The family of coal tar products is a very large one. I am not sure that it would not include many of the analine dyes and preparations that are not medicinal at all. Certainly it would include many of the ordinary domestic disinfectants', which are used as disinfectants pure and simple, sometimes by the gallon. I do not suppose it is the intention of the Act to prohibit their employment in that connection, and yet they might be construed to be included in coal tar products or derivatives under this Act.

In 17 pounds of ammonia 14 pounds would be of the other ingredient. The technical officer of the department has never been in favour of expressing this particular ingredient in the terms of ammonia; and he has always been willing and anxious to use the term nitrogen. In many countries the term nitrogen is used instead of ammonia, and since our discussion on this Bill the other night he has expressed a preference for an amendment.

represent the city, I cannot allow some of the remarks which have been made to pass without objection. In the first place, I Would point out to the Minister of Public Works (Mr. Carvell) that he is in error when he casts some doubt upon the quantity of work done by the men employed in his department. I have some personal knowledge of the work these men do, and venture to say that the working men and mechanics in the departments in Ottawa work as hard and as faithfully as those who work for private corporations.
In regard to the agreement which is now being entered into between the city of Ottawa and the Government of Canada I submit that (the amount which the Government propose to offer is entirely inadequate. What is the situation? One-fifth of the whole taxable property of the city is owned or held by the Government.
i

When a Government leases a building the revenue which the city would otherwise derive from that building and the land upon which it stands immediately stops. The result is that the Government, unless it is placed in the position of the ordinary citizen, escapes the payment of a large share of the taxation. I fail to understand upon what principle the Government should not be treated as all the other citizens of Ottawa are treated. If the Government had to pay the city of Ottawa, the amount of payment would be in the neighbourhood of $600,000 instead of $100,000 that they propose to give to the city under this new agreement. I am not speaking for the moment of the $150,000 which the Government. propose to give to the Improvement Commission, because the city of Ottawa [DOT] has no control over that commission or the expenditure of that money. The Commission is one appointed by the Government, it is responsible to the Government and it spends this money upon the parks and driveway which surround the city of Ottawa, presumably for the benefit of the people of Canada and incidentally for the benefit of the people of Ottawa. But, in carrying out the scheme of the late lamented Sir Wilfrid Laurier to make Ottawa "" the Washington of the north,"" it was suggested that this Commission should be formed independently of the corporation so as to beautify and make attractive the city for those who have to come here to do business. The city of Ottawa is to receive only $100,000 for the services it renders* What services does it render? It supplies water to the Government and, although the supply is not under meter, the best information that the corporation officials can obtain is that the Government uses water, if it were metered, to the value of nearly $100,000. There is no restraint upon the use of it in any way; they use what they want.
Mr. MoMAiSTEE: We do not even have hot water to wash our hands with.

Then the city gives fire protection. That is an important item. The Government uses the sewers of the city; and there are other services supplied which if supplied to a private individual or a resident would cost that individual from $50,000 to $100,000. Why should the rest of the people pay for the services rendered to the Government of Canada? I hope the Minister of Public Works and the Committee who are still dealing with this question will further consider a more
159i
reasonable settlement in connection with the items I have mentioned.
It is true that there has to be set off against the extreme amount, say, $600,000 or $800,000 a year, the advantages that the city derives from the fact that it is the Capital. There is no doubt that there are numbers of people who come here on Government business who would not come to Ottawa if it were not the Capital, and that a certain amount is spent and business is increased by that fact. But I think if the matter were gone into carefully and fairly with the view of placing the arrangement with the city of Ottawa upon a business basis, we ought to receive at least $300,000, allowing for all those other incidental advantages which are brought to the city by reason of the fact that it is the Capital of Canada.
I still hope and trust that, notwithstanding what the minister has said, he has not yet made up his mind not to meet the city, and its position as stated by the mayor, more fairly, from the point of view of the city, at all events, and make an amicable arrangement upon the basis of the value of the services rendered.
I would ask the Committee to remember that one-third of the people of Ottawa including their families, are Government employees and that the city loses a large sum of money that it would not lose if these people were engaged in some other industry. If we could have an industry in Ottawa employing 15,000 men and women we would gain,, it is quite evident, not the amount that the Government has proposed to pay, but a much larger sum in return for the services rendered in connection with water, fire protection, sewerage, and hospitals. We supply the hospitals for the city of Ottawa and these are used by the civil servants. The Government indirectly gains a benefit in that respect. We could tax their incomes, but the cost of collectr ing the income tax from the Civil Service would probably eat into a large portion of the revenue derived from that source. The arrangement heretofore has been that the city should not collect the income tax from the civil servants, it being, in a sense, paid by the Government under this arrangement.
I can only commend to the Minister of Public Works the spirit of the late lamented Sir Wilfrid Laurier and express the hope that he will follow in his footsteps in his desire to make Ottawa, what it should be, as the Capital City of Canada, and to make it really the city of the whole people. If

my hon. friend will adopt the spirit of the late lamented gentleman of whom I have just spoken, I am sure that a better, a fairer arrangement can be made with the city of Ottawa than that which, apparently, the minister proposes, namely, the payment simply of $100,000 into the treasury of the corporation.

These three subsections are somewhat intricate and drawn in legal and technical language. The object of them is to avoid certain settlements commonly known as voluntary or fraudulent settlements as against creditors, and at the same time due care has, I think, been taken to protect all genuine, bona fide settlements entered into for good consideration and for laudable purposes. Section 29, subsection 1, applies to what I might call settlements which have been made and completed prior to bankruptcy. There are three classes of settlements to which it was not applied. First, it does not"" apply to a settlement made before and in consideration of marriage; second, it does not apply to a settlement made in favour of a purchaser or incumbrancer in good faith and for valuable consideration; third, it does not apply to a settlement made on or for the wife or children of the settlor of property which has accrued to the settlor after marriage in right of his wife.
With these three exceptions it applies to all other voluntary settlements, and if they are made within one year of the date of the bankruptcy such settlements are to be void against the trustee. If the bankruptcy happens within five years of the date of settlement they will be void against the trustee unless the parties claiming under the settlement can prove the following: First, that the settler was, at the time he made the settlement, able to pay all his debts without resort to the property which comprised the settlement; and, secondly, that the interest of the settler in the property passed out of his hands at the time of settlement. Subsection 2 seeks to avoid as

preferences certain marriage convenants or contracts which are not uncommonly made in this country, but which are more prevalent in- -Great Britain, that is; covenants or promises made in consideration of marriage that at some future time the husband or the wife, as the case may be, will settle on the other party property of some kind, either in money, securities or in land. Subsection 2 provides that any covenant or contract to settle at a future time made by a person in consideration of his or her marriage, either for the future payment of money for the benefit of the settlor's wife or husband or children, or foT the future settlement on or for the settlor's wife or husband or children, of property wherein the settlor had not at the date of the marriage any estate or_ interest whether vested or contingent, shall be void as against the trustee, except within certain very stringent limitations. Subsection 3 applies to any payment of money or any transfer of property which may hereafter be made -by the settlor pursuant to any promise or -covenant made before marriage. These sections apply only to settlements hereafter made. We do not seek by this clause * to interfere with settlements which have been made, or covenants or promises which have been entered into prior to the coming into operation of this Act, But for the future, covenants or contracts entered into for the settlement of property in consideration of marriage will, speaking, generally, be void in the case of bankruptcy as against the trustee for the creditors. That is the object sought to be attained by section 29 and the three subsections. It is merely carrying into effect, and perhaps extending a little, a principle which has been known to English law from at least the days of Elizabeth, because it is under the statute of XIII Elizabeth that we first find any law in regard to voluntary or fraudulent preference or conveyances. Away back in the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was enacted that any conveyance which has the effect of hindering, defeating, delaying, or defrauding a creditor is void unless it be made for good cause and be bona fide. We have carried that law up to the present time in Canada and in all the provinces of Canada. This section 29 is merely declaratory of the extent of that law, and expressly states in what limitations certain settlements and covenants will be upheld in the future as against a trustee in bankruptcy. I move as an amendment to subsection 3 of section 29 that in line 47, after the word "" insurance,"" the following wmrds be inserted:-

In -favour of the husband, wife, child or children of the settlor.
The effect of this will be that no policy of life insurance in- favour of the husband, wife, child, or children will be attacked as preference. That, I think, is in accordance with modem law on the subject, where these various parties are recognized in matters of insurance as privilege persons.

this Act is that water-powers are essentially and increasingly a public utility. All water-power developments of business organizations developing and transmitting water-power are more and more public utilities. Consequently, the power of expropriation, under the very principle which my hon. friend has enunciated, is necessarily vested with the Government. We do nothing more here than is done under the Government. We do nothing more here than is done under the Irrigation Act. Under that Act the very same authority to expropriate under similar circumstances is vested, and the same with the Railway Act. It would never do to require every company that is developing a water-power to come back to Parliament when it wanted to expropriate a few acres that might be needed in connection with the development of its water-power. Water-power development is necessarily, in a sense, local-not like a railway which runs over a considerable length of line-and in connection with its development only a very small acreage may have to be expropriated.
They may expropriate if the minister is convinced that it is a proper case for expropriation; that is to say, if upon the advice of his water-power authorities it is shown to him that the land is required in connection with that public utility, then the clauses that Parliament has passed will be invoked, but only then. Surely that is a sufficient safeguard. I would be quite willing to have "" Governor in Council "" substituted for minister, and it would be along the same line as the preceding

clause which authorizes the Governor in Council to expropriate lands in a proper case where the development is a public undertaking. In this case it is a private undertaking under lease from the Crown, and we say that it being a public utility, if it is shown that certain land must be acquired to make that utility useful and effective, then the power to expropriate is granted.

We assume their validity by this clause (m) of section 10 and propose to act upon it.

They can exercise the authority which originally is ours if it is convenient that they should-and in my judgment it would very probably be convenient.

I have the pamphlet published by the Government showing the principles upon which the Act is to be administered, and on page 11 I find under the heading of ""General Principles and Standards Recommended for Consideration in Schemes,"" Section (4), which reads:
(4) Limit ot Income of persons to be provided with dwellings.-In order to ensure that the money shall be loaned to those who most need *it, no person in receipt of an income exceeding- $3,000 per annum should be eligible as a purchaser or tenant of a house erected with the aid of Government funds in any schemes carried out by provincial governments, municipalities, housing associations or owners of lots.
I take it that if a man has $50,000 in vested at 6 per cent, bringing him in exactly $3,000 a year, he can take advantage of the scheme; but if he has $3,001 of income he can not. My mind has been all along directed to the idea that this scheme was to help the man who had no money of his own; but if it is to help the man with a capital of $50,000 capable of investment at 6 per cent, I am going to oppose it. I would like the minister to tell me if he intends to apply the scheme to a man who has $50,000, which at 6 per cent would bring him in an income of $3,000.

MR. ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"After the Order in Council was passed. All we require is that the amount shall not exceed the amount stated; those who take advantage of the loan may accept less if they see fit. I say, Ontario fixed their maximum at a lower figure than this, but since then they have revised their figures and have now fixed as their maximum the figures mentioned in this Order in Council:
(3)	Ownership of land.-Public money may be advanced for building houses on sites owned by :-
(a)	The Provincial Government or municipality.
(b)	Housing Societies or Companies comprising groups of citizens associated to promote good housing, supplied with proper improvements ; such Societies or Companies to have not more than a statutory limitation of dividends payable on stock of 6 per cent.
(c)	Owners of lots for the purpose of erecting houses for their own occupancy.
The reasons for limiting the use of the Government money to loans on properties of the classes mentioned were the following. In the first place, if the province itself or the municipality was prepared to undertake a housing scheme, to provide dwellings at cost for workingmen and returned soldiers, we were glad to advance money for that purpose. If they did not agree to go into it for themselves, or if they went into it only partially, and public-spirited citizens who desired to improve housing conditions and who were prepared to limit their dividends to six per cent would form housing companies in order to promote good housing, the moneys might be loaned to such housing companies. But it was not the intention to lend the money to men interested in real estate speculation or to builders for speculative pur-

poses. Then the tennis of the loan follow :
(4)	Terms of years for repayment of loans. -The Federal loan will be repayable by the Province over a period of twenty yeais. Provided that in order to encourage the erection of more durable buildings, and to bring the financial terms within reach of a large number of workers, the period of 20 years may be extended to 30 years in respect of any portion of the loan which the Provincial Government may decide to re-lend for thirty years for such purposes as purchasing land or erecting buildings under the above class. Repayments by the Provinces on account of Federal Loans may be made quarterly if so desired, or otherwise a.s may be agreed upon.
These are the four conditions which the Federal Government imposes in connection with loans to any of the provinces. But we have recommended to the provinces that they themselves should impose certain standards in their housing schemes, and the provinces which have taken advantage of the loan have largely followed these standards.

minion Government lends the money to the provinces, putting the responsibility on the provinces. The Provincial Government of Saskatchewan, as I understand the matter, wishes to pass the financial responsibility on to the municipalities or the cities, and the cities at the present time, owing to rapid development in the past, have pretty well taken up their borrowing powers and do not think they should assume this additional burden, as they look on it as a national scheme.

In my part of the country I do not think there will be very much trouble about the returned soldier. Most of them came from the steel and coal works and from the farms. The soldier who left the farm, when he comes back, naturally wants to go back to the farm if he is physically fit, and it is the same with the coal miners and the steel workers. So we have not had very much trouble in Nova Scotia in that respect. If we were having trouble we would be'very glad to have provision made. Of course, it may be quite different in other places. If the minister in co-operation with the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, could formulate a concrete scheme for accelerating conditions which would help the returned soldier and his family to be properly housed he would have the hearty co-operation and sympathy and support of hon. members on this side of the House.

The Provincial Governments are not obliged to loan it at 5 per cent; they may charge 5J or 6 per cent. Then there is no stipulation that it shall be loaned to soldiers; it may be loaned to a provincial government, and that government may loan it to any person.

How does this advantage the returned soldier when you simply let loose the money to the province; or the real poor labouring man who needs the money, when you let the province make its own arrangements with a city or a company or some private individual?

For example, in Banff Park, which we own, it is indeed probable that there should be, and will be, a Dominion development to take the place of the present steam boiler that is utilized in the park.

That could be the basis for determining the bond or stock issue-if the power is for a mill, say so many thousand dollars per horse-power; if it is for distribution, increase the amount per horse-power, just as we regulate the issue of bonds by railways according to the difficulties of the ground they have to traverse, the number of bridges they have to build, and the cost of the land they have to acquire for a right of way. The man who takes out a lease is going to state to the Government what the power to be generated will be used for, and the Government is going to bind that man to do certain things within a certain time under penalty of forfeiture. The purpose for which the power is acquired is well-known; therefore it would be easy for the lessor to determine, according to his judgment and according to the potentiality of power and the service to be rendered, the amount of bonds that should be issued per horse-power.

Now, inferentially that says, as plainly as language can do so, that a person who has got an income of not more than $3,000 can get in under the scheme. If the proposition is sent forward in that shape to the provinces, they will say: ""Your own data furnished by yourselves, gave us the latitude to let Mr. John Brown, who has got $50,000 out at interest at six per cent, and earning not a cent more than $3,000 "" (providing possibly he was a returned soldier) "" come in if he complies with all the other condtions.""

MR. ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"I quite agree with my hon. friend that men of means should not be entitled to take advantage of the provisions of the Government loan. I would again draw my hon. friend's attention to the fact that this is simply a recommendation to the provincial governments, that in no case should the money be loaned to a man who earns more than this specified amount. It is within the competence of the provincial governments to limit the amount to $1,000,

$1,200, or $1,500-whatever they may determine. We are simply fixing that limit as a safeguard. I think the figure might be fixed lower; however, it was fixed at that amount. The provinces have the same object as the Dominion Government in keeping the money for the class for which the loan is provided, and may limit the amount as low as they like.
While I am on my feet may I answer the question put by the hon. member for Cha-teauguay-Huntingdon (Mr. Eobb) with reference to the form of the proposal; and also a question suggested by my hon. friend from Red Deer (Mr. Michael Clark) and my hon. friend from St. Antoine (Sir Herbert Ames)? The order is under the War Measures Act, and if any money had been advanced before Parliament met it would have been advanced under that Act, because that was the only authority the Government had for taking such action. But it so happens that no money was advanced; in other words, the provinces did not put themselves in a position before the meeting of Parliament to take advantage of the scheme. Therefore the advance will now be made by the House, if the House votes this amount, on the terms set out in the third Order in Council. The War Measures Act has no effect on it one way or the other.
Coming to the next question my hon. friend suggested, that this should be deferred until after the Budget. I do not think he was really serious. My hon. friend from Red Deer emphasized that suggestion too. I quite recognize that the question of the tariff may have a bearing upon the cost of living and the cost of materials. I am under the impression, however, that the bulk of the materials that would enter into the construction of an ordinary house are produced in Canada.

I suggested that it would be well to reduce the application of the Bill so that a man with an income of $50,000, on a six per cent basis, could not take advantage of it, and the minister said that that sum might well be reduced; therefore, 'I assume that it is still within his power to assure the House that the point will be taken up and dealt with.

If the existing power is sufficient and greater than that for which the minister is now asking, I do not see the necessity for this Bill. If the minister is asking for certain powers, and we find that they ought not to be granted to him but left with Parliament, why not take that point into consideration? I do not say that every man who wants to develop water-power should come before this Parliament and ask for the right to expropriate, but it is easy for Parliament to legislate generally with respect to cases where men wish to develop water-powers and ask for the right of expropriation, and to declare in that Act that the development is intended for public and not private purposes. The expropriatory potver should not be left subject to the whim of a man's neighbour because he has more money to pay for water-power development than the
owner of the property who has this water on his farm or domain. That is the reason I say a general law should be passed regulating this matter, and the power which this Bill seeks to confer upon the minister or the Governor in Council should not be granted. I do not say this in disparagement of the minister; but it is a matter of principle that this power ought to remain with Parliament and not be delegated to any one, except under general legislation defining the powers that can be developed and the circumstances under which the expropriation can take place.

That gives to all individuals who come within its provisions the right to develop water-power with the right to expropriate.

Resolved, That it is expedient to amend the Royal Northwest Mounted Police Act, chapter ninety-one of the Revised Statutes, 1906, and to provide,-
1.	That all members of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police Force on active service in the naval, miliitary or air forces of His Majesty during the European war, which began in August, one thousand nine hundred and fourteen, shall, for the purposes of pension for service in the said Force under the said Act, be entitled to have such active service counted as service in the said Police Force: Provided,
(a)	that the amount of any pension, gratuity or allowance which any member of the said Force receives or is entitled to receive or apply for, in respect of any injury received by him while serving in the military, naval or air forces aforesaid, shall be deducted from any pension, gratuity or allowance to which such member would be entitled under the said Act, other than a pension for years of service, irrespective of any infirmity of mind or body or bodily injury;
and,
(b)	that no widow or child of any such member who received or is entitled to receive or apply for, any pension, annuity, gratuity or allowance in consequence of the death, incapacity or injury of any such member while serving in the forces aforesaid, shall be entitled to any pension, annuity or allowance under the said Act.
2.	That in case of the re-appointment or reengagement in the Force of any person who was a member of the Force, and who, subsequent to the fourth day of August, one thousand nine hundred and fourteen, resigned or purchased or otherwise obtained his discharge from the Force for the purpose of serving in the military, naval or air forces of His Majesty during the said European war, and who served therein, the period of such service in such forces shall, for the purposes of pension only under the Royal Northwest Mounted Police Act, be deemed to have been served in the Force, and in any such case such member shall be repaid any money paid by him to purchase such discharge.
3.	That the rates of pay as fixed by chapter forty-seven of the statutes of 1913, be increased as follows:-
""Eight staff sergeants, each per diem. . $3 00 Other staff sergeants, each per diem . 2 50 Other non-oommissioned officers, per diem	
Constable, per diem	$1 75
Scouts, per diem		250
Trumpeters and buglers, under eighteen
years of age, per diem	 l 25
Working pay to artisans and others
specially employed, per diem. ...	0 75""
. That the Governor in Council may authorize extra pay to be paid to members of the Force employed as detectives, to those serving in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory, and for a period of five years from the first day of June, 1919, to any other member of the Force.
5.	That an officer who is retired compulsorily for any cause other than misconduct or inefficiency after ten years' service, shall be entitled to a pension for life, not exceeding one-fiftieth of the pay and allowances of his rank or permanent appointment at the time of hie retirement for each completed year of service.
6.	That the Governor in Council may, as to him seems fit, grant a pension to the widow and a compassionate allowance to each of the children of any officer who, having completed twenty years' service, was at the time of his death on full pay, or who, having completed ten years' service, is at the time of his death in receipt of a pension.
7.	That the pension of a widow shall be,-
(a)	if her husband was at the time of his
death on full pay, an amount equal to onehalf of the pension to which he would have been entitled if he had been retired compulsorily immediately before his death; or,
(b)	if he was on pension, an amount equal to one-half of such pension.
8.	That pensions to widows heretofore granted under the provisions of the said Royal Northwest Mounted Police Act may be readjusted in accordance with the provisions of these resolutions, but no such readjustment shall authorize the increase of any payments for pension that accrued before the passing of the Act based upon these resolutions.
9.	That every constable who is a member of the Force at the time of the passing of the Act based upon these resolutions, or who hereafter becomes a member of the Force, shall be entitled, upon retirement, to a pension for life, as follows:-
(a)	if he has completed ten but less than twenty-one years' service, one-fiftieth of his annual pay and allowances for every year of service:
(b)	if he has completed twenty-one but less than twenty-five years' service, an annual sum equal to twenty-fiftieths of his annual pay and allowances, with an addition of two-fiftieths of such pay and allowances for every completed year of service above twenty years;
(c)	if he has completed twenty-five years' service, an annual sum equal to thirty-fiftieths of his annual pay and allowances, with an addition of one-fiftieth of such pay and allowances for every completed year of service above twenty-five years; Provided, that the pension shall not exceed two-thirds of his annual pay at his retirement. But for the purpose of estimating any such pension, neither working pay nor extra pay of any man shall be considered.
10.	That the Governor in Council may authorize the Commissioner to appoint, by warrant under his hand, such officers and men, who have served in the Force, to be a Reserve, to be known as the "" Royal Northwest Mounted Police Reserve,""

REID:,Minister of Railways and Canals,LOCATION OF RAILWAYS ACT.,,,"Perhaps I may explain the purpose of this Bill. In the Railway Bill which is before the Special Committee these clauses have been changed so as to vest in the Board of Railway Commissioners the authority to approve of route maps, this authority having in the past been' exercised by the minister. When a charter was granted by the House for the incorporation * of a railway, before they could proceed with the construction of the railway a route map

had to be approved of by the minister. We now purpose to change that to provide that the Board of Bailway Commissioners shall have this ipower of [DOT]approval. It is the intention to have this Bill put through in case the regular Bailway Bill does not pass at this session. I should like to have this Bill go through the Committee now and put down for third reading, and if the Bailway Bill now before the special committee were passed I would not proceed further with this Bill. In the event of the Bailway Act not being passed at this session, we are desirous to provide that the . authority for approving of route maps shall be placed in the hands of the railway commissioners. The reason for this is that practically speaking there are only two railway systems in Canada, and it is advisable that the Board of Bailway Commissioners should decide on the route maps to be approved of. The Government railway or the Canadian Pacific railway might be involved and there might be a conflict of two interests.

I do not think it would be asked on the part of the province that the jurisdiction should be so severed. If the administration of the power itself, the mere waterfall, the mere energy that the waterfall develops, is to be under one Government and everything else under another, successful administration is impossible. The purpose of this section, and, in fact, of the whole Bill-and this is merely in harmony with the rest of the Bill-is to extend the jurisdiction of the Dominion in order to enable it adequately to administer the power itself.

improve matters to make it "" Governor in Council."" If you intend to assume the control of water-powers, to lease them and have them developed, it is a very easy matter for this Parliament to pass a law defining in what cases power of expropriation shall exist. We have a law in Quebec whereby any private individual, provided he can develop so many horse-power, can expropriate, but there is a limit, and it cannot be confined to a private individual for his own purposes. 'It would be fair and more within the rights of expropriation of eminent domain if there were a general law applicable to every man, and if the powers were graded. There are certain powers that cannot be public utilities owing to the very small amount of horse-power that can be developed, and they can be used only for limited purposes. Let us have a general law grading these powers and it would prevent the cession by Parr liament of what I think is its most sacred prerogative and duty, the protection of private rights, not leaving either in the minister or in the Governor in Council the power to give any individual the right to go over the land of his neighbour and take it from him.

I happen to have sat in the legislature of Nova Scotia for a number of years, and one of the things I continually railed against was the power of expropriation given by the Nova Scotia Government to the Dominion Coal Company. I always contended that where the public welfare was being served, the Government might well and legitimately grant powers of expropriation. But they went so far at one time down there as to grant the Dominion Coal Company the power of expropriating for the building of their own houses to accommodate their workmen. This, to the average man, would appear to be a very extreme measure, and I therefore suggest to the minister that he should be some-
[Mr. Meigh.en.1
what more cautious in the matter of expropriation. It is a dangerous undertaking that may work injustice in many cases. I am of the opinion that this section is a little bit extreme in that it gives almost absolute power of expropriation and very nearly takes away the right of private ownership of property. We cannot always ignore the rights of a private individual to his ownership of his own land. I have not considered the section with sufficient care to offer an amendment, but I think it is rather loosely drafted and perhaps the minister might reconsider it and make it more in keeping with the views that have been expressed.

The first class of cases is where development is for public utility purposes, If not, what is the general characteristic of the class? There is no other I ever heard of or that the hon. member suggests. We say here that wherever it is shown to be to the public advantage that the expropria-tory power should be exercised it can be exercised; that is all. That is really the Quebec legislation. My hon. friend from Cape Breton says it is all right if a corporation, it is all wrong if an individual. Take the Grand Bapids river in Manitoba, where there is tremendous water-power. A company has a lease of that power and purposes a large development. There is an area of land below the falls which will be flooded if further development of that power takes place, and consequently that area must be expropriated. It is private property. It is quite true that the company are not there for the good of their health or the good of the community; they are there to make money. But is the community to be advantaged by enabling the owner of a little swamp land below the falls to deny the development of the whole water-power in the Grand Rapids river?

If for waterworks or something of public advantage for a municipality, or for the development of an enterprise of any kind, well and good; but if you are going to let a man develop sixteen, eighteen or twenty horse-power for his own purpose, I

say that should not be allowed. I would make a classification of that kind to show what the minister may do under his regime. That man, I should judge, should not be entitled to go to work and for his own personal use be able to expropriate his neighbour's property. It depends on the conditions where the water-powers are located. That can be classified easily; we do it in Quebec. We go to the courts, and I think that is preferable to the Minister of the Interior or the Governor in Council, for the courts after hearing the evidence are in a much better condition to give a satisfactory decision.

If for distribution for public utility purposes, then he would allow expropriation. There might be only a hundred horse-power developed, but certainly it is in the public interest to develop it. Is 100 horse-power to lie forever unused merely because of the obstinacy of a single individual, and are we to sit by helpless? You cannot classify these matters in the way the hon. member suggests. However small the horse-power may be, it may be distinctly in the public interest to have it developed, rather than allow it to lie dormant merely owing to the obstinacy of an individual landowner. The power may be exercised harshly, but that must be left to the Governor in Council, because you cannot isolate every individual case and determine whether expropriation should be exercised there or not until you have the facts before you. So I submit to the hon. member that the Bill is most convenient and most useful and safest in its present form.

For example, the reservoir for the one may serve the other. On the Ottawa river we have no jurisdiction with regard to powers, and there is one province on one side of the river and another on the other, each with different regulations. By reason of these two conditions there is a very uneconomical power development. A lg,rge amount of capital has been invested by separate companies developing powers closely adjoining, whereas the proper and sound development would be a unified one, with one large plant producing power at much less capital cost and, consequently, at less cost to the consumer.

In the provinces, if a railway runs along a mile or ten miles of the public road, we have the power to build another post road alongside to take its place, because that is incidental to the building of the railway, but T am not so clear that the Dominion Government could exercise this power if it chose to go into the development of waterpower exclusively for its own use.

That is to say, as a part of the negotiations for the acquirement of the lease certain stipulations will be laid down. Now, the company knows it must abide by those stipulations, and if it does not want to do so it does not need to take the lease; consequently it could not complain of any hardship. It might be, though, that a company having acquired its lease. desired afterwards to change its stock issue, so as to readjust itself on a proper financial foundation, and I do not think it would be taking any chances in submitting that stock issue to the control of the Governor in Council. Without this clause that company might take its concession and get far enough away, and by exploiting the public, cause a hue and cry to be raised that the public resources were being squandered to enable friends of the Government to make a profit. We want to insure ourselves against that in advance. The mere terms upon which a stock or bond issue may be made do not involve the possibility of confiscation, or what was once called ""conscription of wealth.'' It is merely a matter of regulation-something with regard to which, if the company's intentions are honest, it is not going to be deprived of, its legitimate rights. Otherwise, of course, there should be an appeal to the Exchequer Court. But this is not a case of that nature. It does not contemplate that the Governor in Council shall have power to wipe out the company's property at all; it merely gives power to stipulate what stock and bond issues shall be made, and the like of that. So it seems to me there is scarcely any necessity for appeal to the Exchequer Court.

On the one hand we want to avoid-and the minister is trying to do that, and I absolutely approve of his action-the dissipation of the public domain in private hands by exploiters who make for themselves money which should belong to the people; but at the same time I think that any safeguard should be effected in such a way that the parties will feel they have had a square deal, and if they are dissatisfied with the decision of the Minister of the Governor in Council, an appeal to the Supreme Court will convince them that they are being fairly treated.

What is to be said after a man has had possession of such a right as I mention for sixty years if that right is to be taken away? Even if he has had possession for a shorter period, I do not think tlie arbitrary measures which the minister desired to take should be tolerated. If a man went away into the woods and built a mill which was of the greatest possible utility for the settlement and he owned that mill for a long time, he should be considered as improving land in the West. The rights of squatters have always been considered, and they have been paid for any improvements they have made.. The same right should be extended to any man who has acquired using powers of that kind for a long time, and who has meant no harm by his action. He should not be ruined by the application of this law, but should have some consideration.

I believe no provincial government in Canada, Quebec included, would do anything else but put the returned soldier in the first place in all its legislation. I do not think there is any reason why we should go into heroics over the attitude any government takes in this matter. I think the principle of this Bill is exceedingly good, and although our Government in Saskatchewan have not signified their intention of taking advantage of it, our people are quite prepared to do so. The only difficulty, as- I have already stated, is with the municipalities, and our absolute inability to take advantage of the scheme owing to our present liability. I wish our Provincial Governments had the power to pass an Order in Council removing all these difficulties, so that we might take advantage of the scheme immediately. I think this scheme is a mighty good one, for two reasons. In the first place, the returned soldier is getting the money at a very low rate of interest, lower than he could get it anywhere else. In the second place, he is getting the full amount of money he requires to build his home, and thereby become the very best type of citizen. I do not care who the man is, if he owns a home he is a better citizen than he otherwise would be. For these two reasons, I wish to see the plan made operative as far as pos-

sible. As to the difficulties in Saskatchewan, I think the Government ought to make every effort to have them removed as soon as possible, so that our returned soldiers may be able to take advantage of this plan.

I think his individuality would carry the strength and pride which would make him want his own home without asking any paternal help from the Government. It seems to me that the scheme should be limited to the class of working men earning from $1,200 to $1,500. Those men would no doubt need help. A working man earning $1,500 a ye-ar-and there are many of them-might be very thankful to take advantage of this scheme because of his family conditions, the expense to which he is put, and so forth. But to say that a man in receipt of an income of $3,000 should be eligible would probably leave the Act open to a rush of that class, who would take up the money in the various centres-and it could not be reasonably refused with this clause startling upon the Government's advertising matter-with the result that the man for whose benefit the Act would be put upon the statute-books, as I see it, would be crowded out, and with the further result that we would be forced later on to enlarge the scheme because the money already provided had been taken up by a class who did not need it and had not any right to be helped.

we will have to deal with the resolution just as it is, and that will be the greater reason for reasonableness in permitting us to have a little further opportunity for consideration and discussion.
This publication is signed by the President of the Privy Council and anything which bears his signature ought to be good reading. Moreover, if we are better informed on the subject there will not be the same need for asking questions. The hon. gentleman should let the committee go now. When the hour of half-past eleven comes it is time to go to our homes; to sit any longer is only impairing our usefulness for another day.

The first section provides that the time in which any member of the Force may have served in the overseas forces shall count for the purposes of pension. Under the Mounted Police Act as it now stands the members of the Force become entitled to a pension on retiring after twenty years' service. A large number of the members of the Force were granted leave of absence without pay to serve overseas, and others retired or purchased their discharge for this purpose. Our view is that all who withdrew from the Force in order to go overseas, if they intend to resume their place in the Force should have the time they spent overseas counted in estimating the amount of their pension. Provisos (a) and (b) are to ensure that for a disability suffered in the service overseas for which they are entitled to a pension under the general pension law applying to all who served overseas in the Canadian Expeditionary Forces, they shall not be entitled to a pension under the Mounted Police Act. This, of course, does not affect the pension for length of service.
Section 3 provides the statutory authority for the increase in pay which I intimated to the House had already been granted to the Force last year under Order in Council.

It provides that any person who is authorized by the minister shall have the power to expropriate. Now I think that is a pretty broad provision. Generally speaking, powers of expropriation are granted by the legislative
body. The power to expropriate is limited very strictly. When the minister authorizes a man to take another man's property against his will for the benefit of a private individual he is delegating a power which I think should rest alone with the legislative body. The power of expropriation is used only in case of public utilities, on the principle that the public good prevails over the individual good but under this section it is a case of the individual against the individual. Some person may acquire from the minister a water-power for the purpose of his farm, and he may want to back up the water. Under this section, upon the authority of the minister alone, he may go to his neighbour and say: ""I cannot agree with you as to price, so I am going to expropriate your land which is required for the development of my water-power, which is useful to me alone."" I think that is against the law.

That is not what I contended. What can be

done without expense to the man who is going to buy water-power is to pass general legislation applying to all Dominion water-powers which could be classified without being named specifically. We could classify them by the amount of horse-power that could be developed, and limit the extent of the powers of the individual intending to develop them. The minister is the person to decide whether or not the land is required. Plans have to be filed with him, all the records will remain with him, and the-owner-of the land will just-receive a notice under the Railway Act and then the arbitration takes place if they cannot agree upon the compensation.

Lands required for the works of any applicant, as shown by the maps and plans filed, in whomsoever they are vested, whether in the Crown or in any other applicant or licensee, or in any railway company, or in any other person whomsoever or in any interest in or right or privilege with regard to such land which is so required, may be taken and acquired by such first mentioned licensee; and to this end all the provisions of the Railway Act which and so far as they are applicable to such taking and acquisition, shall apply as if they were included in this Act.
The rest of it is the same as the wording here. That was re-enacted again in 1906 and is the law to-day. Now, this is a public utility; it must be essentially so. It may be only in a small way and it may be in a large way; but if in a small way, surely we are not going to require the expense of coming to Parliament for a special Bill. That much ought surely to be trusted to administration. That is the whole principle upon which the administration of legislation operates. The power is not granted absolutely, as the hon. member for Cape Breton seems to fear. There is no absolute provision here. The minister must be convinced-I am ready to have it made the Governor in Council-on representations of his water-power authorities that the land is required for the development of that water-power. If so, then they have to acquire it and pay for it under the provisions that are laid down. It seems to me that there can be nothing expensively cumbersome about that method.

I can see at once that if the Government, as a public ownership enterprise, is going to develop power and sell it to cities, towns, and individuals in the different provinces, a very serious situation is going to arise at once. Because if we can absolutely control this development by the Government in a province we can say that it shall be exempt from taxation. The Government can say, for example, "" Any works that we construct in the province of Nova 'Scotia shall be free from taxation; we shall not be subject to school rates or any other rates in the province "", That certainly cannot be contemplated, because when a property is built in a province it becomes ipso facto, I think, subject to the regulations of that province, so far as taxation is concerned for provincial purposes, etc. I point out to the minister that if the minister is going to develop these powers and intends to keep everything incidental to them within his own control he is bound to encounter a great deal of difficulty. If the minister is going to develop power on a large scale say, in some part of the province of Nova Scotia where the
Government might own land, he might have a considerable village there consisting of men employed by the Government, having houses and requiring everything that any other village in the province would require. Now, if that village is entirely subject to the control of the Dominion Government the Provincial Parliament could not legislate in regard to it at all, and the provincial regulations in regard to assessment and all that pertains to the running of a city, town, or municipal district, would not apply. I think it should be clearly understood the moment any condition of that kind develops that community would be subject to the laws of the province.

Their borrowing limits are fixed by the legislature of the province, and if it was considered in the interest of the province that their borrowing powers should be enlarged for this particular purpose i think the legislature would have the right to do that.
I have only one word to say in conclusion, and then I shall be glad to answer any further questions. It is a matter of gratification to the Government that the proposals they have submitted to the provincial governments have been received so sympathetically and that the Provincial Governments have evidenced a desire to co-operate most heartily with the Federal Government in working out the plan. Our proposal here is being watched with the greatest interest in 'the United States. The Rational Government in the United States did not proceed on the lines on which we are proceeding. As a war measure, they started in themselves to build a large number of houses, primarily for their own employees in connection with the various national enterprises upon which the United States had embarked. They have spent tens of millions of dollars in erecting houses themselves, and have certainly put up some very creditable houses or flats for their employees in the city of Washington and other places. It will be of interest to the House, I am sure, to know the views of one of the leading firms of architects in the United States who had charge of the housing programme of the Ordnance Department. Upon receiving a copy of our proposals the firm of Mann and MacNeille expressed their view as follows :[DOT]
We wish to express our unqualified admiration for the completeness, practicability and
simplicity of the administration methods outlined in the data received from you. We believe this to be the most practicable step toward the provision of good housing by Federal co-operation which has yet been taken in any country.
That is 'the testimony of leading architects in the United States who have been concerned with the work of the United States in providing houses for their own employees. With that information, I submit the matter to the Committee.

Certain limits must be placed upon it. My hon. friend might suggest that the Government should vote more money for this purpose; but the Government, having regard to the many demands on it, thought this was a fair amount to provide. I cannot say whether, if the Quebec Government requested that we should endeavour to meet the situation, the Dominion Government might not see its way to consider the matter, but at the present time we have had no request from the Quebec Government to deal with it in that way.
In conclusion, let me say one word in reference to the observations of the hon. member for Red Deer (Mr. M. Clark) as

to the provinces taking advantage of this scheme and how soon they will put up houses. Two or three weeks ago, I wired the premiers of all the provinces to find out how much of this sum they would need this year, with the view that if they did not require the whole of the $25,000,000 this year, I might reduce tfie estimate in view of the other very heavy charges on the country. The replies I received from all the provinces that are taking advantage of the loan indicate that they will require the full amount, and some of the provinces are, I am glad to say, adding a substantial sum themselves to the amount they are receiving for this housing scheme.

ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"I am quite in sympathy with the principle of this resolution, but it appears to contain some incongruities. In connection with the question raised by the hon. member for North Perth (Mr. Morphy),
I think the Government has gone too far in that section in putting the maximum income of those to whom this scheme may apply at $3,000. Let me take the minister's own words for it. If I understand aright the principle of a Housing Bill, it is to help those who are in congested districts and who are more or less, or who may be classed as, the poorer portion of the population. They are necessarily the poorest class of the population; otherwise they would not reside in the congested districts. Taking that as a premise, may I refer to the illustration given by the minister himself, that when he asked John Burns what measure of social reform he would most gladly recommend him to apply himself to, John Burns immediately mentioned a housing scheme. The Housing scheme in Great Britain is, I understand, applied to the class of people I have mentioned. If that be so, is it right to bring down in a resolution or a Bill a principle that those men who are earning incomes to the extent of $3,000 shall be entitled to come in under exceptionally good conditions?-to apply to the Government, to receive their loans,
10 p.m. and to get the amount that they are allowed to get under those resolutions, while those who are not nearly so well off are not allowed to do so? Does not that mean that a man who is earning $3,000 a year is in a much better position to apply for and obtain this loan, and as a consequence will get more out of it than any other man will? I think that is unquestionably so. Let us take Shacktown, for instance, which the minister mentioned. I have been there and I wonder how many of those people are in receipt of an income of $3,000 a year. If they were, they would not be living in that district and in that class of houses. This loan should be applied with a much smaller maximum income than is here set out. It is true, the minister says, that the Provincial Government has a right to make it less, but we all know that Provincial Governments-and my experience is that they are all much alike in this respect-if they have the right to take advantage of a maximum in a Bill will take it, and will say:	The Dominion Government gave us the right to go as high as

$3,000 and we shall do so. I strongly urge Upon the minister-and I am not criticising in any hostile spirit-that the maximum ought to be considerably reduced, so that it might and would apply to those who are much more in need of the assistance which this resolution will give to them than those who receive incomes amounting to $3,000. I think that would be the right thing for the Government to do, and under those circumstances they would be helping the class of people who are much more in need of help than the people to whom this resolution would, at the maximum rate, apply.

He seemed to think that I suggested that by some fiscal arrangement the milennium could be brought about. That was not in my mind by any means.

That is conduct on the part of the people of Great Britain which I am sure meets with the absolute disapproval of my hon. friend; but his disapproval does not alter the fact as to their conduct, nor does it alter the sum that has been -spent in that way, nor does it alter the other economic fact with which he is very well acquainted, that if people spend too much money on intoxicating liquors out of comparatively limited incomes they will very likely get into slums under whatsoever fiscal arrangement they may live.
['Mr. Pardee.]	i
I wanted to clear myself from the misapprehension which appears to have arisen in the mind of my hon. friend. I have no panacea for society, I have no panacea for poverty; none of us have. It might easily be argued on very high authority that there is no panacea for poverty because we were told by a very high authority two thousand years ago that the poor we have always with us, and a straining of the interpretation of that statement might lead us to think that we always will have them with us. While we do have the poor with us, their poverty is produced by many causes, and none is more potent in Great Britain than that which I have mentioned, which is totally unconnected with any fiscal arrangement. I was anxious to make a contribution, if possible, from the back benches to the wisdom and effort of the Cabinet, and I am sure my hon. friend will allow me to clear myself from possible -misapprehension on this point.

If that were the object, so far as the West and the cities of the western provinces are concerned, we have no slums. There is only one alternative to consider, and that is the one which was put forward this evening by the minister, namely, that most of the money should be spent in assisting the returned soldier. If that really be the object, the distribution of money proposed under this legislation is improper; the distribution should be in proportion to enlistment instead of in proportion to population. In that case the province of Alberta would

be entitled to a greater share of this appropriation than we shall get under the present proposals. If it is not the object of this legislation to assist the returned soldier, let the money be diverted to the cities to remove the slums and establish better social conditions.
I ask the minister to take into consideration my suggestion that the money should be paid to the provinces in proportion to enlistments, and not in proportion to population. Inasmuch as he has stated, and it is amply demonstrated in the Orders in Council that have been passed, that this plan is primarily for the benefit of the returned soldier-the appropriation is made from the War Vote-then let the provinces that have given the most men to fight for their country get the most money.

The War Measures Act, under which action has been taken, was passed unanimously, if I remember aright, by the House of Commons. There was not a dissenting voice, and the Government has acted only under an Act passed with the unanimous consent of the Parliament of Canada, and passed for the very purpose of giving to the Government power to act in case of emergency during the progress of the war.

Why insult members of the House by spending a whole evening discussing it when it is to be put through no matter how we discuss it?

apply for a loan under this scheme and build in the city of Ottawa a house which we could occupy for a few months in the year and which would be convenient.

I should like to know where the line is drawn. The resolution puts the maximum income of those who may apply for a loan at $3,000, and as we are paid $2,500 per session for working about fourteen hours a day, I suppose we could qualify as workingmen under the terms of this proposition.
I should also like to refer to the case of a man who is in good circumstances in life and has, say $42,000 invested in mortgages and that class of security upon which he is receiving 7 per cent per annum. Such a man could qualify under the terms of this arrangement for a loan of $4,500, and he would be a very foolish man if he did not do so, because he could borrow that sum from the Government at five per cent and lend it out at seven per cent, and on the transaction he would net the nice little sum of $90, which added to his handsome income of $2,940 obtained from the investment of $42,000 at 7 per cent, would increase his income to $3,030. Notwithstanding that fact, he could still qualify for a loan under this proposition. Unless proper safeguards are thrown around this scheme as to the manner of making the advances, this loan will go into the hands of the capitalists of the country as well as of members of Parliament who are now about to vote upon the subject.
In view of the statement made that the British Columbia and Ontario Governments have already accepted contracts submitted to them by the Federal Government, it is evident that the operation of this scheme has already begun. Why then bring this matter into this House for discussion when the operation is already settled independently of the House of Commons. It would be just as well for the House to be dismissed as to ask us here day after day to discuss measures that have already been settled by Order in Council. We are mere rubber stamps, and I did not intend to come here to be used as a rubber stamp or
anything of , that kind. The 12 m. brains of Parliament are not always included in the section of the House to the right of the Speaker; there are some brains on this side of the House, and they might be of advantage occasionally in matters of this kind.

Mr. P'EDLOW: Hon. members need not be in a hurry, as if is early yet. In view of the statement made previously this session in this House as to the enormous liabilities we have already incurred and the enormous shortage that has been admitted, a shortage, I understand, of over $100,000,000 that is staring the Minister of Finance in the face, and that no doubt is causing him a good deal of worry and is partly responsible for the delay in bringing down the Budget, the President of the Council (Mr. Rowell) should hesitate in pressing this scheme to a conclusion to-night. In view of all that, I think the time is inopportune for enforcing this proposition, and besides the amount the Government has decided to invest in this scheme is ridiculous. It will provide, on the basis of an average cost of $3,750 per house, which is the average cost of the four schemes under consideration, for the nine provinces about 629 houses to each province. It will not relieve the situation to any extent; It is a mere drop in the bucket. The House would be well advised to delay this scheme until a proper scheme is got into operation and until a more opportune time arises when money is more plentiful.

Government go on throwing around the money already received by way of loan from the people of this country, as has been the custom for the last .month or so. in this Parliament, I fancy they will have a difficult problem ahead of them to raise another loan, and whether it is called a Victory loan or a Peace loan or anything else, the Government will have difficulty in enthusing the people in the matter. I had a good deal to do locally with regard to raising the last loan, and I know from experience gained at that time that the Government have quite a difficult proposition ahead of them, especially in view of the manner in which the money is being spent. The Government is giving $25,000,000 to the provinces without agreements that we know anything of and without proper safeguards. They have advanced'

$25,000,000 to buy merchandise to eend to Roumania, $25,000,000 to buy merchandise [DOT]to send to Belgium, and an unlimited amount for France and Great Britain, and 'they have also decided to appropriate $25,000,000 for good roads. I am not finding fault with some of those schemes, but a 'limit should be put to the amounts, especially when many of them are amounts 'which are not surrounded by proper safe-guards and on which the Government is taking a big chance making a big gamble. I think the funds subscribed by the citizens of this country deserve better protection than they seem to obtain.

Hon. NEWTON W. ROWELL:	As this
proposal constitutes a very important part of the Government programme of reconstruction for this year, it is but due to the Committee and the country that I should briefly outline the proposals of the Government. The members of the Committee will recall that during the four years of the war, building operations so far at least as they related to the building of private houses, largely ceased in many cities, while in others they were very materially curtailed. So that we find ourselves at the close of the war in arrears in the normal erection of dwellings in our principal cities throughout Canada. Besides this, the war had the effect of stimulating early marriages. A large number of young men, who enlisted from the English-speaking provinces, married earlier in life than was the custom prior to the war. Not only did large numbers marry in Canada, but many thousands married in Great Britain, and they are now returning to Canada with their wives. These married soldiers, particularly those who enlisted in the larger cities and a number of our towns, are finding it exceedingly difficult if not impossible . to secure homes on their return to Canada, with the result that there has been a very great demand for increased housing accommodation. We all recognize that the home is the unit of the nation, and that it is in the national interest that a man may have opportunity to rear his family in a comfortable house of his own, equipped with modern sanitary conveniences. The fact that a man owns his own home undoubtedly induces him to

take a more practical interest in the affairs of the country and thus tends to the strength and stability of our national life.
Good housing has a great deal to do with good health. It has a great deal to do with the whole character and tone of the community. and we in Canada should guard against the repetition of what has happened in so many of the cities of the Old World where slum conditions have developed with consequent deterioration in the character of the population. However, the primary reason why the Government decided to take action was the demand for increased housing accommodation due. to the return of the soldiers to Canada, and that fact made it a matter that came within the jurisdiction of the Federal Parliament and one in which the Government must take a very lively interest.
Another consideration was the importance of providing employment, under conditions that would really add to the national wealth and the strength of the nation, for the many men who might be thrown out of employment through the cessation of war activities. Obviously, if building operations could be stimulated on a substantial scale in many of the cities and towns of Canada, suitable employment for workingmen would thus be found at remunerative wages, which would prevent the growth of unemployment and so safeguard the national interest. For these reasons the Government decided, 'after the conference held with the provincial premiers who gathered in the city of Ottawa about the latter part of November last, to take action along the lines indicated in the resolution.
Before going into the resolution I should like to point out that action to secure the same object was taken by the Government of Great Britain. Action for not quite the same object, but dealing with the housing problem in another aspect, was taken by the United States. The British Government, as hon. members will recall, for many years, by its legislation and by its administrative measures, has been endeavouring to improve the housing accommodation in the United Kingdom, and one of the existing departments there has been organized with a view to providing advice and assistance to municipalities throughout Great Britain in laying out improved sites for town planning and in erecting houses along modern lines. That machinery has been utilized as the basis for the British Government's present proposal. What is contemplated is the erection of three hundred thousand houses-that is the objective, the
minimum number, the British Government has in view. The British Government is not erecting these houses itself, but is loaning money to municipalities throughout the country that will embark in municipal housing schemes. It is also loaning money to housing companies, with restricted dividends, on favourable terms, in order that they may erect comfortable houses for the workingmen of Great Britain. I believe it is estimated that those houses will each cost on an average about £500, or $2,500. Hon. gentlemen will see what an enormous expenditure it would involve on the part of the Government of Great Britain if no less than three hundred thousand houses are erected at an estimated expenditure of $2,500 each. But the British Government look upon that expenditure, which is a loan, as I have explained, to municipalities and housing companies, as not only being in the national interest but as being necessary in order to improve social conditions. I know we all realize tliat conditions in Canada are very different from conditions in Great Britain, but nevertheless there is a shortage of houses in the Dominion for people of moderate means which this proposal is intended to meet. Personally, I do not think the federal, provincial, or municipal governments can contribute more largely to improve social conditions than by aiding in a housing programme which will ensure the erection of suitable houses equipped with modern conveniences, and with adequate breathing space and playgrounds around them where children may have an opportunity of breathing the fresh air of heaven. I do not know of any way in which they can contribute better to the social welfare of the country than by adopting this method.
With these objects in view the Government passed an Order in Council on the 3rd of December, 1918, to give effect to the decision which was arrived at at the Interprovincial Conference. I have had a large number of copies of this Order in Council distributed to hon. gentlemen so that they may have the opportunity of carefully studying its provisions. The Order in Council which was made on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, recites the reasons for making this loan. First, it refers to the Interprovincial Conference recently held in Ottawa between premiers and other members of the governments of the several provinces and members of the Dominion Government. One of the important objects discussed at the conference was that of creating better housing conditions for the industrial population of our",,,,
proceedings1919_05_16.csv,532355,ca.proc.d.1919-05-16.12.1.1.2,1919-05-16,,,,stagedirection,,,,"larger centres. Then it is pointed out that owing to the cessation of building operations during the war there is at present a great scarcity of housing accommodation in most of our cities, and that this condition will become intensified with the return of our soldiers from overseas and their re-establishment with their families in civil life and occupation. The Order proceeds:
In view of the national importance of the matter, which touches vitally the health, morals and general well-being of the entire community, and its relation to the welfare of returned soldiers and their families, together with the fact that the carrying out of such a policy on a substantial scale by provincial governments would afford considerable employment during the period of reconstruction and readjustment of industry following the war, the minister recommends as follows:
And the Committee will see here the practical proposals upon which the vote is asked to be granted:
1.	That the Minister of Finance be authorized under the provisions of the War Measures Act upon request of the government of any province of Canada to make loans to such government for the purpose mentioned.
That is the purpose I have already outlined in the preamble:
2.	That the aggregate amount to be loaned to all provinces shall not exceed $25,000,000 and the amount of loan to any one province shall not exceed the proportion of the said $25,000,000 which the population of the said province bears to the total population of Canada.
3.	That the loans made hereunder may be for a period not exceeding twenty years, with the right to any province to pay off the whole or any part of the principle of the loan at any time during the said term.
4.	That interest at the rate of five per cent per annum, payable half-yearly shall be charged upon advances from the dates thereof respectively.
5.	The Minister of Finance may accept bonds, debentures, or such other form of security as he may approve evidencing the indebtedness of any provincial government for loans made hereunder.
6.	Advances shall be made from the War Appropriation.
7.	Advances may be made as soon as a general scheme of housing shall have been agreed upon between the Government of Canada and the government of the province applying for a loan hereunder.
I would like to point out in passing that the rate of interest at five per cent is a lower rate than the rate at which the Government could borrow the money. The Government to that extent was rendering direct practical assistance towards the construction of houses under this programme. If the provincial governments loan at the same rate of interest, it means that the working man, particularly the returned soldier, will be able to acquire his house and

lot at a rate of interest on the investment very much below the rate at which he could possibly secure it under existing conditions from private sources-.
Of course, at the present time-indeed, at any time a workman could not expect to get nearly, the full amount necessary to purchase the property and erect the house. If he did get the full amount it would be only by means of a second mortgage on which he would have to pay a very high rate of interest. To arrange for a rate of interest of not more than 5 per cent on the total amount that he is called upon to borrow from the Provincial Government is a very substantial contribution by this Government to the building cost.",,,,

MR. ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"That is- correct. I shall not go through the various general principles and standards which are recommended to the provinces. Hon. members will find them on pages 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Order in Council. I will, however, mention two which appear to be of particular importance. Number 1 is:
Acquisition of Sites, etc.-The success of the housing movement depends upon the acquirement of suitable land at its fair value, and at a cost which working men can afford to pay.
It is essential, therefore, that statutory provision shall ' be made by the provinces for a cheap and speedy method of compulsory taking of the land required for housing purposes. To facilitate proper planning and to secure economy in connection with housing schemes comparatively large sites should as a rule be chosen so as to permit of comprehensive treatment. Such sites should be conveniently accessible to places of employment, means of transportation, water supply, sewers and other public utilities.
It is the first part of the clause to which I direct attention. All who have taken an interest in this question of housing, particularly for workingmen, must realize that one of the difficulties in our larger cities is the very high cost of land, especially in the majority of our larger cities. Add to this the high cost of building, and you have such a charge upon the workingman's income as to make it difficult for him to live in such a house as he and his family should be entitled to live in. If you must -proceed by expropriation of land for a housing scheme-I am speaking now particularly from the standpoint of Ontario, with the laws of which I am familiar-if you took proceedings under the law regarding expropriation, and you had finally to pay what might thus be decided, after hearing experts on both sides, one boosting the price up and the other trying to beat it down, you would delay the operation of the scheme so that you would not secure the desired result. The Government, therefore, suggest this proposition. I know Ontario has adopted it; I do not know how far the other provinces have done so, but they have provided a .cheap and speedy method of settling the value of property where they Tequire to expropriate. The other principle to which I desire to direct attention is No. 4 which reads:
Limit of income of persons to be provided with dwellings.-In order to ensure that the money shall be loaned to those who most need it, no person In receipt of an income exceeding $3,000 per annum should be eligible as a purchaser or tenant of a house erected with the aid of Government funds in any schemes carried out by provincial governments, municipalities, housing associations or owners of lots.

We do not stipulate that as a condition, but we suggest to the provinces that they should stipulate it as a condition in order that a man of means, who can afford to pay a higher rate of interest and get the money from private sources, should not use this money which is intended for different purposes.

ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"If I may be permitted to bring the thoughts of the hon. member and the Committee back to the subject under consideration, I would like to offer a few observations with respect to the general question covered by this proposal, and the broad methods outlined by it. For twenty-five years I have been deeply interested in the matter of the housing of the working people, and have had some personal experience which may perhaps at this juncture, be of some value to the Committee. '
I want in the first place to congratulate the Government upon this venture in, I will admit, entirely new and untried fields, but a venture which I hope will be received by the provinces in the spirit in which it is made, and a venture which I hope may bring fruit from co-operation with all those other organizations whose assistance is necessary to make this ia success. I have listened with very close attention to what the minister has said, and I have read the memorandum which he has submitted with some care, and I must say that in one respect I feel disappointed in the proposed measure, tl am quite willing that the returned soldier should be assisted in securing a home; I am quite willing that the workingman should find it possible to build a residence in the outskirts of a city; but I jeel that this money, if it is to do the most good, should be expended in the centre of the big cities where the slum conditions exist. The proposition as it at present stands, I think, does not meet that need.
I had occasion some years ago to make an intimate social study of the constituency which I represent in (Montreal, and I know that the conditions which were found then still persist to-day, and probably will continue to persist until they

are dealt with by the Dominion or Provincial Governments in a drastic way. There are districts in the constituency I represent where five hundred human beings live on an acre. There are blocks in the constituency I represent where, if every man, woman and child in that block should go and stand shoulder to shoulder they would make a line entirely round the four sides of the block on the four streets. When you come to undertake a building scheme in an area like that, what do you find? You find that the properties are held by scores of proprietors. You may acquire a little space here, by paying for it; you may acquire a little space there; but you cannot acquire an area that will be sufficiently large to let light and air into the district and thus do .some real benefit. There will always be some proprietors who will hold you up for a large amount or will not sell at all-and I am very glad to see that this (Bill not only contains the necessary financial provisions, but also the power of expropriation which is absolutely necessary if you are to improve any of the slum areas of our great cities.
Now the city of Montreal, as hon. gentlemen know, lies between the beautiful mountain and the still more beautiful river. The space available for habitation is limited, unless you go away out to the north or away out to the west. There are immense industries down near the water front. These industries employ large numbers of men, women and children. They open early and they close late, and the working people have to be at their employment sometimes before sun-up in the morning, and remain there until after sun-down at night. They cannot live three, four, or five miles out in the suburbs in the beautiful little homes you propose to build for them; many of them being night workers as well, they must live in the centre of the city near their work. I remember twenty years ago in my city making an industrial census of an area which contained thirty thousand people, and ascertaining the wages, the rents, the sanitary conditions, the number of rooms occupied, the death rate, the crime rate, and ia great many other figures in connection with it. Then, after ascertaining what was the social condition of the thirty thousand people that lived there, we were able to put up a certain number of model dwellings in the place where they were most needed, and where the largest number of people had to dwell to be near their work. And more, as a result of the study we were, able to determine what rent

they could pay, the number of rooms they would be able to occupy, and the class of accommodation they should seek; and I want to say as one who has had experience with this problem that there is no work that a human being can undertake in a big city that brings in greater returns of satisfaction than an investment well placed for the housing of working people. You sometimes are told that they do not appreciate property of that kind. You sometimes are told that they will not pay the rent. That has not been my experience. I cannot say that the properties have yielded six per cent, but I can say that there is never a vacant house for more than a week, and that there are forty families who are always grateful and self-respecting.
I would like to see many of the areas in the city of Montreal that are slufns wiped out. I would like to see it possible for a building corporation, or -an individual, or a group of citizens, to select the worst area there is in the city, wipe out four or five blocks, and re-plan those blocks so that there would be plenty of playground space, so that all the courts would be paved, and so that there would be elbow room for the people that live in that block. I do not think you can do that under this Bill.
As far as I can see this Bill provides that the houses must be -practically individual houses. Suppose you start to build individual houses in a congested part of the city of Montreal. You cannot put one of these little cottages on a lot less than twenty-five feet front by eighty feet depth. There is an area of two thousand feet right away. You would have to pay at least $2.50 a foot for that property. That would represent an immediate expenditure of $5,000, and if you put another $2,500 into the building, which is the smallest amount you could possibly use to -house a family, you have a total of $7,500 to provide a dwelling for one single family. The only way in which that can be done is by erecting buildings of a size sufficient to enable three or four families to live one above another. In that way you can spread the cost of your land over the four families, and you can bring it within the allowance that is permitted here. It would seem to me that instead of using our money out in the suburbs, where there is already plenty of air and light, in building nice little houses with a garden patch and plenty of space around them, which would be done by the ordinary speculator and land developer anyway, we should do what these other men will not do-go into
the heart of the city, take the most congested area you can find, and use this money in turning a place which is a byword and a hissing in the neighbourhood into a place where a hundred families can live decently, comfortably and under conditions that would put them near their work, enable them to send their children to school, and enable them to live in a comfortable and happy -way together.
I think the Government has made a splendid advance in this direction, but I would like it to give serious consideration as to whether this scheme is really meeting the [DOT] congested city area difficulty. We speak of building for the returned soldier. Well, this, in a sense, '.ve do. Still, I do not suppose that these houses are -to be exclusively retained for the returned soldier; the necessity for them is in a large degree created by the return of the soldier. Now, I know from the returns of -the Patriotic Fund that during the war a great many families doubled up; that is, a couple of soldiers' families lived together. Now that the men are coming back we have the same report from - every one of our large cities: they cannot find homes for the re-con-stituted soldiers' families.
In Toronto in our rest rooms we keep families for a long time while the ladies of the Patriotic Fund search up and down the streets trying to find a place where they can be housed. And one of the most difficult problems we have in Montreal is to find adequate accommodation for the newly-linked up and reconstituted families that have returned from overseas. So I trust the Government will get on with this scheme as speedily as possible, for the present condition will grow worse unless it is quickly remedied, and the sooner we get it remedied the better it will be for this country in the years to come.
There is one canny feature in connection with the scheme that I cannot help admiring from the financial point of view, in that it involves no addition to the permanent debt of the country. The Government, it is true, is providing $25,000,060, but it is loaning that sum, and whatever it adds to the debit side it will add to the credit side, and consequently the net debt of the country will not be increased. Those who view with alarm the very rapid increase of our national debt will be glad to see that at least one expenditure is bound to be reimbursed. Therefore so far as the investment feature is concerned no criticism can be coming to the Government. But I trust

they will arrange to utilize a fair share of this money for the purpose of wiping out those blots on our modern civilization which every large city has to-day-the old broken-down buildings, held by some speculator at a rack rent, unfit to live in, and yet not condemned and not removed, but which, if replaced with decent dwellings, would support a contented population.

MR. ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"I shall have an opportunity of expressing my opinion on that point when the Budget is brought down. I have the greatest respect for the opinions of the member for Red Deer (Mr. Michael Clark). I almost always find myself in agreement with him, but I am not wholly in agreement with him on this matter. If the result of this proposal is to provide houses for forty thousand people, it will be 162
a very real factor in the solution of the housing problem in our cities. Moreover, by erecting a good type of workingman's house, sanitary in all its appointments, with a breathing space around it, under the conditions outlined in these Orders in Council, you set a standard for workingmen's houses whioh should affect-experience shows that it does affect-all other workingmen's houses erected in the same town or city. You improve the general character of the workingman's house when you have a good type of house erected, because men prefer the better rather than the less favourable.
My hon. friend thinks that there is a danger of our copying legislation enacted in other countries without considering whether it is adaptable to our own country.
I cannot agree with him in that. I frankly recognize that the adoption of some policy in Great Britain is not necessarily a reason why it should be adopted here, the conditions in the two countries are, as my hon. friend has said, very different. We have this immense expanse of territory; we have these great opportunities in Canada; but the startling and the disappointing fact is that notwithstanding the potentiality of these great unoccupied areas we are^rapidly developing slum conditions in our larger cities. I think that we should profit by the experience of Great Britain. My hon. friend has paid me he compliment of assuming that I have looked into this matter: I tried to get all the information I could when I was in Great Britain in reference to their housing policies and programme. I visited some of their garden cities and discussed the matter with experts of the British Board of Trade. In 191J, when in Great Britain, I discussed with Right Hon. John Burns, who was then President of the Local Government Board and who had direction of the housing scheme, the various pieces of social legislation which the Lloyd George Government had introduced in Great Britain. I said to him: ""Suppose we decided to make a start in Canada on this social legislation, which one of your various measures do you think we could adopt with the greatest profit?"" Without a moment's hesitation, he said: ""Housing and town planning."" He went on to say that he was astonished beyond measure to see the conditions in some of our cities. He mentioned particularly what was known as ""Shacktown"" in the northern part of Toronto. He emphasized the fact that in a well laid-out district, where the people live in clean and com-

fortable houses, you have people who are more law-abiding and better citizens than they would be if they were brought up amid disorderly slum conditions. These things have a real effect, he said, upon the character of the people-upon their outlook, upon their respect for and observance of the law. That really is one of the fundamental questions to which my hon. friend has referred. I do not doubt that the other is a fundamental question; bu't I believe that the provision of good, clean, sanitary houses is fundamental to the best social conditions in this or any other country.
In my investigation into this matter I have actually looked into the housing conditions in my own city of Toronto. In the winter of 1914, when unemployment was very conspicuous, I took occasion to visit many of the homes in the poorer districts of the city. I went in and talked to the people, I saw the conditions under which they were living; and I have no hesitation in saying that it is a disgrace that with all our natural resources and advantages, such conditions of housing and poverty should exist. It is our 'bounden duty, by every possible measure that we can adopt, to try to improve these conditions.
My hon. friend has suggested that one particular measure might solve the problem. To-night is not the time to enter into a discussion of that question; we shall get that on the Budget. Only as a justification for this measure, not in answer to my hon. friend on the other point, I suggest that although Great Britain has enjoyed the benefits of free trade for the last sixty or seventy years, she does experience these conditions of unequal distribution of wealth in a most acute form. In other words, that one measure to which my hon. friend referred has not brought about an equitable distribution of wealth. I agree that measures should be taken to help meet the condition; we cannot go on in the future with the unequal disr tribution of wealth that has prevailed in the past. I believe that that unequal distribution is in a very .substantial measure responsible for the world-wide social unrest. We must recognize the fact that in the future division of the results of the joint effort of labour and capital, labour must have a larger share, and any wise administrative act that may be carried out with a view 'to bringing about this result will tend to improve and stabilize social and industrial conditions.
The horn member (Sir Herbert Ames) said that he thought these proposals did

not meet a condition which existed in Montreal. This scheme does cover the duplex house-the two-story house-which is almost a standard house in certain sections of that city. With reference to the larger problem that my hon. friend has suggested, I recognize its great importance. He has made a real contribution to the discussion in what he has 'told us of the situation in his own city and of the steps which might be taken to relieve it. But I am rather of the opinion that a condition of that kind is a question to be taken up and dealt with by the city itself. That is the way these questions have been dealt with in Great Britain. Whole sections of the city of London have been cut right through with a view to opening up a highway between certain sections of the city. The result is that they have cleared out the old houses in the district through which this street runs, and by appropriating the land and laying it out with this fine highway running through it they have been able, through the increased selling value of the land bordering on the highway, largely to recoup themselves for the expenditure incurred in that connection.
I am rather of the opinion, while I do not know the conditions in Montreal, that if any one took up the proposition and undertook to clear up certain of those sections, and lay them out in improved style, the city should not be a great loser by the cost of doing it. In othef words, the return, under the improved conditions, should compensate the city for the outlay in clearing up the situation.

MR. ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"I have listened to my hon. friend with very great interest. He has presented very clearly the views of the people of Saskatoon as they have been communicated to us. Let me point out that this matter first came up at the Interprovincial Conference at the instance of one of the provinces to see if the Dominion Government would loan the money. All the provinces were represented. Hon. Mr. Martin, Hon. Mr. Motherwell, Hon. Mr. Dunning, and Hon. Mr. Turgeon representing Saskatchewan. The matter was discussed, and the Dominion Government decided that it would make advances to the provinces, imposing certain conditions which I have outlined. Therefore it is a provincial scheme with Federal co-operation.
With reference to imposing an obligation on the municipalities, this Governmeut does not impose any such obligation. This Government loans the money to the province. The province itself may loan it direct to the applicants for loans; it may loan it to housing companies, citizens organized for the purpose of erecting suitable houses, or it may loan it to municipalities; it may loan it to private individuals, or it may buy land itself and develop it. The province has full and complete jurisdiction over the matter, and it is purely a question between the municipality and the province as to whether any obligation should be imposed upon the municipality.
With reference to the Government changing its policy and loaning to municipalities or handing the money over to them for administration, I can only say that the Government has considered the representations which have been made to that effect. We have not seen our way clear to adopt that suggestion and I think my hon. friend
will agree that the Government would be assuming a very great responsibility if it turned over large sums of money to various municipalities throughout the province for them to administer without having any direct control over such administration. It would be changing the whole basis upon which this policy is framed.
As to the high cost of building, -and the fact that there might be some loss conse-auent upon building at the present time while we all hope that present conditions will not become the normal condition and that the cost of building will be reduced,
I am afraid that there is not the evidence of a decline in the cost of building which a good many people thought would come about after the signing of the armistice. In view of the rate of wages being paid and being demanded, and in view of many other considerations entering into the cost of building, it does not seem probable that we shall get back for many years to come, if ever, to the conditions which prevailed prior to the war. Therefore, people should not be deterred from building at the present time. A private citizen seeking to borrow the whole amount necessary to build a house-as he could under this scheme could not get it in my hon. friend's province at less than over eight per cent.

Although we all recognize without the slightest reserve the ability of those gentlemen who compose the Cabinet Committee that dealt with this matter in council, this debate has showed very clearly that there are in this House opinions and views and experience which would have been valuable to the Government in drafting this legislation. Why was this plan effected by Order in Council instead of being introduced in this House by a Bill founded upon a resolution? It will be stated that Parliament was not sitting. Why was not Parliament sitting in the month of December? Parliament rose in the latter days of May, 1918; the armistice was signed in November, but Parliament was not summoned to meet until almost the end of February. I believe that the Government should not have launched upon a scheme absolutely new in this country, an absolute departure from anything the Government had done before without consulting the representatives of the people. I believe that if the Government had consulted the representatives of the people they would have got a very much better plan than the one before us to-night.
My next submission is that this discussion is more or less of an academic character. The scheme must be worked in cooperation with the provinces. The provinces have been consulted upon a plan prepared by Order in Council, and many of them have formulated theii schemes on the plan submitted to them Therefore, although the minister kindly pays the closest and most courteous attention to our suggestion, after all the matter is largely concluded, and it is practically impossible for us at this time, even if we were able to convince the minister that we were right, to change the plan. That only goes to prove how well it is to stick to sound constitutional usage, and not to attempt short cuts. Very often the shortest road to any objective is the travelled road -the road which is lighted by the lamps of experience.
There were some good suggestions offered by the hon. member for St. Antoine whose contribution to the evening's discussion was most valuable. I agree with the minister on that score, but he seemed to think that the member for Red Deer had been beside the point because he had spoken about fundamentals. Suppose that instead of being called upon to give his opinion upon a national question, the member for Red Deer had been summoned as a physician and had found the patient lying on the bed in a superheated room suffering from fever, while the member for St. Antoine was busy administering a small homeopathic pill. And suppose the member for Red Deer had ordered the windows to be thrown open to let in the air. Would he have gone beyond his duty as a medical practitioner? I do not think so, and my opinion is that he was absolutely within his province as a member of the House when he said-and I agree With every word that he said-that the present measure is a mere palliative, and that this country can never prosper under the application of palliatives. It is jijst as if a man came in hungry after a hard day's work and were offered a little cube of beef tea. We have overcrowding in this country in some of the large cities, and this proposal will not obviate such overcrowding. Men will live near their work if they possibly can. and what the member for St. Antoine said is absolutely right, that putting up nice houses of $3,000, $4,000 and $4,500 in pleasant suburbs will not remove congestion in the congested parts of cities. What are the slums due to? They are due, I take it, among other things to a bad system of municipal taxation. I think this has more to do with congestion than perhaps almost anything else, and that is something that is not in the purview of this House. Then I believe that effective means of transportation have a great deal to do with slum congestion; and thirdly slum congestion in our large cities is, I think, due to a false and unsound economic practice which this country has been following for thirty years and more. This is a time of reconstruction,

and it is a time for the Canadian people to examine these questions to the very core and make up their minds as to what is the right thing to do. I am afraid that this is a mere palliative. We have all sorts of plasters in the pharmacopoeia and this is almost a shinplaster. If we take the average cost of houses at $3,500-they run as -I understand it from 83,000 to $4,500 -I am afraid that at the present 'cost of building, the houses will probably cost nearer the larger than the smaller figure. But let us take the next smallest figure as our basis, $3,500. If we divide the $25,000,000 by $3,500, we have 7,142 houses. Let us suppose that the average family will consist of five persons, and we shall have 35,710 persons to be accommodated. Now, this is not restricted to the returned soldier; anybody can get it by meeting the necessary requirements. As it is not mentioned that the applicant is to be a returned soldier, the authorities administering the Act must of necessity take applications as they come forward indiscriminately as to whether they are returned soldiers or not. If they did not, they would not be carrying out the intention of the legislation. I think that if we find housing accommodation for two or three regiments we shall be accomplishing as much as we can expect, and therefore I am very much afraid that we are going to spend a great deal of money and will not help the returned soldiers to any large extent. The member for St. Antoine said that we would not be increasing the financial debt by this system. Well, if all the money is well laid out and is all paid back we shall only lose the difference between what it costs us to borrow the money and what is paid back, but meanwhile we shall increase the debt although the net debt will not be increased by a large amount. I am not altogether opposed to this measure, although I do not think it is a wise one. I am thoroughly convinced that under our federal system it would be infinitely better for such matters as this to be dealt with by the municipalities or the provinces. If that is not done you are going to have the spectacle which *we see now of trying to suggest types of houses for half a continent with climates and local, physical and geographical conditions altogether different. The plan which has been laid down for houses may be quite suitable to Nova Scotia and be absolutely inapplicable to Alberta, and this, I think is a very serious defect. It is centralization as against decentralization and as a rule in matters of administration I prefer [Mr. McMaster.J
the system of decentralization. Of this I am thoroughly convinced and my words are borne out by what the Minister of Labour said yesterday or the day before in another place, that we cannot expect to have lower cost of living in Canada until we get more people on the land. And if you are going to endeavour by governmental aid to effect a return to proper living conditions, it is your duty to encourage the	flow of	population	from	thecity	to the	soil, which	will not
be done by this project. The scheme does not contemplate the building of farm cottages for farm servants, and I think that one thing that would help the development of rural life in Canada would be this assistance to farmers where necessary, in the furnishing of proper building accommodation, in order that a man who had a liking for country life might find proper accommodation for himself and his family. I believe that one of 'the obstacles that keep people from rural pursuits is the fact that the young man who goes on the farm has to live with his employer, very often to the disadvantage of the latter, as well as unpleasant to the hired man, who likes to have a time for himself away from his daily work. But the great obstacle to the development of farm life is the fact that the hired man cannot look forward to marriage because he cannot get a house of his own with facilities for founding a family. I believe that this proposal is absolutely wanting; that it fails to go to the root of the matter in view of the fact that i't makes no provision for the development of proper living conditions in the rural parts of the country.

I would like the minister to state now, if he can, whether or not the proposition can be limited to a man who has got an income of, say, $1,800 a year?

ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"We in Western Canada, particularly in the city which I represent, when the Order in Council providing for this housing scheme was passed early in the year, were very much taken with it. But since that time, conferring in our cities with our Provincial Government as to how the scheme is to be worked out, we find that it does not seem to be making the progress expected, and does not appeal to our people so strongly as it did at the first blush. In Western Canada our country is new, and our cities are of recent growth, and we have not the slums that exist in some of the eastern cities which have been mentioned this evening.

Nevertheless, we have an acute shortage of houses. In my own city since the House assembled I have had to get permission from the Public Works Department for the use of the local immigration hall to house returned soldiers and their families, there being no places of residence available.
What our people object to is that although this is taken hold of as a national scheme, it is hardly fair that the municipality should be saddled with the financial responsibility, that is, to the extent of reducing its borrowing power. Apparently the policy as propounded by our provincial government was for them to accept the money from the Dominion Government and pass it on to the city authorities, that money then becoming a charge against the borrowing power of the city. Now, during the past four years all public works in Western Canada practically ceased, with the result that at the present time many public works are needed, and the municipal authorities feel that the urgency for those public works is so great that it will take up pretty well all their borrowing powers to finance them. Therefore they do not wish to load those borrowing powers with this extra burden, viewing it as a national scheme.
I would like to ask the minister if he thinks it possible in any way to so work out the scheme that the money can be advanced the same as it is in Great Britain, the national Government taking the full responsibility of advancing to the municipalities, leaving them to administer the loan? Our people view with some little apprehension the present high cost of building material, and they feel that in four or five years there will be a considerable depreciation in property corresponding with the depreciation in the prices of building materials, with a possible loss to them. In the British housing scheme the Government bears 75 per cent of that loss. To sum up, I have here a clipping from a newspaper which gives the views of our cities as expressed in a resolution passed at a convention held to discuss this matter. It reads:
Resolved that this meeting of delegates from towns and cities in the province of Saskatchewan is of opinion that the proper housing of the workers and returned soldiers at this time is extremely urgent and is a national question, and requests the provincial Government in cooperation with the other provincial Governments of Canada to bring the matter before the Dominion Government and urge it to assume all responsibility in financing housing schemes, the municipalities being made responsible only for administration.

I received a communication a few days ago from an association in our city requesting me to bring this to the attention of the Government. At the present time, so far as we are concerned, unless there is some change of our view point, it seems that we are not likely to take any advantage of this scheme, althougn when it was first mentioned our city of Saskatoon went so far as to make application for a loan of $500,000; but when they found it was to he made a direct Charge against their borrowing power they felt it was not of such very great advantage to borrow from the Government. At the present time we could borrow $500,000 from other sources, but might have to pay a cent and a half more interest.

MR. ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"Probably he could not get it on any terms. But assuming that he could go into the market and get the bulk of the money, it would cost him eight per cent for at least fifty per cent of the amount required, and he would have to pay a good deal more for the next twenty-five or thirty per cent 'if he was able to-obtain it. That means that the total loan -if he could get it- would probably cost him nine or ten per cent. When he gets it under this scheme at five per cent on the twenty-year payment plan, the Government is contributing twenty-five or thirty per cent of the cost, because of the lower rate of interest. I think the cost is not likely to be reduced below that figure for many years to come. A workingman who builds a house within the next few years with money borrowed at five per cent for twenty years and with the right to pay back principal and interest will not be a dollar out of pocket and will be in no less favourable position than the man who builds his house three, four or five years hence. In fact, I am inclined to think that he will be money in pocket, on the basis of that rate of interest and plan of repayment.

The member for Brome (Mr. McMaster) objects, first, because we did not bring down a Bill when Parliament met, instead of taking action by Order in Council; and, second, because, he says, this is only a palliative. Why did we act before Parliament met? For several reasons. First, the provinces wanted to know what the Dominion was going to do in ordeT that they might formulate their own plans. Second, the provinces wanted to know at once the terms on which they could get the ihoney. Third, if housing was to be proceeded with this spring, it was necessary that the provinces should have this information at once in order that they might proceed with their plansi. Fourth, the soldiers were returning; they were in need of houses, and it was essential that progress should he made in providing houses for them. An additional reason was that employment might be available this spring to help meet the anticipated serious unemployment because immediately after the armistice was signed last November the majority of the people looked forward to a serious condition of unemployment. The Government felt, therefore, that in order to meet the conditions it was well within their power to agree with the Provincial Governments to make these advances on the terms they did.
My hon. friend referred to the question of orders in Council. I admit that the question whether the Government should act in a particular matter by Order in Council or by a Bill is a proper one for discussion and for legitimate difference of opinion. I promised the committee the other evening, when we were discussing the Northwest Mounted Police Estimates, that I would make a statement with regard to the matter of Orders in Council. But we went on to discuss other points, and I passed over it. As the hon. member for Brome has brought it up on this occasion, I shall say1 a word on the subject now.
I think it' was an article in Le Devoir that first brought forcibly home to me the enormity of the offences which I was committing as President of the Council in grinding out so many Orders in Council. It was stated in that paper that more Orders in Council had been passed in one year while I was President of the Council than had been passed in eighteen or twenty years previously. I think the number of years stated was eighteen or twenty; in any ease, it was very many years. I really commenced to think that I must be a very 
bad man indeed if so many Orders in 'Council were being turned out while I was President of the Council.

I am very glad to find courtesy, and I have no reason to complain of the courtesy of hon. gentlemen on the other side. The hon. member for North Perth (Mr. Morphy)-and I am sorry he is not in the House-thought that he had occasion to refer to myself and the hon. member for Brome (Mr. McMaster), by saying that we were not on friendly terms.
He is entirely misinformed; he
II p.m. is almost lacking in information in that regard as the President of the Council is about this Housing scheme. Let me assure the hon. member for North Perth that, while there are many [things on which he could with profit look over to this side of the House for information and light and guidance, when he is looking for quarrels and schemes and divisions and subterfuges, he can find plenty of that in the Government and in the benches on his own side of the House without coming over here. Let me assure him again: The Opposition is getting along quietly, nicely, with the very best of feeling, not only amongst themselves, but with their friends on the other side of the House.
I refrained purposely from saying anything about this housing proposition, as I really had no fixed ideas about it, simply because of the way in which this has been put through. It is a new idea, a new scheme, a new principle in this country, and whenever people launch upon a new principle, the matter should come before Parliament and be threshed out in the form of a resolution and legislation passed based upon that resolution. That is the constitution and the safe way to proceed. The President of the Council says that he findsmany Orders

in Council passed in different years and not many more since the war than 'before. That is not the question, and as the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) has said, a comparison of those figures does not make us any wiser. We do not complain that the War Measures Act was passed, that that power was given to the Government, but we claim that the Government has put constructions on that Act and has done things under it which they should not have done; that they have strained the powers which were given to them under that Act, and that the powers given to them under that Act should be interpreted by the Government in the light of the reasons for which that Act was passed. It is a well known principle that history must be read according to the conditions at the time at which it was written, and Acts of Parliament ought to be construed by courts or Governments according [DOT]to the reasons for which they were passed. 'Will the President of the Council, with his training as a lawyer, say that Parliament, when this Act was being passed, had in mind that it should be used for the purpose of putting railroads into liquidation or [DOT]appointing receivers for railways put into [DOT]liquidation? No man would think of such [DOT]a thing at the time; but the President of the Council, and the rest of the Government, have used this Act for that purpose [DOT]and for many other things equally as bad. We on this side of the House say that there [DOT]is no justification whatever for using the War Measures Act for any portion of this [DOT]housing scheme except one. The minister would be perfectly justified, and the people of this country would justify him, in using [DOT]that power in order to provide homes for [DOT]returned soldiers, if that is necessary. The [DOT]minister's department is not the department in which returned soldiers should be looked after. We have a Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment, with a minister at the head of it, and it has all the necessary machinery and ought to look after the returned soldier in every phase of his requirements. Why not, then, leave the housing of the returned soldier to that department? If it is in a position to bring *in here proper information as to the scale of housing required in the different cities [DOT]and towns for the returned soldier, and if [DOT]those requirements are properly set forth [DOT]in Parliament, there would be no criticism [DOT]at all. But here is a scheme which does not touch the returned soldier *more than any body else. Everybody and 
everything are put into the boiling-pot, and, as has been pointed out by some of the supporters of the Government, the wealthy man, the capitalist can take advantage of this scheme to get cheap money and build houses which he can rent at any price he thinks fit. I submit-the minister is not to blame for this-that the Government has not the information on this subject which they should have. They simply jumped at a conclusion, passed an Order in Council under the War Measures Act, and accepted the scheme of the provinces whatever it was. The members on this side of the House have often complained of the armies of commissions that have been appointed by this Government for different reasons, some of them good, some very bad. I submit that during the last ten years no scheme has been submitted by a Government in this country that would more fully justify the appointment of a commission to inquire into and report on the conditions than this very subject of housing. A commission is travelling through the country to-day on the very proper mission of ascertaining the social and industrial conditions of the country, and I submit that one of the matters that that commission could legitimately and properly inquire into is this very question of housing. They would then be able to tell the Government what was really required, and the minister could bring down to the Houise information that would be of ' value and which would justify us in agreeing to the expenditure of this money. But that information is not here, that inquiry has not been made. Without the slightest intention of being unkind or lacking in courtesy, let me say that in my judgment we are not in possession, much letes is the Government in possession of the detailed information that they should have about this scheme before launching upon a loan of $25,000,000 of money which they have not got. If they had the money it would be all very well, but they have to borrow this money from somebody else, and then lend it to somebody ellse who is going to lend it to somebody else. It is only in the most extreme and necessitous cases that we should undertake to spend money in view of the financial conditions of the country to-day. Tf we can by any possibility get along as we have been getting along for the latet ten or fifteen years, let us try to do so until the financial condition of the country improves. It is represented to us by members of the Government who have addressed themselves to the question of national fin-

ance that we are short some hundreds of millions of dollars of what we need. In face of these conditions we find the Government proposing to borrow $20,000,000 for highways, $25,000,000 for housing, and from $25,000,000 to $100,000,000 to create trade with foreign countries. The debt of this country is something over two billion dollars; our revenue is falling off, and our sources of revenue are less promising. These are the conditions which the Government should take well into consideration before launching upon schemes to borrow money which we can do without. The hon. member for Broine has very well said that a housing scheme belongs naturally to cities and provinces. The laws to-day are too lax respecting the way in which concerns who hire men look after them. In the province of Nova Soctia, though it is not very large, we have thousands upon thousands of working men, and as a rule they are very well housed. In the town of Glace Bay in Cape Breton, you will see thousands upon thousands of workmen's, houses, each with its plot of land and all the equipment necessary for comfort. The different companies for which these men work are obliged to keep the houses up in that style, or they could not get the men to work for them. If the manufacturers and other large employers of labour throughout the country were given to understand that one of the-conditions under which they would be permitted to hire men and carry on their business was that their employees should be properly housed, we would be beginning at the right end. We would be dealing with the people who had the power to bring about the right conditions, and if it was necessary, money could be lent to them. That would be better than beginning where we are beginning now, because from what information I have been able to gather from the minister, a poor man cannot take advantage of this plan at all. It is mere talk so far as the poor man is concerned. If anybody wants to borrow money from the Government he must show that he owns the land and that he is in a position to make a start. It is very much like going to a land company to borrow.

ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"I desire once more to protest against the manner in which we are called upon to vote this $25,000,000, This expenditure ought to have gone through the usual channel. The item in the Estimates says that this $25,000,000 is to encourage the erection of dwelling houses in congested districts. In the discussion that has taken place this evening suggestions have been made that the money could be used to buy suburban lots or to

create new subdivisions, to have new towns planned, and so on. My hon. friend contends that it was necessary to invoke the War Measures Act and pass an Order in Council. I think he is going too far. The Order in Council was passed on 3rd December, 1918, but the armistice was signed in November, 1918, and the War Measures Act, as has been remarked by my hon. leader, did not contemplate such things as this. If any power can be derived from the War Measures Act in com nection with the present measure, it is under section 6 of the Act, the marginal note of which reads, ""Special .powers of Governor in Council."" The general clause of the War Measures Act says that it shall cease to have force and effect upon proclamation of the Governor, duly published, that the wax is at an end. Section 3 of the Act says that the provisions of section 6 shall only be enforced during the war, invasion, or insurrection, real or apprehended. We need not quibble on words. We know very well that to all intents and purposes the war ceased with the signing o>f the armistice, and in fact demobilization started from that time. The Order in Council was subsequent to that, and there is no justification whatever for the Government introducing this estimate based on an Order in Council. Generally when the Government want money they introduce a resolution and a Bill is presented. The resolution is discussed and the Bill is put through its various stages, and when it is agreed upon it becomes a concrete statute and every citizen of Canada can refer to it and know where to find it. I do not want to bore the Committee but I certainly desire to register my protest against this procedure, and will go further. We have not been credited on this side of the House with a superabundance of loyalty, but I may say that we never created such a condition of things as to make the representative of the King in this country falsify himself or break his promise. Yet this is what the President of the Council is doing to-day. 'On the 20th of February, 1919, an extra of the Canada Gazette contained the following:
Chamber of the Senate.
Ottawa, Thursday, the 20th February, 1919.
This day, at three o'clock, p.m., His Excellency the Governor Genaral proceeded in state to the Chamber of the Senate, in the Parliament Buildings, and took his seat upon the Throne. The members of the Senate being assembled, His Excellency was pleased to command the attendance of the House of Commons, and that House being present, His Excellency was pleased to open the Second Session

of the Thirteenth Parliament of the Dominion of Canada with the following Speech :-
In this speech I find the following-
Tour attention will also be invited to Bills providing for aid in the construction of highways, etc.
I pass that paragraph. The other paragraph says:
Bills will also be submitted for the promotion of vocational education; for the creation of a Department of Public Health; for promoting better housing conditions throughout the Dominion by loans made for the purpose to the several provincial governments, and for the validation toy Parliament of Orders in Council prohibiting the importation and manufacture of intoxicating beverages,-
and so on. It will be observed that in this speech by the Governor made to both Houses of Parliament it is promised that during the present session a Bill will be introduced providing for a better housing scheme. But what have we to-day to discuss? We are called upon to discuss an item which occupies about five or six lines in the Estimates, and no Bill has yet been introduced. Will my hon. friend explain why the promise contained in the speech from the Throne has not been kept, and why he is now proceeding by Order in Council when section 3 of the War Measures Act limits the general powers contained therein to the end of the war, the provisions of section 6 being in force, to use the words of the Act, only "" during the war, invasion, or insurrection real or apprehended?"" My hon. friend knows as well as I do that the war has ceased, and if he did not know, the great rejoicings that occurred at the signing of the armistice would certainly convince any one that at least it was taken for granted that at that time the war had come to an end. And when that time arrived section 6 of the War Measures Act which gave special powers to the Governor in Council ceased to be of effect. My hon. friend so well understood that, and that it was necessary to confirm the Order in Council of 3rd December and have its provisions embodied in legislation, that he advised His Excellency the Governor General to include in the speech from the Throne the promise that a Bill would be presented in order that there might be no equivocation as to authority and that the House could understand the matter fully and discuss it in detail. As has been remarked by some one preceding me, this is a new departure in policy, it is a new experiment, and my hon. friend the President of the Council will agree with me that we cannot discuss this measure which is before us to-night in pamphlet

form as adequately as we could a Bill. When a Bill gets its second reading it goes before the Committee and every section is discussed, and we can get all the information that we require. But this thing is in the form of a recommendation, and absolute power is vested in the Governor in Council, notwithstanding the promise made in the speech from the Throne that the matter would be left to be dealt with by Parliament in the form of a Bill.
There is another ground for objection. The President of the Privy Council knows as well as I do-because by reason of his position he is aware of the Orders in Council that go through-that it is very hard for any one to keep track of all the Orders in Council that are passed; whereas when legislation is submitted in the form of a Bill members are enlightened and cannot plead ignorance. It is not difficult, however, to plead ignorance of Orders in Council, because I have known some of them not to be published until three and four months after they had been passed. For these reasons I protest for the hundredth time-even at the risk of being considered a bore, because while I sit'here I will not allow one of the prerogatives that belong to Parliament to be invaded without registering an objection-at the course which has been followed. I claim that under the War Measures Act power could not be derived on the 3rd of December to pass an Order in Council such as the one that has been passed in this case. The only word in that Act which would justify it-and I will read the clause from the Act for the information of the Committee-is the word ''welfare."" That word was not intended to be coupled with such a scheme as the present I do not use the word in any offensive sense, and perhaps it would be better to say ""plan."" Now section 6 of the Act reads as follows:
The Governor in Council shall have power to do and authorize such acts and things, and to make from time to time such orders and regulations as he may, (by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion, or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.
I consider that the word ""welfare"" is the only one in the statute which would give them authority to pass such Orders in Council as we are now considering. Under those circumstances, I desire to register my most emphatic protest against it.

ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"Is it intended to restrict the provinces 'to that rate of interest, or to give them: liberty of action to charge more if they so desire?
Mr. ROWELlL:	We have not imposed
any restriction on the Provincial Govern- [DOT] ments, but I understand they are loaning at that rate. We all recognize that the cost of building at the present time is greater than it was before the war, and it is greater now than we hope it will be when vye get back to anything like normal conditions. Therefore the man who builds a house at the present time is called upon to put more money into it than the property may be worth in four or five years when values come back to something more approaching normal. Consequently, if the State is to encourage the building of houses at this time it is necessary that it should make some contribution. When it has arranged for- repayment of the loan over a period of twenty years and fixed the interest at 5 per cent, it seems to me, the Government has rendered substantial assistance.
The other clause to which I desire to draw particular attention is No. 7:
7. Advances may be made as soon as a general scheme of housing shall have been agreed upon between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Province applying for a loan hereunder.
The Government had in view not only assisting the provision of houses, but the importance of insuring that those houses would be of a certain standard as to size or rooms,	air space, size of	the
site, and sanitary conditions.	In
short, they had in view the direct object of improving the housing conditions, particularly in our larger cities. Therefore they stipulated that before any money could be advanced a housing scheme must

be agreed upon between the Provincial and Federal Governments.
In order to work out the provisions of that Order in Council, that is, to take up with the Provincial Governments and endeavour to agree with them upon housing schemes, a further Order in Council was passed on the 12th of December, 1918. Hon. members will find it in the pamphlet already distributed. By the way, this Order also was made on the recommendation of the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White). It says:
The Minister observes that in view of the national importance of adequate and suitable housing accommodation, which affects vitally the health, morals, and general well-being of the entire community, it is desirable that the financial assistance thus provi'died should be utilized at the earliest possible date in the provision of the housing accommodation contemplated by the said Order in Council.
The Minister further observes that it is therefore desirable that a Committee of the Cabinet should be appointed to be known as the Housing Committee, which shall be authorized to take up without delay with the several Provinces of Canada the question of their need for additional housing accommodation and the housing programme they have in view in order to secure -an early agreement with the said provinces under which the said moneys .may be utilized for housing purposes.
The Minister therefore recommends:-
1.	That there be constituted a. Committee of the Privy Council known as the Housing Committee, consisting of the following members :

Hon. Mr. Rowell, President of the Privy Council;
Hon. Mr. Robertson, Minister of Labour;
Hon. Mr. Maclean, Vice-President of the Reconstruction and Development Committee of Canada;
Hun. Mr. urerar, Minister of Agriculture.
The Honourable Mr. Rowell is to be Chairman of the Committee.
2.	That this Committee formulate the general principles which should be followed in any housing schemes in order to secure the results aimed at by the said Order in Council.
That the Committee communicate with the Governments of the several Provinces of Canada in reference to the matters above mentioned with a view to agreeing with the Governments of the said Provinces, respectively, upon any such general schemes of housing, so that the moneys provided by the said Order in Council of December 3, 191S, may be applied for the purposes contemplated by the said Order.
4. That the Committee be authorized and empowered to do and perform all such further acts as may be necessary in order to carry out and give full effect to the said Order in Council of December 3, 1918.
The Minister further recommends that the said1 Committee be authorized to secure the assistance and co-operation of Mr. Thomas Adams, the Town Planning Expert of the Commission of Conservation, and of any other person or persons specially qualified to advise r+ assist the said Committee in carrying on its work.
Pursuant to that Order in Council, the Committee did take up the question of the
principles to be embodied in the housing schemes which the Federal Government might be asked to approve. Drafts of those principles were furnished to all the Provincial Governments, and received consideration at the hands of those Governments. Some modifications were suggested, but on the whole the principles as laid down and submitted by the Committee were accepted. An Order in Council was then passed setting out those principles. The members of the Committee will find this third Order in Council at page 9 of the pamphlet. The important clause of this Order is No. 2:
The Housing Committee observe that they have submitted the general principles to the Governments of all the provinces, and requested suggestions from the said Governments, with reference thereto, and after duly considering all such suggestions, the Committee submit the following statement and report, and recommend the approval thereof by Your Excellency in Council, and further recommend that upon approval, copies of said memorandum be furnished the Governments of the said Provinces of Canada.
Now, what are these principles which underlie the Government's housing policy and which must be embodied in the policies of the different Provincial Governments? You will find a statement of the object the Government has in view at the top of page 10:
(1)	General object in view.-The object of
the Government 'iln making provision for a loan of $2'5,00'0,0'00 at 5 per cent to the Provincial Governments for housing purposes is-
(a)	to promote the erection of dwelling houses of	character tc .relieve Cvugesliou of
population in cities and towns; (b) to put within the reach of all working men, particularly returned soldiers, the opportunity of acquiring theiir own homes at actual cost of the building and land acquired at a fair value, thus eliminating the profits of the speculator; (c) to contribute to the general health and wellbeing of the community by encouraging suitable town planning and housing schemes.
(2)	Promotion of Housing Schemes matter
for Provincial and Municipal Jurisdiction.-The provision of houses, so far as it may be regarded as a public duty, is a matter which comes more properly within the jurisdiction of the provinces and municipalities, and in ordinary circumstances, the question of what regulations should be imposed, and what policy should be adopted, in regard to the administration of housing schemes, are matters for these Governments. As the Federal Government will lend the money on the general security of each province, it is not necessary to impose financial regulations as to the means which should be employed to safeguard the loans.	\
Conditions on which Loans will be Granted by the Federal Government.
Having regard however, to the responsibility incurred by the Federal Government in providing the money, and to the object for which the money is proposed to be lent, loans will be

made to the Provincial Governments on the following four conditions :-
1.	Approval of General Provisions.-Each province shall prepare and submit to the Federal Government for approval, a general housing scheme; setting out the standards and conditions to be complied with in connection with local housing schemes. The general scheme of each province should include a schedule of minimum standards in regard to grouping of houses, provision of open spaces, sizes and heights of houses, sizes and heights of rooms, provision of light and ventilation, heating, lighting, character of materials, etc., which it is proposed should be enforced as the minimum requirements for health, comfort and convenience.
Eacli province, before it can obtain a loan from the Federal Government, must submit its housing scheme, setting out the particulars with regard to the administration of its own housing proposals.
The second condition is in regard to the maximum cost of dwellings. As the object of the Federal Government was to ensure that workingmen particularly returned soldiers and men of limited means, should have the full advantage of this loan, the Government decided that no money loaned by it should be used for the building of large houses for people who could well afford to build their own houses. The Government, therefore, imposed these restrictions as to the amount that could be loaned on any house:-
2.	Maximum cost of dwellings, etc..-The object of the Federal Government being to facilitate the erection of dwellings at a moderate cost suitable for working men, particularly returned soldiers, it is necessary to place a maximum on the amount which may be loaned per dwelling, and the following maximum has been fixed having regard to the conditions existing in the different Provinces.
(a)	Detached or semi-detached dwellings with walls constructed wholly or partly of frame, stucco on f ame, brick veneer, inclusive of the capital value of the site and necessary local improvements:-
With 4 or 5 rooms exclusive of bathroom and summer kitchen, $3,000.
Having regard to the present cost of building, it was considered that that was a fair amount for a house of that size and character:-
With 6 or 7 rooms exclusive of bathroom and summer kitchen, $3,500.
(b)	Detached, semi-detached1, groups of three or more or duplex (cottage flat) dwellings with walls of brick, hollow-tile, stone or concrete and roofing of fire-proof materials, inclusive of the capital value of the site and necessary local improvements:-
With 4 or 5 rooms exclusive of bathroom and summer kitchen, $4,000.
With 6 or 7 rooms exclusive of bathroom and summer kitchen, $4,500.

I generally deal more in principles than in details, but we may leave it at, say, 40,000 people, approximately. It would be well for us to reflect that if the houses were up to-morrow, that is all that we should be doing for the people under this scheme; and to get that done we will have to get started and get the Provincial Governments into line quickly. I do not oppose the measure on principle, but I would like to see something bigger and better from the Government pretty soon; and a lot of the folks in the country, in Winnipeg, for instance, feel the same way.

The money might be spent in the heart of the city in unoccupied areas available for buildings, just as it might be spent in suburban areas. With reference to the case mentioned by my hon. friend, that is a question with which the province would deal absolutely. Under the Ontario system, where local improvements are provided, a certain percentage of the cost is assumed by the municipality and a certain percentage charged to the lots, and
I presume that law would apply to any' sections laid out under these proposals.-

As I say, that is the way the Government acts; it is the manner in which the decision of the Government is given on matters of routine and on matters of policy. In the same way a municipality acts by bylaw or resolution; the Cabinet acts by Order in Council or by Minute of Council approved by the Cabinet. Now, what is the record? In 1908, 4,832 Orders in Council were passed.

We impose no limit on the provinces, but the provinces themselves in
a good many eases do impose some limit. Ontario, for instance, loans 85 per cent of the total cost of the land and the house. This whole scheme is designed just for the purpose of aiding the working man of limited means.

$60,000,000 on the last night. We have spent a good deal of time this week discussing various matters which if they had been discussed at this hour of !he night would have had a very small audience, even of Government supporters. We have only been informed of what this vote actually means this evening, and I think it is only fair that the minister should accede to the wishes of the leader of the Opposition and the Opposition generally, and I think also of many of his supporters. A large vote like this requires careful consideration. We have got into the habit of talking of tens and hundreds of millions of dollars, but the day is coming when we shall have to meet the interest on our investments and repay our loans. I think it would probably be the means of facilitating legislation in the future, as well as right now, if the minister would report progress.

He seems to think that it is right and proper to grant to a large corporation engaged in developing coal mines the ex-propriatory powers necessary to that development, but entirely wrong to grant them to an individual, say, or a small corporation-, desiring to utilize a water power. In my judgment, one is exactly on the same ground as the other. I am finding no fault with the Nova Scotia legislation, although I hope that legislation does not vest the power absolutely in the coal mine owners, but maintains governmental control. If it does, then it seems to me it is justified, and this legislation rests on the very same, if not, indeed, on a higher ground. The hon. member for Three Rivers (Mr. Bureau) says that in the case of a public utility the expropriatory power is all right; but that with respect to a private property the expropriatory power, even although govern-mentally controlled, is all wrong.

whole of the discussion on this Bill, but I very largely agree with the hon. member for Three Rivers (Mr. Bureau) and the hon. member for South Cape Breton (Mr. Butts) that it is rather too great a power to grant any private individual the right to expropriate his neighbour's property. This Bill particularly deals with Government-owned water-powers, and we cannot criticise the Government in laying down rules as to property of which it is the owner. But right alongside of that Government property there may be privately-owned property which the owner himself may need for the development of the waterpower which it contains. But suppose a man who is better off than the owner, and is prepared to go on with the development at once, buys the adjacent water-power from the Government. Under this Bill he could obtain authority from the Government to take his neighbour's land and possibly for all time to deprive that neighbour of the opportunity to develop the water-power on his own land or to utilize the property for a thousand and one other reasons for which he may require it. It is quite possible for the wealthier individual to step in and under the provisions contained in the Railway Act take his neighbour's land. I think that he should be left to deal with his neighbour just as would be the case if a person wanted to build a store on his own property and required some adjoining land for the purpose of keeping a cattle yard, or for some other reason in connection with the running of his store. In such a case as that the man contemplating the purchase must deal with his neighbour and buy the land in the ordinary way. Nobody would think of giving a man who wished to build a warehouse the right /to go and expropriate his neighbour's land. He would be told at once' ""Make your bargain in the ordinary way, and if you cannot get the property you will

have to go without. The fact of your wanting to establish a stock-yard in connection with your business does not affect the public, and therefore jve cannot pass over to you the power of expropriation.'' I cannot see very much difference between that case and the case of a man who buys a piece of property on which there is a waterfall or a creek that is strong enough to furnish hydraulic energy. I don't see why such a man should have the right to compel his neighbour to yield his property to him if he does not want to do so. I have not heard the minister advance very much argument on the point, and I would like to be convinced that there is any real necessity for any such right to be vested in a private individual. If it was a corporation that had to develop a certain amount of horse-power before their proposition would be considered by the Government at all-a corporation, for example, that were prepared to go on and develop power for the general benefit of the country, or for the benefit of a town or local industries, or something of that nature-I could understand it. As I read the section, however, it gives the right to any individual who wishes to build a sawmill, a grist-mill, or anything of the like, for which he requires water-power entirely for the benefit of himself, 1o take his neighbour's land and use it for such private purpose. I cannot agree with any such proposition.
My hon. friend from South Cape Breton (Mr. Butts) has referred to the powers given to the Dominion Coal Company. Those people operate a very large coal mine under the provisions of the Coal Mines Act of Nova Scotia which permits any lands required for mining purposes to be expropriated. Well, to operate a ""coal mine you must have miners and you must have houses for the miners, and you can very easily persuade the Minister of Mines, of the province that if you need to build houses for the accommodation of your miners you should get the necessary land. It was for such purposes as that, expro-priatory powers were given to the Dominion Coal Company. Now, the running of coal mines, or like operations, is in the public interest, and everything should be done to encourage the enterprise and help it along. But that is entirely different from undertakings of a purely private character, and for the reasons I have given I think the minister should not be too ready to grant rights of the kind to a private individual.

ROWELL AS TO POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.,,"Well,we may split the difference and say around 40,000. The Rouses are noit all up now, and I do not know whether the minister can give us any idea how long it will take before the provincial governments will have come into agreement *with the Dominion Government and started the operations at all. So that, after all, it is not possible to represent this scheme as *one of hurricane relief to any housing conditions needed ! to make returned soldiers [DOT]comfortable. I very much fear that the scheme partakes of the nature of a pill to cure an earthquake, if there is any housing condition of a serious character to relieve. I sympathize very much with .the last .remark that fell from the lips of. the hon. member for Chateauguay-Huntingdon (Mr. Robb). What I think the country is looking to this Government for, and what it will look for to any government that may rule the destinies of this nation in the immediate future, is something in the way of fundamental reform. Now this kind of social welfare relief-I desire to make myself clear-will be better the sooner it takes effect, and I repeat that this thing seems small. It seems likely to be tardy, and I do trust the Government will try to couple with this, which no one wants to oppose, something very much more substantial when the Budget comes down. I have an idea, Sir, after seventeen years in this country which I began by putting up a shack of some kind in six weeks that did not cost very much and was built without help by way of loan from any government,

I have an idea that if this country were properly governed, and its wealth properly distributed, as far as it can be distributed, by wise acts of governments, every man with much in him would soon get his own house. The reason he does not do so is that there is too much wealth in the hands
of few and too little in the hands of many, and it is possible for the Government to take steps, through proper fiscal arrangements, to alter this -state of affairs. As I said, I do not want to offer any flat opposition to this or any other measure of the kind that seems to offer a chance of some kind of relief to the conditions that are unfavourable amongst our population. The fact of the matter is that we have too much paternalism in a-country like Canada, where you have a continent of resources and only eight millions of people. There is a tendency in the Government to imitate,
I think, whatever they see being done in other countries under post-war conditions. The minister has been in England and I am perfectly sure he has given a great deal of sincere study to the conditions there; but I -want to put it to him that in the British Islands there are forty-five millions of people living on what are practically two pin points compared to the immense area of natural wealth we have here; and measures that are suitable for the relief of conditions which have grown up during centuries in England may be entirely unsuited to us in Canada. We may want to go back in the history of the world to find out what Britain -was doing for her population seventy years ago when she destroyed tariffs and repealed the corn laws. It might be better if we got our inspiration from that period. I throw that out as a suggestion that should be helpful to the Government, and hope they will communicate it to the Minister of Finance. And I want to tell the President of the Council (Mr. Rowell) that if he would take that prescription he would find that it was not a pill to cure an earthquake but that it would operate almost immediately in giving the people social welfare, neither in clauses nor in preambles, nor in health bills, nor even in a tardy and small housing scheme, but social welfare in their stomachs and upon their shoulders and on their -feet. For that is where the people want primarily to feel social welfare. They want it at once, and I agree with my hon. friend from Chateauguay-Huntingdon that they ought to get much through proper fiscal arrangements. I hope I shall not be taken as being very truculent in my criticism of this scheme.	The figures I
have given, are, I am sure, correct when they are brought up to date by my hon. friend from Brome.

I would like to know the minister's views in regard to settling immigrants on land more than fifteen miles from a railway. Are immigrants permitted to settle on any Canadian Government land regardless of distances from railways? The minister would hardly suggest that the strike in Winnipeg is an inducement to labourers to come to Canada, nor would it be contended that the high prices of lands adjacent to railways in Western Canada and held by speculators is in the nature of an inducement. If this department is not in a position to do immigration or colonization work we should re-name it, and vote sufficient to provide for the policing of the boundary, as the minister has pointed out.

In addition to bringing people to the country, there has been cast upon the department the duty of closely scrutinizing those who nave been passing backwards and forwards between Canada and the United States. In that regard at least the department has never heretofore had as much work to do. The increase in the expenditure is necessary for that reason. As to immigration generally, I think there is very little chance of our getting many people from Europe in the near future. Shipping conditions are such now and will so continue for some time that we cannot look to receiving any great number of immigrants from Great Britain or from the continent of Europe. On the other hand, we are continuing to receive a very large number of people from the United States, which last year amounted to somewhere in the neighbourhood of 60,000. The year before that, the number was about 75,000, and I would not be at all surprised if this year we will have approximately from 75,000 to
100,000	residents of the United States entering Canada for settlement here. It is very difficult at the present time to anticipate what the condition is going to be in regard to immigration from Europe. I am inclined to the view that as soon as conditions become a little more settled we may look for a very large immigration from Great Britain, and possibly from the Northern European countries. As to that, however, one can only guess, because of the present unsettled conditions in those countries. I think we may look forward to a continuing immigration from the United States when we consider that country has now a population somewhere in the neighbourhood of 115,000,000, that the natural increase of population there is very large, and the amount of land available for settlement purposes is very greatly restricted. I think the natural growth of the population of the United States, in addition to the number they receive from outside countries, will have a tendency, for some years to come, to cause a very large number to migrate to Canada. So long as there is available in Canada large areas of arable land suitable for settlement I think we may expect that movement to grow.

Mr. iCALDER: It was provided last year that only returned soldiers should settle on Crown lands lying within a distance of fifteen miles from the railways. Outside of that, homesteading is still being carried on, principally in Northern Saskatchewan and Alberta. As to Eastern Canada, we are still carrying on publicity work as through our agencies in the United States. I understand that a number of people have been induced to come from New England and settle in Northern Quebec during the last six months or so. Our agencies in the Eastern part of United States have been securing very good results in the way of inducing persons to migrate to Canada and settle on lands.

As to the Hutterites, probably one thousand entered Canada; that would be the limit. I have seen no statement in the press to the effect that 25,000 or 30,000 of these people have entered Canada. I am absolutely sure that that statement is very greatly exaggerated.

whatever for any class of Mennonites who object to sending their children to the ordinary public schools, and I am rather surprised to learn that Mennonites in Western Canada raise that objection. I would not be at all surprised to learn that all Mennonites do not so object, because Mennonites who now live in Alberta came originally from Waterloo county, and in Waterloo county Mennonites make absolutely no objection to sending their children to the ordinary schools; I do not think the thought ever entered their minds to have separate schools for themselves. They speak a language of their own only amongst themselves, it being known sometimes as Pennsylvania Dutch, a combination of English and German. These people have lived in that county for a hundred years, and they have never raised any objection to their children going to public schools. Is the chief cause for desiring to exclude the Mennonites from Western Canada the fact that they are not inclined to permit their children to attend the public schools, or is it because of their objection to compulsory military service? They are moral, industrious, honest and make very desirable citizens, as I am sure any hon. member who ever came into contact with the Mennonites as we have them in Western Ontario and saw their farms and the result of their work and intelligence, will admit, although he might find fault with them for objecting to compulsory military service. As the minister states, there are Mennonites and Mennonites. Of the old Mennonites, there is an off-shoot called the New Mennonites who have somewhat different religious beliefs, and to my personal knowledge many of the new Mennonites volunteered for military service in this war. I have not with me a letter that I received the other day, shortly after the previous debate we had on the Mennonite question, but it was written by a man well known to me and he made this statement, which I have no reason to disbelieve, that in Toronto a certain Mennonite congregation sent to the front more men voluntarily than any other congregation in that ultra-loyal city. That must have been from the branch known as the New Mennonites, and there is amongst those who are now settled in Ontario a tendency to become more assimilated with the general population, that being especially the case when they go into the towns and cities. I should like it to be understood that if the Mennonites in Western Canada
object to sending their children to the public schools, there is a distinction between them and those living in Western Ontario.

gentleman to old settled regions in Western Canada where good agricultural land can be purchased at from $15 to $20 an acre. In the southwestern portion of Saskatchewan lands are held as high as $30, $35, $40, $45, $50, and even $60 an acre, but in Western Canada a great deal of land can still be purchased at from $15 to $20 an acre. That, however, is not the point. In dealing with the question of land settlement and colonization, we are bound to consider the fact that conditions vary greatly in all the provinces, and a policy that would be practicable for the Prairie Provinces might not apply to British Columbia or to New Brunswick. The problem is, after all, very largely a local one. The Dominion Government owns land only in the three Prairie Provinces; it does not own Crown land in the other provinces of Canada; and while the Federal Government should establish the machinery and the agencies whereby we may induce people to come to Canada, and while the nation as a whole has a very large interest in this problem, we must not overlook the fact that every provincial government that owns its own Crown land, outside of the Prairie Provinces, has a very large interest in this problem. It was for that reason that last fall we had a conference with the provincial premiers at Ottawa to discuss the matter thoroughly, and we decided upon the fullest co-operation with them. In a comparatively short time now, when the present abnormal conditions cease, I have not the slightest doubt that all the provinces in Canada will be quite willing to co-operate with the Federal Government so as to secure the greatest possible results in this field of endeavour. I am satisfied that with that co-operation, with a wise expenditure of money, we shall be able to secure large results in the way of immigration into this country and in the settlement of our vacant lands.

minister that we should have a very much larger population; but we have been getting immigration into this country for the last forty years, and I should like the minister to tell me, if he can-and I believe he could if he wanted to-the reason why we have not increased our population more rapidly, having regard to the number of immigrants we have secured and to the natural increase in our population. In the last forty years, we have lost upwards of 8,000,000 of our
1644	'	. 1
population by emigration. During that period we received over 5,000,000 immigrants, and that immigration, along with the natural increase in population, should have given us a population of at least 16,000,000 people to-day, but we have only about
8,000,000. Apparently our immigrants were coming in at one door and going out at another; we were simply a station on the way to the United States. If we kept our immigrants in Canada, the Canadian born people went to the United States. The minister has in mind increasing immigration, and that is a very good policy, but before he can hope to make a success of immigration and colonization, he must find out why people who come to Canada from foreign countries do not remain in this country. At the present time, there are over 1,000,000 Canadian born citizens in the United States, [DOT]and they have been going out of Canada every year for many years. The only time-that we held our immigration to any extent, was between 1900 and about 1912, during which period we made some progress, but previous to that time we were losing not only a number equivalent to our immigration, but a large portion of our natural increase. After 1900, we began to retain some of our immigration and some of the natural increase, so that in one census period our population increased by over 1,500,000. It is questionable, however, whether we have increased in the last ten years. The minister is asking for an increased appropriation to spend on immigration, and he must have in mind that when he gets an immigrant here he is to keep him. How does he purpose doing better in the future than we have been doing in the past with practically the same fiscal arrangement, the same form of Government and the same internal conditions generally?
What leads the minister to believe that people are going to stay here in future instead of going to some other country, as they have been doing in the past? What greater inducements have we to keep them here now?

Consequently, when I am asked about the ownership of land in Nova Scotia, I answer we have no land.

Yet, the minister tells me I do not know what I am talking about, and that I do not know the state of things in my own province. That is no answer; it is a mere subterfuge.

If the Government will announce that their immigration policy has been changed and that it will now embrace the whole of Canada, that is another matter. But we have never heard that the policy of the Gov-

eminent with regard to immigration has been changed. I do not think that there is any authority in the minister's department to take the moneys voted by this House and spend them in any province in which the Government of Canada, as such, owns land. My theory is that these moneys are voted for the purpose of dealing with lands owned by the Canadian people through the right of this Parliament. No one realizes more than I do the great necessity of developing an immigration policy in Nova Scotia. In that province much splendid agricultural land is inviting cultivation. The difficulty is that there are industries to which the people go more readily than they go on the farms. They like to work in the coal mines, steel works, factories, and so on; they are not so willing to stay on the land. If the minister can do anything to make agriculture more interesting to immigrants or to the people who now live in Nova Sootia than it is at present, no one will more heartily give him the honour that is due him than I Vill. I trust that if it is the policy of the Government to extend their immigration policy they will have the greatest possible success in my own native province as well as in every other old province to which they may extend their energies.

It is pretty hard to keep a Cape Bretoner or a Nova Scotian at work on the farm; he finds it more congenial to take up other work. But farming may be made more attractive to these people, along the lines suggested by the minister.

Last year we paid our officials, placed at many points along the international boundary from coast to coast, $183,164. Salaries paid in the United States amounted to $82,013, and in Great Britain $67,072. In the United States we now have 22 offices which have been in operation for a number of years. These offices are at Detroit, Saginaw, St. Paul, Grand Forks, Watertown, Spokane, Syracuse, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Omaha, Columbus, Harrisburg, Des Moines, Biddeford, Great Falls, Boston, Bedford, New York, Portland, Manchester, N.H., Chicago and San Francisco. At each of these points we have a chief agent. There are twenty stenographers and six other clerks. The staff in these 22 offices number in all 48, and the salaries amounted to approximately $82,000. Last year we closed three offices in the United States, one of those three being in Michigan, one in Philadelphia, because we felt there was really no necessity for their continuance. As regards the result of the work in the United States, I said this afternoon that the number of immigrants that arrived last year in Canada was about 60,000, and in the previous year about 75,000. (In Great Britain we have twelve offices, eight in England, two in Scotland, and two in Ireland. On the continent all offices were closed shortly after the war. We had an officer in Antwerp and a staff in France. Our agent in France died some months ago, and no appointment has yet been made. The work in England during the last year or two has been confined very largely to repatriation in one form or another. During the past six months our staff has been extremely busy in connection with the re-

turn of soldiers' wives and children to Canada, and the staff at London has had to be increased in order to take care of that work. Our staff in the outside offices have also had considerable work. The dependents of our soldiers are pretty well scattered over the United Kingdom and there is a good deal of work involved in arranging for transportation and so on. The total expenditure in the department last year for salaries was $544,000. We are now asking for an expenditure of $575,000. L cannot say at present what provision will be made by the 'Civil Service Commission in connection with the reorganization of our Outside Service. I do not know what schedules will be brought down. Our outside staffs will be re-organized and classified salaries will be provided, and I would anticipate that in the new arrangement some increases in salaries will have to be provided. During the year I have had to provide for a number of increases in salary. In our Outside Service there was no provision for the ordinary annual increase that the Inside civil servants receive, and when I came to look into the matter 1 found a great many anomalies that had to be adjusted in fairness to a number of first-class officials who had been in the department a good many years. We may as well be frank about the matter; we all know that in the past the Outside Service was to a large extent treated from a purely political standpoint by all Governments, and in the result many men in the service were not treated on an equitable basis. When I began to ascertain what was right and proper in these cases, I found it necessary to make many re-adjustments, and as a result our whole service outside has been very much improved. I think there is a better spirit, and I am confident that we are getting to-day in our immigration service in 'Canada, the United States and Great 'Britain far better work than has been secured for many years, simply because .these little matters which had been neglected for a considerable time were attended to.

(Mr. Lemieux). As a matter of fact, for many years we have had an agent at Antwerp and we have obtained many very desirable settlers from Belgium. According to my latest information-and I have made official inquiries- the Belgian Government will not, in the very near future, look with very much favour upon any effort made to induce its people to leave their own country. I am sure hon. members can quite understand the reason for that, because Belgium has also lost a large portion of its population, and conditions in that country, as a result of the war, are far from being what they should be and the Belgian Government are anxious that the country should be rehabilitated and put on a sound
basis agriculturally and industrially as quickly as possible. iSo far as all that class of immigration work is concerned, that is, as regards Belgium, France, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, all those countries in northern Europe, all that we can do at the present time, because shipping under any circumstances will not be available until after September or probably after even October, is to have a very careful review made of the situation. Some person must visit those countries and get in actual touch with the situation so that we may have first hand knowledge. When that is done, we shall have the facts and we shall know what action can be taken, tout until that review' is made I doubt very much if any action could be taken. Until our soldiers and their dependents are home-and that will take some months yet -there will be no shipping available for such immigration.

He began with $200 and, after the lapse of twenty years, it amounted to $600 or $700. He was appointed originally in connection with guarding the forest but afterwards became a customs officer, and for twenty years served this Government as faithfully as any man ever served his Maker. In addition to being a customs officer he performed duties for the Immigration Department at $100 a year. About the 3rd of last October he received notice from the Government that he was dismissed, and his dismissal took effect at the end of the previous month, so that he was removed before he got notice. I took the matter up with the Customs Department, and they wrote me a very curt note that the offices had been combined for economy's sake. Now we discover that his successor is receiving $600 or $700 a year as customs officer, and is paid an additional $600 a year by the Department of Immigration, whereas the man who served his country faithfully for twenty years at a salary of $600 or $700 a year was dismissed for economy's sake. I am free to state that I do not think the minister knew anything about this little job, or the Minister of Customs either; I think it is a little bit of trickery on the part of some official. Mr. Conner held the position for twenty years; raised a family of ten children in this country; farmed anywhere from four to five or six quarter-sections; bore the burden and heat of the day during all these long years; did his duty for his country and was proud of it; guarded the boundary just as faithfully 'as if he owned the country; and during the long term he held the office turned in every dollar of revenue he could collect for the Government. Yet he is dismissed and that dismissal took effect two or three days before he received the notice. The statement made to him, and also to me, was that it was done for the purpose of economy. Now we find when the showdown comes in Parliament that the salary for the new appointee has been pretty nearly doubled, and James Conner, a faithful servant, is turned adrift. I do not blame the minister, because I do not think he really knew what had happened; but if this kind of thing has occurred in many other cases it is no wonder there is great discontent among civil servants. I appeal to my hon. friend the member for Lisgar (Mr. Bolton), in which constituency Mr. Conner lives, to bear out my statement. The hon. gentleman knows him as intimately as I do, and

said to me that a more decent man did not live in the province of Manitoba. I think it is the most shameful treatment I ever knew to be meted out to iany official in this country.

According to the Estimates there is an increase of $25,000, so that there is a difference of practically $120,000 of increases to employees in Canada. What percentage of increase would that be? How many employees are there?
Mr. CA'LDER: I have not been quite able to follow the hon. gentleman. It is true that we have made a net reduction at the rate of $98,000; that is, if these people had all been retired at the first of' the year, there would have been a saving in annual salaries of $98,000, but these changes took place at varying times of the year, so that there has not been that net saving. On the other hand, as I have already explained, we have found it necessary to adjust salaries in our outside service in Canada, and while any increases, have been for comparatively small amounts, they make a large aggregate. These adjustments would have had to be made anyway, and when the salary schedules are brought down by the Civil Service Commission still further increases in salaries will have to be made if we are to retain these men in the service. We cannot expect to carry on these services at tne same rate of salaries as were paid prior *to 1914, and consequently we must look for increases of this kind.

tion should be' paid to bringing immigrants from Great Britain than from the United States. The policy enunciated by the minister this afternoon would almost lead one to believe that the old policy is still going to be followed of paying more attention to Western Canada than to the older provinces. I have always advocated that it is not in the interest of Canada to have immigration controlled by the Department of the Interior. I should like to know if anything is going to be done towards supplying men for labour, particularly for the farms, in the old provinces. I would make special reference to Ontario, because there is no question that at present there is altogether too much land under cultivation in that province in view of the number of people who are there to take care of it.

In other words, we must arrange now for the necessary publicity and propaganda work to be carried on to secure results some time hence. That work costs money. During the war our expenditure in Great Britain for advertising and publicity was cut down to practically nothing, for reasons which must be apparent. We have carried a certain small expenditure, but that has not affected the situation. To get results, you must plan ahead. As a matter of fact, probably the most effective work that is being done in Great Britain is the work we do among the school children. Practically every person who is interested in the immigration movement realizes that. The seed sown in the mind of the child at school will bear fruit when he comes of age. That class of work costs money, and we shall have to expend money in Great Britain in a fairly large way, and begin right now, because we are a little behind time, if we want to get results either next year or the year following.
I am very doubtful whether iwe shall secure much farm labour from Great Britain. Only some fifteen per cent of the population of Great Britain is engaged in agriculture, and every effort is being made by the State to keep every possible man on the land and get others to go on it. It seems to me, therefore, we shall have great difficulty in getting farm labour from Great Britain. I can assure the hon. gentleman, however, that every effort will be

made in that direction, because I thoroughly understand the need of that class of labour in Canada. I also thoroughly agree with my hon. friend that a large percentage of those people, if they can be induced to do so, should be encouraged to settle in the older provinces of Canada. Our policy shall not be sectional; it should be nationwide. In co-operation with the provinces we should endeavour to work out some plan whereby any immigration coming will be distributed as evenly as- possible throughout the whole of Canada.
Mr. RICHARDSON; I was told to-day that there was a demand for 5,000 farm labourers in Canada, but that there was great difficulty in getting men for the work. Should not that situation be taken care of by the returned soldier? Does he indicate any disposition to take up that kind of work?
Mr. ClALDER:	I do not know exactly
what the situation is in regard to farm labour, but I am told that in Western Canada it has very much improved, and that there is not the dearth there was a month ago. I understand the problem is being very well taken care of, but just where the labour is coming from, I do not know. 'Some time ago it was thought it would be necessary to import farm labour from the United States, but the situation has changed, and recently we have not had any request from the Western Provinces for a move in that direction.

regard to the prospect of immigration. The hon. minister says, not in the immediate future, but in a year or two or three from now. The expenditure has been made in Great Britain already. We have had an army overseas for the last four years that has been carrying on propaganda work there which is bound to have its effect in the immediate future. The majority of the men our soldiers have come in contact with over there in the army, so far as I can learn, have signified their desire and intention to come out to Canada if they can possibly arrange to do so. I do not think it is necessary to launch propaganda in the schools or anything of that kind. I -think the Department of Immigration will find that during the next few years, indeed, right in the immediate future, their efforts will be taxed to the utmost to take care of the people who desire to come to this country from Great Britain, notwithstanding all the efforts that may be made to retain them over there. There is a condition
1654	'
of affairs existing in the old world at the present time the effects of which no one can at present accurately determine. The condition of affairs in this country to-day is such that I can well understand the reluctance of the Government to take a stand that would aggravate it in any way. But we should not close our eyes to the situation; it is one that will have to be met. Canada is suffering as no other country in the world has ever suffered, for people to till its soil. Under the conditions that exist to-day it is absolutely impossible to keep farm help on the farm; they have been going into the towns and cities faster during the last few months than at any time in the past, notwithstanding the crying demand for men to till the soil. This is an artificial condition of affairs. You are eliminating competition in many walks of life in the industrial centres. Not only are you to-day threatening to limit or curtail competition in the rural districts, but you are being asked to enact legislation that will discourage production of foodstuffs. The demand is being made here in Ottawa, and in all the cities throughout Canada, that agricultural products should not be permitted to be exported from this country.
I could not help reflecting upon the statement made by the leader of the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie) this afternoon that only about ten per cent of the food consumed in the province of Nova Scotia was raised in that province. We are practically reaching that condition of affairs in the older provinces generally, and if this condition continues Canada will soon be an importing, instead of an exporting, country for many essential and important food products.
I have some figures here for 1911 which show that a very serious condition obtained at that time-and do not forget that the immigrants that come to Canada do not by any means all remain here. The report of the High Commissioner for Canada shows that in 1907 151,216 British subjects came to Canada, and 33,691 returned to Great Britain. In 1908, 81,321 came to Canada, and 39,866 returned, or almost fifty per cent. That was the condition of affairs which existed for many years. We have been boasting about the tremendous immigration to this country but it has been to a large extent only transitory, from one-third to one-half going back again. Since the war we have been at a standstill in this matter, and our agricultural industries have not only been stagnant but have been going back. It may be that we have increased production, but the agricultural conditions of the land, particularly in the

oia provinces, is most regrettable. The bad farming that has been carried on through these years in order to produce as much as was possible is to-day showing its effects, and the results in the future are bound to be worse than at present. If this condition continues and the price of labour in the cities and towns still goes up the cost of living will not be reduced but will go higher. No other result is possible from the conditions that prevail in Canada and elsewhere. I appreciate the difficulties with which the minister is confronted. Possibly he may have some well defined policy in mind which it might not be in the public interest to announce at this time, we may as well face the issue as it is. We have either to lose our present standing as an agricultural people, or we must put forth great efforts to the end that the people in Great Britain who intend to come *here shall be enabled to do so even if assistance must be given. That may not be a popular thing to say in the towns and cities, but it is a fact which will have to be faced. I am glad that the Immigration Department will be under the control of a minister who will devote his entire time and attention to this great and difficult question which will confront Canada from now on.

the only thing you can do with a prophet is to disbelieve him, and I must say that I do not anticipate the flood of British immigrants to this country that my hon. friend from South Oxford (Mr. Sutherland) expects. I do not know what conditions in Britain he refers to that are going to induce that flood. I was speaking to a commercial gentleman from Manchester a few days ago and he told me that it was tolerably well understood that in Britain they have already re-absorbed into civil occupation eighty per cent of returned soldiers. As an illustration of how that re-absorption is taking place, it might interest the Committee, who may not have noticed the figures, to know that in the month of January the shipping tonnage turned out on the Clyde was 15,000; in February it was 22,000; in March, 40,000; and in April, 86,000. I have given the figures without the odd numbers, but in thousands they are correct, or my memory has undergone a more sudden failure than I had reason to suspect. Eighty-six thousand tons constituted a record for April for the Clyde with the single exception of the month of April in which the steamer Aqui-

tania was turned out. I have given the broad fact about the reabsorption of returned soldiers into civil occupation, and a local illustration of what is going on there; and on these grounds I very much doubt if my hon. friend's prophecies will be fulfilled in the immediate future. It would be difficult for him to find an inducement for these people to come from the Clyde, where occupation is being taken up with such haste and avidity, to settle, let us say, in Winnipeg at the present time. I would rather stay on the Clyde, and so would my hon. friend if he were there. To my hon. friend the minister, whose patience and good nature have been the subject of my admiration since I came into this House shortly after eight o'clock, I would like to offer a suggestion, which is not of a critical kind, but is of a helpful and constructive nature, in regard to the getting of immigration from Great Britain. I want him to take advantage of his closer proximity to the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White), to impress upon that somewhat obdurate individual the need of an immediate, substantial and generous cut in the tariff against British goods. I wish he would explain to the Minister of Finance- and I wish -that hon. gentleman would give to that explanation the same wonderful concentration of mind that he shows when eating the heart out of a document or carrying on the omnivorous reading that we all know he does,-that if vessels from Great Britain were encouraged by a lower tariff to come here with British goods, there would undoubtedly come commercial travellers who would observe this country and see the magnificent opportunities it offers, and there would follow immigrants to this country. If he would only explain all that to the Minister of Finance, his Budget might send his reputation higher than it stands even at the present time, and might astonish us all. I may be mistaken, but I feel perfectly certain in my own mind that immigrants would follow the goods; that farmers would be made out of the immigrants; they would raise other goods from the soil to pay for the goods brought in, and we would have cargoes coming and cargoes going. Capital would come with both goods and immigrants, and you would build up a great trade and a useful immigration without a single agent in Britain-just by a simple method of cutting down the tariff. This could be accomplished if only we could first operate upon the mind of the Minister of Finance.

There is a range of general expenditures covering our offices in Canada, Great Britain and the United States for such items as rent, fuel, telephones, express, temporary help, and all other expenditures of that class. The heavy item in these expenditures is advertising and printing. Last year we spent $216,000 in advertising and some $34,000 in printing.
Our deportation expenditures amounted to $12,000; boundary inspections, $37,800; and general expenses $72,700. All told, our expenditures under this head last year were $501,900; we are asking this year for a vote of $775,000. Whether or not that money will be expended will depend very largely upon conditions. We may find it necessary to increase our expenditures in Great Britain. Our general expenditures there have been comparatively small. Notwithstanding what has been said by the hon. member for South Oxford (Mr. Sutherland), I am convinced that it is necessary that certain general expenditures should be carried on. While it is true that Canada has been well advertised during the period of the war, nevertheless we will find it necessary to carry on certain work there if we are to control immigration in any sense at all. Let me illustrate. It is estimated that at the present time, there is a surplus of
3,000,000 women in Great Britain. Let us take down the bars and invite these women to our shores and we will get them by the hundreds of thousands. It is very desirable, especially in the near future, that there should be a selection made, that we should not invite to this country people who are going to aggravate the situation existing at the present time. You cannot do that unless you expend money to control this immigration. While it is true
that thousands of people may desire to come to this country, we must see to it in so far as possible, that those who come are assured of employment. We simply cannot afford to have our cities flooded with people Who cannot secure employment. In speaking of the general expenditures we could very easily use $100,000 in Great Britain for carrying on very necessary work. We are also increasing our expenditures in the United States and II think probably here in Canada there is certain very useful work that might be carried on. We must consider the problem of endeavouring to get some of our people out of our cities and back on the land. If by a wise expenditure of money we can cause a movement in that direction the money will be well spent. While we are asking for an increased amount of something like $200,000, it is not the intention to expend that money unless we find there is an opportunity for expending it usefully. Last year we took a vote of $1,135,000 and I think our expenditures were in the neighbourhood of $1,000,000. We	have	under-expended the voteby	about	$130,000. It	is difficult
at this time, with conditions as they are, to forecast with any degree of certainty or accuracy what our expenditures in the field of immigration may be during the coming year. The Government must have some latitude in that respect. Conditions will likely change very considerably in the next three or four months, and we should be prepared to meet those changed conditions. If we find the situation such as to enable us to wisely expend money in that direction, the money should be available.

That does not necessarily mean advertising. There is one class of expenditure we are not going into at all now that would be most effective in carrying on immigration work, viz: through lectures and films. The suggestion has recently come to the department that in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, we should establish a service of that kind. If once established it is going to cost some money. I doubt whether we would be able to accomplish anything effective in that direction unless anywhere from $75,000 to probably $125,000 were expended. Yet, that class of advertising-because that is what it really is- would be the very best the Government could carry on. You can convey a message, or represent a scene through the moving pictures in a way that cannot be effectively done by other means. There is another class of work that has been cut off during the past few years in United States and Great Britain, and that is the use of lectures. We have not had any lectures given in the United States for some years past, nor have we had any in Great Britain, and it seems to me that if the opportunity presents itself we can very wisely spend some money in that way. The proposed increase in this vote is not entirely for advertising, although I think we will have to do some more of it. I am sure we will have to expend money on publicity work in Great Britain; but there are many other directions in which money can be spent for the purpose of carrying on very necessary immigration propaganda.

Owing to the aids to navigation by various governments for a number of years, and the depth and safety of the channel, we have had very few wrecks indeed in any part of the St. Lawrence channel. The Quebec Salvage Company are supposed to render assistance to any ships in distress from Quebec to Belle Isle and I think it would be a very unwise policy not to vote this sum. We have to keep a wrecking plant ready in case a large and expensive

passenger or freight ship should get out of the channel or run on the rocks. We could hardly say that we did not anticipate any accident, and it is no argument to say that we should not have a plant ready to help expensive ships because accidents are not frequent. With regard to the Canadian Government ship Voyageur, de did not ask the Prince Edward Island ferry to' go to her assistance because she would not have been of substantial use. Of course, she had considerable difficulty in getting from Quebec to Halifax in January but she succeeded, with the assistance that was given her by the Government ice breakers.
I hope the Committee will see the necessity for this vote. One keeps fire insurance on a building not because he is anxious for a fire but because of the necessity for protection. The same argument applies in this case.

It is an extraordinary thing that we sr.ould be paying a subsidy of $25,000 for a wrecking plant at Quebec and that when the Voyageur was in the ice for several days endeavouring to get to Halifax nobody ever thought of getting that wrecking plant to help her.

But I am sorry to say that, although we have splendid navigation and fine harbours in Eastern Nova Scotia, some times we have wrecks. We have wrecks on the west coast of Newfoundland which must be attended to from Cape Breton, the nearest point, and around the eastern side of Cape Breton on the Atlantic where steamers sometimes have the misfortune to get into difficulties. It is no consolation for the shipmaster or owner whose ship is ashore at Gabarus, for instance, in

the eastern part of Cape Breton, to know there is a wrecking plant at Quebec, because that is too far away. The Government used to give a subsidy to the Dominion Coal Company, or as it is known now, the Dominion 'Steel Company, who had, and still have, powerful tugs of their own, and also had steamers but these were commandeered during the war-I presume they will soon get them back again. That company used fo assist wrecks and get a subsidy. I always thought until to-night that the subsidy was continued. I cannot very well understand why it was discontinued, because they were rendering very excellent service. Is there any substantial reason for the discontinuance of that subsidy? I am not talking about the desirability of the. company getting the money, but I am looking to the security that shipowners would have.

But there is nothing for the Maritime Provinces, and so the item does not represent the facts quite correctly. However, I am not finding very much fault with that. If a subsidy is necessary on the St. Lawrence and the Pacific coast a subsidy should be granted for the protection of shipping on the Atlantic coast. We have more business on the Atlantic coast than there is in the gulf of St. Lawrence or on the Pacific coast. If you are going to give subsidies to wrecking plants in the St. Laurence and in British Columbia the harbours of Halifax and-St. John should have plants for the protection of shipping on the Atlantic coast. I would like to say a word of apprfeciation for what the Department of Marine and Fisheries does to help shipping on the Atlantic coast. Whilst we have no wrecking plant, if they have a steamer anywhere within 150 miles they send her to the assistance of a vessel
in distress. We have to give the department credit for that. They have rendered valuable service both around the Magdalen Islands and at other points. In the absence of the minister some few days ago I asked the Acting Minister if the department is sending a steamer to the Magdalen Islands this spring to help vessels there in oase they get into trouble. There are about a hundred ships up there. About three weeks ago there was a great deal of running ice about Grindstone island and at Grand Entry. It seems to me that if it is possible at all one of the Government vessels should be sent up there to look after these ships while they are in the North Bay and also fishing in the gulf of St. Lawrence.

Referring to the Dominion Steel Company, I have just been informed that the reason they discontinued work some four years ago was because they stated they no longer wished to perform any wrecking work, therefore the subsidy was no longer granted to them. Mr. Brookfield, who up to the time of the Halifax explosion owned and operated a large dry dock at Halifax, had a very modern and up-to-date wrecking plant, but unfortunately when the explosion took place his plant was destroyed. Another company, called the Reid Wrecking Company, are sending a wrecking equipment down to Halifax, and we hope before long to come to some arrangement with them, so that they will be in a position to look after the salvaging of any steamships off the Nova Scotia coast, just as the Quebec company does on the St. Lawrence route.

Next summer, on the first of July, the Quebec and Saguenay railway will be finished and in operation. Therefore, the steamship service will not be as necessary as it formerly was. I think it would be well if the department were to place the Champlain on a new route, for instance, between Murray Bay and Cap a l'Aigle, St. Fidele, and St. Simeon, and then across to Tadoussac. The navigation is good for the steamers at all times, even in the worst season in the fall, and if this is done the people in the district will reap the benefit of the new railway; otherwise they will not have the necessary facilities to connect with the railway. Then once or twice a week, when the weather permitted, the Champlain could cross over to Fraserville and thus give accommodation to people on both sides of the river. At the time I put the question to the Minister of Railways he told me to take the matter up with the department, and that is the reason I have brought it forward to-night.

The Champlain could also touch at Cap a l'Aigle, St. Fidele, St. Simeon, Murray Bay, and across to Riviere Ouelle. It would be a nice round trip, especially during the summer, would pay well, and furnish

ample accommodation to all the people on the south shore.

I call attention to a letter I wrote the department some time ago during the absence of the minister and his deputy, with regard to the necessity of placing two automatic buoys in the bay and harbour of Lunenburg. Lunenburg is the most important harbour on the Atlantic coast, outside of Halifax; large numbers of ships go in and out of that harbour both in summer and in winter. But the harbour is not properly buoyed, and if the matter is not attended to there may be a bad accident. Ships come in in the middle of the night; sometimes when they get part of the way in they have to put to sea again on account of the weather. I have known ships to come into the bay, go out again and have to remain out four or five days before the weather permitted their coming into the harbour. The department should not hesitate at the expense necessary to provide one or two buoys in a harbour like that. The only answer I received from the gentleman in charge of the department at the time was that the Lighthouse Board would not grant my request. But I think that I know more about the harbour of Lunenburg than the Lighthouse Board does. Some of these ships have crews of twenty

men, and it would be a terrible thing if any of them ran on the rocks in the harbour and serious loss of life and property resulted.

to the port of Quebec. I told him at that time that I had not seen the press report, but I have since advised him that it was due to three reasons: First, the owners had the ship destined for the port of New York, and not for the port of Quebec; second, the rate of insurance would, unfortunately, be higher if the ship came up the St. Lawrence route; and third, if one of those ships like the Olympic or the Aquitania reached the Beaujean bank at low tide they would have to wait until the tide would rise suffiicently to admit of vessels of their draught passing. But there is no doubt at all that the largest steamer afloat can come up the St. Lawrence river to the port of Quebec. There is ample water all the way along until they reach Beaujean bank, and if they .would wait until the tide rises they would not have any difficulty in getting over that bank. I have, therefore, no hesitation in making the staterfient quite clear for the public that those large steamers can come provided the owners want them to come to the port of Quebec.

Grand Etang has developed into quite an important port. There must be from . fifty to sixty large vessels fishing from this port, two steamers enter it twice a week, and a number of schooners. The harbour was only opened a few years ago. At present there is only one light, and it is practically no assistance to vessels seeking entrance at night; it is an artificial harbour, and the entrance is very narrow. I wrote to the Department- some time ago about this matter, and I have had several interviews with some of the officers of the department during the absence of the minister and his deputy. I think the minister's offiagrs will agree that I have not troubled them very much about matters of this kind, but in this case a light is essential, and I should be very grateful, as I am sure hundreds of people along that shore would be, if the minister would take this matter into his consideration, and have his officers make a report. I understand that a steamer goes down there once a year distributing oil to the lighthouses, and carrying officers of the department. I should like them to gather the necessary information with respect to the representations I have made, because 1 know when the minister has the facts he will see to it that this light is placed.

They are wharves that I always contend are used in connection with the Intercolonial railway. The only connection between the Intercolonial railway and the county of Victoria is from Iona to Baddeck. The Government built the Iona wharf for the railway, because the rails ran down on the wharf. The cars are shunted down to the end of the wharf and from the cars the freight is put into the boat. The Government accept freight
166i
in all parts of the continent of America for that point, and have to deliver that freight at Baddeck. They could never do without a wharf, and have built a very fine one at Baddeck.
There is no charge on the wharf at Iona where they receive the freight from the boat and from the railway while there is a charge on landing at Baddeck. These wharves are practically a part of the railway system and without the wharf at which they could land these goods at Baddeck the railway could not receive the goods.
I had that wharf built-at least that wharf was built when the Laurier government was in power and I had something to say about the patronage. There is a very excellent wharf built at Baddeck. The farmers and people generally,-particularly the farmers-complain about this little tinkering charge of 25 cents, 50 cents or $1 on their freight. It does not amount to very much but it does not leave the wharf free as it used to. The wharf at Iona is free and the same rule .should apply to the one at Baddeck. I have brought this up before, but I believe the same charges are still collected at Baddeck.

SINCLAIR:,,SUPPLY.,,,"I am not advocating pensions for the pilots in all the other ports, because I think it would involve a considerable expenditure, and I am not sure that it would be justified. But I think the department is making a mistake in treating the St. Lawrence pilots differently from pilots in other parts of the country. I think this was due to the system of patronage that existed, and may still exist, whereby too many pilots were appointed in the St. Lawrence, with the result that they were crowding one another, and the country had to take the load and bear it. I regard that as a blunder. I would like to see some arrangement by which this could be struck off altogether instead of spreading it all over the country. That would seem to me to be the better plan. We cannot afford to be throwing away money, as money is now very scarce. Economy is absolutely necessary at the present time. Spending money unnecessarily is the sin of extravagance, which is like the sin against the Holy Ghost; it should not, and it will not, be forgiven by the people.

If this Order in Council was passed by the late Administration, it must have been for certain good reasons and after due consideration. As the minister has well said he is face to face with a certain condition which was created by a previous minister who was aware of the special circumstances in the province of Quebec, and who, after weighing the circumstances, decided to establish this fund and make these payments. I do not see how the Government can very well get out of the payment now. If the pilots of other parts of the country have not been able to secure a pension I am very sorry for them, but they should have looked out for themselves and asked to he included in this Order in Council at the time it was passed. It is not too late to do that now when Orders in Council seem to be so popular wdth the present Government. It would be easy enough to pass an Order in Council providing pensions for the pilots of other provinces, and I would not object to it. It is only reasonable that these men, after their long service for the department, should get some consideration. I do not think the amount should be reduced, and personally I would be in favour of the same consideration being extended to other pilots.

For a number of years I have been bringing to the attention of the Government the case of the town of Canso and vicinity, where there is a- good deal of shipping but where no proper provision is made for the care of seamen. The banks lie off Cape Canso, and this port is the main refuge for fishing vessels. Large numbers of ships go in there for shelter, for bait, to land supplies, and so on. Many sailors frequent that port. Dr. McGarry has been appointed a physician there to give some attention to the sailors, but I am told by him that the department refuses to pay for the drugs. They give him a pit"" tance for looking after the port, which is quite inadequate, and then they compel him to pay for the medicine he gives to the sailors. He has taken the matter up with the department, but no attention has been paid to his letters. The price of drugs has increased enormously during the last few years, and it is not fair that the doctors should have to pay for them under these circumstances. The number of cases that the doctor at this port has had to attend to has also increased, but apparently no interest is taken by the department in the necessity for providing medicines for these sick sailors. The ship-owners are paying the money; the minister is accumulating the fund-I do not know what he is doing with it. But no improvement has been made, at that port at all events, in the method of taking care of sick seamen.

made to the service carried on by the steamer Champlain in my county. I understand that this steamer was taken off the service last fall and the year previous because she was not in a seaworthy condition and some repairs had to be made to her engine and boilers. I am told on good authority that this steamer, which was acquired by the Government fifteen or sixteen years ago and has voyaged in rough seas and rough weather most of the time, cannot be trusted at all seasons and in all weathers. For service on the route that I and the member for Temiscouata (Mr. Gauvreau) have suggested to-night, it would be well for the department to see that the

boat is properly inspected and put in seaworthy condition in the spring, or even in the fall, so that she may remain on the service during the whole of the season when the people are most in need of her services. About the month of October the people on the north shore are absolutely cut off from all communication. If this boat was put in order during the early summer or early in September, she would be available at all times during the winter season.

It is very unfair not to permit the fisnermen along the coast to get the advantage of this Sick Mariners' Fund. There is no reason why a change should not be made in the law with a view to enabling the department to permit these fishermen to participate in the fund. Let them collect so much from the fishermen, who are ready to pay a reasonable amount in order that they may get the benefit of the fund. There could be no better way of using the surplus at present to the credit of the fund than to improve the treatment of these sick fishermen. Although I am not a very apt politician, I remember that a policy of that kind was promised to the fishermen of that part of Nova Scotia a good many years ago. The fishermen were promised free medical treatment if they would support a certain party. If they offered that policy as an inducement, they must have regarded it as acceptable to the fishermen. I know that it would be acceptable to them; it would be a splendid thing for them. In my own port of Margaree, where there are perhaps one hundred and fifty fishermen, it would be a splendid thing if these men could have the advantage of the Sick Mariners' Fund; I amVure that they would be glad to contribute to the fund in order to obtain the benefit of it. I suggest very strongly that the minister, who is disposed to look kindly on these suggestions, give this matter every consideration.

There is an increase over last year in practically every item. Now we all know that immigration has very much decreased, and we would naturally expect the expenditure to decrease, or at all events remain stationary. I find by page 72 of the public accounts that in 1908, when a large number of immigrants were entering Canada and we were carrying on an active propaganda in Europe and the principal cities of the United States, the expenditure of the department was only $960,000, whereas in 1917 it was $1,181,000, and in 1918 $1,211,000. The expenditure seems to be increasing with the decrease in the number of immigrants. It seems very unsatisfactory, and I should like the minister to explain this inverse ratio and why no attempt has been made during the last three or four years, when practically no immigrants were coming in, to Teduee the expenditure of the department.

The expenses of the administration of the department probably are a little high, and the leader of the Opposition is quite correct in drawing attention to past expenditures when there was such a tremendous rush to this country. I wish to draw his attention, however, to this: A great deal of the trouble we have in Canada to-day is due to the fact that we did not have in former days sufficient supervision over immigration with the result that men came into our country who should not be admitted. We have these men to-day; they constitute the problem which the Minister of Immigration has to deal with. We are to-day paying for the follies of past administration, and I think- it is absolutely unfair to charge it up to the present minister when it is the men who preceded him who were guilty of the wrong-doing.
For my part, I wish to see a vigorous immigration policy continued. Hon. gentlemen in the East may be quite content to sit down and suck their thumbs and do nothing to help the country, and it looks to me as if that is what has happened in some localities in the East. In the past year I took a trip through the province from which the leader of the Opposition comes and also through New Brunswick. It was the first time I had visited that country, which I expected to see so completely filled with people that it would be without opportunity to make any large increase to its population. But I was amazed to find mile upon mile of what looked to me to be exceedingly good land, with apparently no settlers. The thought was forced upon me that the people in that part of the Dominion were awfully deficient in that element of virtue which we call progress. It is about time that the

Minister of Immigration from the West went down into that part of Canada to wake the people up a little hit, because it seems to me they have a magnificent country and they are making very little use of it compared with what they might. We in Western Canada do not intend to sit down and wait for immigrants to come in of their own free will under the system which has been followed in the Eastern Provinces in days gone by. We know that we have a mighty good country, and until we get it peopled we cannot expect to have the social conditions which we would like to have, because scarcity of population is very disadvantageous to contentment. We have 'millions upon millions of acres of fine land. It may be true that a great deal of this has gotten into the hands of private individuals under the wrong policy which was followed in the earlier days. But is the Minister of Immigration going to sit down and do nothing to overcome those conditions which have been thrust upon him? I say no. And if he does I can assure him there is nobody in the country who will more vigorously oppose him than I. I quite agree that the endeavour to get immigrants from the Western States is a correct policy.
The best .settlers we have in Western Canada to-day came from (Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Western States. Thousands of people are crowding in from the United States. These people are very much like ourselves. In the early days, when they started to come, they had a very peculiar notion of British institutions. Many of them thought they were coming to live under-well, almost what you would expect from the Czar of Russia of those days. They believed that we were a mere colony, and that we got our laws and everything else from the King of England. Of late their notions of Canada .have been entirely changed; they now know that they enjoy the same justice and the same liberty that they enjoyed in the United States. Hundreds of townships are settled by people from the American side. We are glad to have them, and I hope that the minister will continue the .policy of trying to induce such people to come to. Canada. There is any amount of land in Western Canada for thousands of immigrants from such places as I have mentioned, as well as for our returned soldiers. If we are finding a little difficulty in getting just the land that the returned soldiers want, that is noit the fault of the land. The land is there, and it is up to us to evolve a system under which it will be made available. I 164
am confident, from what I hear, that we will satisfactorily settle that problem very shortly. In the meantime, the Committee ought to give the minister a very substantial vote in order that he may further the objects of his department. I am quite prepared to give him a year in which (to evolve a proper policy, 'and to give him even longer than that to remedy the defects that he found in his department as a result of the maladministration of years gone by.

In my judgment, there is greater necessity for this department than there is for any other department in the public service. No matter of Government is of as much interest to the people as is immigration and colonization. When you consider what the condition is to-day in. Canada-I endeavoured to make that clear in the statement I made to the House when the Immigration Bill was brought down- you must come to the conclusion that this matter should have received the attention of the Government long ago. We should have had a department of the Government in charge of a minister of the Crown who was prepared to give his entire time and energies to that part of the public service. Why have we in Canada only about 8,000,000 people, while south of the line the population is about 115,000,000? Simply because the question of the settlement and development of this country has not been properly dealt with by past Governments. There is exceedingly important work to be done, and if that work is carried out as it should be and if the necessary appropriations are made available to the minister in charge of the department, whoever he may be, in order that he may carry on his work properly, results will be secured that will re-pay Canada a hundredfold for any expenditures that are incurred. The matter has been too long neglected. True, we had an Immigration and Colonization branch of the Interior Department, but scarcely any one knew it was in existence. One minister after another paid but passing attention to it, because he had larger and what he considered to be more important duties- to attend to. But if this country is to come into her own; if it is to be developed as it should; if we are to get the kind of im-



migration that we should, then this subject must not be neglected as it has been in the past. We have an abundance of room. Opportunities are lying around in every part of Canada, in land settlement as well as in the development of our resources generally. The problem which stares the nation in the face will never be satisfactorily dealt with if we pursue a niggardly policy; unless the moneys necessary for this work are made available, we shall go on drifting as we have gone on in the past. Other countries are looking for settlers. New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa know the value of this class of work and have been spending two or three times what Canada has been spending for the development of their countries. If we are to compete with them; if we are to get our share of the immigrants from the Motherland, we must be prepared to spend the necessary money.
The hon. gentleman said that I have not brought down the information asked for. Well, it is difficult to anticipate the range of questions to be asked on an occasion of this kind, but I endeavoured to give as much information as I had at hand, and I think I have fairly met the demands for information. I have been asked to bring down a statement of the quantity of lands available in every province. May I point out to my hon. friend that even the people in his own province do not know that? Not a single Provincial Premier or Provincial Government could answer that question. At the conference we had here last November, I suggested to the Premiers of the provinces that they put on their Statute Books at once a law providing for an inventory of the natural resources of their respective provinces. Some of them have done so; some of them have started to obtain this information. But at the present time, fortunately or unfortunately, neither the Dominion Government nor the Provincial Governments have real knowledge of the amount of land that is available for settlement in the different provinces. I trust that arrangements will be made by all the provinces at an early date to obtain full and reliable information on this subject.
I agree with the leader of the Opposition that some serious mistakes have been made in the past so far as land settlement in Western Canada is concerned. We have allowed settlers to drift all over the country and to settle in places many miles from railways; and the difficulties of the Western Provinces have thereby been seriously multiplied. If a plan could have been devised
IMr. Calder. ]
in the past under which settlement would have gone forward .as railway development went forward, it would have meant a great saving of expense and trouble in a hundred different directions. But I wish to assure the Committee that that is no easy matter. As long as vacant lands are there, it is most difficult to hold people from going on to them. We have such things as squatters' rights, and if those lands are available anywhere within fifty or sixty miles of a railway, and if they are first-class lands, the squaluar is going to get out on that land if he possibly can. That has been the experience in all the provinces of western Canada, so that I doubt very much, even if the Government desired to do so, it could have prevented settlement of that character.
The hon. gentleman also referred to the lack of land for Soldier Settlement. That, of course, had reference only to homestead lands within a reasonable distance of railways. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, there is an abundance of homestead land, although not all of first class character, but the great bulk of it is not within easy reach of existing railway facilities, and it was because those in authority here felt it would be unfair to ask soldiers to go to lands lying more than fifteen miles from a railway, that provision was afterwards made whereby those returned men might secure purchased land instead of having to go out long distances from railway facilities.
The hon. member for Pontiac (Mr. Cahill) referred to the price of land in western Canada and apparently thought I was far out in my calculation as to what lands were worth. I believe I have a fairly accurate idea as to what lands are selling and being held at in the West. Two days ago, I sold for $15 an acre a piece of land I had held for ten or twelve years, and it is not more than four miles to a railway and it is good average land. I will not say that figure will represent the average price of land in western Canada.

Those conditions are, of course, very broad and comprehensive, embracing a multitude of

things. We have not been losing our agriculturalists in this country. Those who have been leaving are mainly urban people; or, if agriculturalists have been leaving, it is because they wished to enter business or engage in industry. I presume that the very large emigration from this country has been very largely due to the rapid expansion of the trade and commerce and industry of the United States in every direction, which has made opportunities for our young men to enter business, and I dare say that condition will continue. I quite well remember when I visited my old home town in Western Ontario after living in Western Canada for some time, that the old boys whom I used to know had practically all gone to the United States to enter business, because the opportunities there were very much greater than in Canada. In my judgment, what we need in Canada more than anything else Is an increased rural population, and I quite agree with the hon. member that we must establish in this country-and this applies to the Provincial Governments and Municipal Governments as well as to the Federal Government-conditions that will make our rural people content and prosperous and happy, because unless we do that we can never succeed in holding them. The question how it shall be done is a very complex one. The Provincial Governments have a very large duty to perform in that direction; the municipalities, if you will, have also their duties, and the Federal Government has its duty to perform. The question of good roads has a very important bearing on the problem; the question of education, the extended use of telephones, the establishment of social centres, and a hundred and one other things have to be considered, and I am free to admit that the fiscal policy of the country also has a marked bearing on the question. But the main thing is this : If we are going to get and maintain a rural population in this country it is absolutely essential that all parties concerned should combine to make conditions in the rural districts such as will lead to the contentment, prosperity and happiness of the rural population.

It is all very well to induce new immigration, but if we continue to lose those we already have our last condition
DMir. Calder.]
will be worse than our first. An amendment has just been made to the Immigration Act which I felt was just a little too stringent, and I believe the result will be simply this: Some of our people in this country will convey to their friends at home news of the stringent regulations now existing and the disabilities under which they labour in this *country as a result of certain steps on the part of this Government, and then we shall not obtain the immigration we otherwise might have had. To-day we are pretty well circumscribed as to the countries from which immigration can be drawn, practically the only country from which we can expect-immigrants being the British Isles. One hop. member a week or so ago urged that no immigrants should be admitted from the southern countries of Europe. That suggestion was pretty far-reaching and was not adopted. The Central Empires, Germany and Austria, will no longer be permitted to send immigrants to this country. The manhood of France has -been so much depleted that there is no possibility of our getting immigrants from that country. I am very doubtful, indeed, whether we shall receive a large immigration from the British Isles for some time to come. As the minister must know, the United States to-day, instead of receiving immigrants, is losing its immigrants. It may be true that those they are losing belong to a class which the United States does not care to retain, but it may be otherwise. I saw by the papers a few days ago that already steps have been taken by no fewer than a million people in the United States to return to their old homes; I do not know whether all these people are aliens, or whether any or all of them were naturalized. The paper went on to state that an exodus was expected from the United States of
5,000,000 people. If that is true, I should like to know whether the minister has any knowledge of a similar movement among our population'. If it is true, it would probably not be the men who are settled on our western farms who are leaving, but the people from our cities and towns. After all, we have a population of only seven or eight million, and I firmly believe that the Government ought to make every effort to keep every immigrant who shows possibility of developing into a good Canadian, citizen. It would be a pity if the Government directed its energies towards bringing in one immigrant, while at the same time iit was losing two immigrants that had already settled 'here just for want of a little effort to induce them

to stay. Has the -minister any knowledge of any large amount of emigration from this country such as apparently is the case with the United States, and if so, what efforts are being made to retain these people?
I entirely agree with the minister that the one thing we want in this country is more people. We have a debt of two billions of dollars, and I do not see how we can meet our exceedingly heavy obligations unless we fill the country up with people who will develop its natural resources. I think our energies should be directed along that line, and we should also remove the restrictions under which the people of this oountry have been labouring for several years, in order that people who are now here will be content to stay and others who are desirable may come.

We shall have to be very careful with regard to immigration in the future and see that we build up in our western provinces, and throughout Canada generally, a real Canadian citizenship. It is appalling to think, first, of the number of native Canadians, and, secondly, of the number of immigrants who have been brought to Canada with good Canadian money, who have left this country during ithe la^t thirty or forty years.
Sir Richard	Cartwright,	referring	tothe number	of persons	who	hadleft Canada	within a	certain	period-I think	he meant	the decade
(between 1882 and 1892-said that Canada had lost as many immigrants, whose entrance to this country had been advertised and paid for, as the Americans lost soldiers during the whole of the Civil war. A Canadian has only to travel to Boston to find that that city is practically an annex of -Nova Scotia; and if he went to Chicago he would find there between 30,000 and 40,000 Canadians, both French and English, who, d know as a matter of fact, are a power in municipal and Congressional elections. Some years ago my hon. friend Senator Dandurand and I were delegated at Sault Ste. Marie to represent Canada at the semicentennial anniversary of the Sault Ste. Marie canal. In the afternoon we were called upon to address a gathering at which the Vice-president of the United States the late Mr. Fairbanks, was also present, and I was rather surprised when we were
requested to speak in French. To my profound astonishment I discovered that in that gathering of about ten thousand people there were at least 5,000 French Canadians. That was in the State of Michigan which is partly French. West Bay city and many other cities, not to speak of the city of Detroit, are largely populated with Canadians. And if you went to Philadelphia you would come across so many Canadians from Hamilton and London and Toronto that you would be under the impression that you were in Canada. In fact, the entire United States to-day is dotted with Canadian -Clubs, and you cannot go into any city in the United States in which there are Canadians to any appreciable extent without finding a Canadian Club. These clubs are fashionable.institutions. This will show that there is in the republic to the south of us a very large population of Canadians of both races and if what my hon. friend said a moment ago is true, and I believe it is, that we cannot hope to get from Europe as many immigrants as we got before the war, I think we should turn our attention to the Canadians who are in the United States, and who to-day, knowing the value of Canadian lands and appreciating their country as they do, would be only too pleased to return to their Mother Country if sufficient inducement were offered. I may speak particularly of those Canadians settled in the United States who belong to my own race-the French Canadian. I think I am within the mark in stating that there are in the United States to-day at least two million French Canadians. The largest French cities in America 'outside of Montreal and Quebec, are New England	cities-Lowell,
Fall River, and many others, where there are French Canadians in every municipal council, in every legislature, on the bench and in every profession. And I know from the members of the Canadian hierarchy that they are obliged to supply the clergy of the United States with French Canadian priests. The cause of the emigration of the French Canadian to the United States is very well known. First of all, the French Canadian is adventuresome, and was so under the old French regime. The Kiug of France had to enact severe laws to restrain the French Canadians, or Canadians as they were called in those days from leaving the settlements. The term ""French Canadian"" dates back only twenty or twenty-five years. In the old days, even under the French, there was quite a marked distinction between a ""Canadian"" and a ""Frenchman."" Montcalm in his letters to the min-

ister in France always refers to the Canadians as the permanent inhabitants of Canada, and to the French as the men in His Majesty's troops. We all know the history of the famous coureurs des bois under the French regime. They were always away from the lands in quest of the fur trade with the redmen and by reason of that peculiar love of adventure these Canadians were encountered in every part of the continent, in the Mississippi Valley, near the Rocky mountains, in the wilds of Kansas and down to New Mexico. Later on, under the British domination you found them in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and roving all over the continent. In the forties quite a large number of French Canadians left for California, lured by the discovery of the gold mines there; and again they were attracted by the discovery of the gold fields in Australia. Later on in the seventies, as the minister said a moment ago, the industrial unrest in Canada was responsible for a considerable emigration of French Canadians, to the New England States, with the result that in all these cities in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York there are large colonies of my fellow countrymen. They have succeeded, but it is surprising to know that a large number of those French Canadians would like to return to Canada. Better circumstances and a keener appreciation of the surroundings of the old homestead appeal to their imagination, and 11 know that if a real movement were instituted to draw from that large population some settlers to Canada, the hon. minister would undoubt-edlv find there a very interesting field. There are some societies and some members of the clergy who are deeply interested in bringing back to Canada as many as possible of that population, and I hope that my hon. friend will encourage that movement because it is a healthy one. The French Canadian is essentially a good settler. History proves that. Those Canadians belong to the oldest stock in Confederation and should be encouraged to return and settle on the old homesteads. There is one society in Montreal, and, if I mistake not, there is one in the city of Ottawa, and there is, or was some years ago, one in Quebec. The Quebec Government has done something in the way of subsidizing these societies, but as the question of repatriation is under the control of my hon. friend, I expect he will do his little share towards achieving what I consider would be quite a success. My hon. friend said a moment ago that the province generally did not know the value and extent
CMr. I.emieux ]
of their land fit for * cultivation. I believe his statement is right. It has only been in the last few years that we in the province of Quebec have realized the richness, the enormous value of our resources in lumbering, pulp manufacturing and wheat growing in the new district of Abitibi. Since the National Transcontinental railway has reached this far away region quite a population has settled there and I am told that this district is certainly full of promise. I know as a matter of fact that the Quebec Government intends to cooperate with the Dominion in connection with the land .settlement of our soldiers. My friend, the Premier of Quebec, was here on Saturday and I was speaking to him about Abiti'bi. He then said to me that his policy was to direct, as far as possible, returned soldiers to take up lands in that new district. The Government of Quebec has accepted the views which were expressed by my hon. friend at the last Dominion-provincial conference and are willing to co-operate with him towards the land settlement of our returned soldiers. Once more let me say that I expect that my hon. friend will do something towards the repatriation movement of the French Canadians. It is really sad to think that there are in the United States such a large number of our countrymen, not only French Canadians but English Canadians. This is a great loss to Canada and if we can induce even a small portion of the large Canadian population which has settled in the United States to return, I think it will be the best work performed by the Immigration Department.

It is only within the last week or two that I had a communication from Mr. Cumming, who is head of the Department of Agriculture there, and he was very anxious to know what stand we are going to take to assist settlement on the abandoned farm, or the semi-abandoned farm; that is a farm which is not cultivated up to its full use. They have that trouble in Nova Scotia just as they have it all through Southern Ontario. One of the real problems in the older portions of Canada, and not only in Nova Scotia, is the question of getting a real, live new settler who will take the place of the person who is working a farm in a half-hearted way. In addition to that, you have the abandoned farm. That is a question that has grown up all through the older part of Canada, and you have there an aspect of this question which requires the most serious consideration, not only on the part of the local Government, but on the part of the Federal Government as well

It is only within the last month that there has been established in each of the Prairie Provinces an association representing private owners of land, and we have made arrangements whereby all inquiries reaching our offices in the United States will be forwarded to those associations. As the Committee will understand, the situation to-day is very different from what it was ten or fifteen years ago when an abundance of homestead land was available throughout the West. The landseeker from the United States is to-day looking rather for a piece of land which he can purchase within existing settlements than for outlying homestead lands, and consequently, we are creating machinery, both in the United States and Canada, whereby the prospective land-seeker may be put in touch with owners of land who have them for sale.

those agents in foreign countries the min-

ister will find his way clear to appoint one in Belgium. We have already an agent in France; the Hon. Philippe Roy is the Canadian Commissioner in Paris, and as the minister stated a moment ago, after the tremendous loss of life suffered by France during the last war, we cannot expect the French Government to facilitate the work of any immigration agent, but in Belgium, I am informed, that there are good prospects for immigration. Before the war a movement was on foot to send immigrants from Belgium to Canada and the minister knows that the Belgians belong to the better class if immigrants. As gardeners around the Yarge cities, such afe Toronto and especially Montreal, the Belgians have done wonders, and if inducements could be put forward, I believe the refugees especially who are at present in England would willingly come to Canada. I think there are in the Northwest one or two Belgian colonies, one being in Manitoba. The province of Quebec has in Brussels an agent, Mr. Langlois, formerly a journalist in Montreal, who is, I believe, publishing a paper called ""Belgi-que-Canada,"" the first issue of which I saw the other day. The future seems to be very bright from an immigration standpoint, and I would urge upon the minister to appoint somebody in Brussels to act in conjunction with Mr. Langlois. Some years ago the Hon. Mr. Sifton, now Sir Clifford Sifton, appointed two agents in Belgium, and for a while we had quite a stream of immigrants from that country. If the Belgium is not a farmer, he is so thrifty and industrious that he is capable of adapting himself practically to any business in the country and from all points of view he is a very desirable immigrant.

The department was created in December, 1917. We then had an outside staff of 459. In March of this year we had a staff of 344, a decrease of 115. These figures were obtained in this way. We closed 21 halls and the salaries
of the officers who were in charge of these halls, and who were retired amounted to $8,590. Most of them were simply caretakers. I found these halls open and expenditures going on for fuel, light, heat, repairs and so on* while many of them were not used at all. In a number of cases not a single immigrant had been in these halls for months. Something less than ten are still open. I do not mean to say that if we find it necessary in connection with our work these expenditures might not increase again, but I shall see to it that these halls are not reopened or kept in operation unless there are immigrants to be accommodated in them. At various interior points, such as Saskatoon, Moosejaw or Regina, in past years, when we were dealing with homesteaders in large numbers, we found it necessary to have agenoies established. We have decreased the staffs of these agencies to the extent of fifty-two persons. These persons had been kept at these offices continuously .for years practically after the work that they were appointed to do had very largely ceased. They were retired and their annual salaries amounted to $50,070. During the war we found it necessary to appoint a number of officials whose duty it was to issue permits to those who were leaving Canada to enter the United States. We have retired twenty of these officers with an annual saving of $14,350. Our boundary staffs were also overhauled and as a consequence thirty-one officers were retired representing an annual saving of $31,300. A number of officials resigned, some were transferred to other departments, and one or two died. In that connection we retired thirty-seven officials representing a saving of $32,490. This makes a total reduction in our staff of 158, representing an annual saving in salaries of $136,800. That is one side of the account. We found it necessary to make some appointments.

Amongst those there were some officials retired where they should not have been retired. A further investigation showed that nine

of these men were absolutely needed. That makes a total of 43. Deducting that number from the 158 we have a net reduction in the Outside Service of 115 officers representing an annual saving of $98,340. In the United States we closed three offices and retired ten officials, the net saving there being about $6,000.

Nevertheless, we did receive somewhere in the neighbourhood of sixty thousand people from the United States last year, and some seventy-five thousand people the year before, and there was every indication last year that there might have been a very much larger movement. However, there is the other viewpoint: In the field of immigration you cannot always get results immediately. That is, you must carry on your publicity work in such a way as to so affect people that they will move probably in two, thsee, or four years from the time when they first began to read about Canada. I feel that we must keep up our publicity work with that object in view. As a matter of fact, I think we should have expended a larger amount of money in Great Britain for the same reason.

control over the provision that is made for

the shipping of stock from different ports? At certain seasons of the year there is considerable live stock shipped from the port of North Sydney to Newfoundland, and people there who are interested in the prevention of cruelty to animals complain very often that cattle are not provided with proper shelter. When they come by train and have to wait for a day or two or more for the boat, sometimes they suffer considerably through exposure and lack of proper attention. At the request of a gentleman from Antigonish who was in the cattle business I brought this matter to the notice of the Department of Agriculture last year, when. I was told by the Minister of Agriculture that the Minister of Railways had to do with such accommodation. I wish to bring it now to the notice of the minister as I see he is providing for something in connection with live stock at these places. Is there any person at the port of North Sydney whose business it is to inspect cattle that are shipped to Newfoundland?
Mr. BAlLLANTYNE :	The Department ol
Marine has no control over live stock that is landed on the wharves at North Sydney. Our regulations apply to live stock when on board ship. The Minister of Agriculture ,was quite right last year when, in his answer to the hon. member, he said that the taking care of cattle on the wharves at North Sydney was in the jurisdiction of the Minister of Railways. Our regulations with regard to cattle on board ship cover:
1-	The number of live stock the ship is adapted to carry.
2-	The number actually on board for intended voyage.
3-	That the arrangements for carrying live stock are approved by inspector.
4-	That the shelters or fittings are substantial enough to ensure safety of live stock for the voyage.
5-	That ship is seaworthy.
Our jurisdiction begins and ends in seeing that live stock are properly taken care of when on board ship.

I am very sorry that I misunderstood the leader of the Opposition in reference to his question as to the amount of land available in Canada for settlement. I was viewing the situation from this, and I think from the right standpoint; that the whole question of settlement and colonization does not apply merely to federal land, it is being equally applicable to all Canada. When the hon. gentleman asked if I had information regarding the land available for settlement I naturally assumed that he had in his mind the whole of Canada, not merely that portion of it which happens to be the federal domain. I wish to assure him that I was not endeavouring to escape his question by any subterfuge, because if the Department of Immigration and Colonization is going to prove of service to Canada, that service must be to the whole Dominion. It is not right that the Federal Government should pass laws and expend money merely for the settlement of those portions of Western Canada in which it has lands. It is from that standpoint that I have endeavoured to approach this problem, and it was from that standpoint that 'I had a conference last fall with the representatives of all the provinces in Canada and endeavoured to secure their co-operation in connection with it. It appears to me that what the hon. member for Maison-neuve (Mr. Lemieux) has said is quite correct; we have found a new Canada because in the northern part of Quebec there is valuable territory that we did not know existed a short time ago, and the same is true to a large extent of Northern Ontario. The province of British Columbia is in my judgment the richest province in Canada, but it has not had the agricultural development it should have. I took this matter up with the various provinces and endeavoured to ascertain their available land resources for settlement purposes; but I have found that neither here at Ottawa, nor in the records of their own Provincial Governments, was there anything like a reliable or accurate record of one of the principal resources that we have in this country-that is land fit for settlement-I endeavoured to prevail upon them as to the necessity of our getting an inventory of this land just as quickly as we possibly could, and all the premiers and their colleagues who were present concurred in that.
Some of them have already passed laws with a view to securing that inventory. In tackling the question of the settlement of Crown lands, lands in the possession of ithe provinces, and privately owned lands, we must first find out what we have. Notwithstanding what my hon. friend has said, I may point out that when I was in Nova Scotia I found Premier Murray and all his colleagues intensely interested in this question so far as Nova Scotia was concerned. We spent four or five hours together at Halifax, considering the problem from every standpoint. They realize that the land of that province is not being used to its full capacity; that good lands are only half used, some of them not used at all, and they want to devise ways and means whereby that land may at the earliest day be used to the full. So that in the old province, of Nova Scotia, where the Crown lands axe all gone, there is an immigration problem. We must not forget that the expenditures made by the Federal Government in the past for immigration and colonization have not been made for Western Canada alone. It is true that the majority of the settlers have gone into Western Canada, but in the propaganda that we carry on in the United States and Great Britain and that was carried on in the various countries of Europe, no attempt has been made to deal only with one portion of Canada. In any case, if that has been done in the past it certainly should not continue in the future. The Federal Government must be impartial in this matter; it must treat all paTts of Canada alike. We must have a national policy not a sectional policy. It is of the utmost importance that the closest co-operation should exist between the Federal .Government and the provincial governments; that in this House should deal with the matter not from the local but from the national standpoint, and that whatever work we carry on outside of Canada should be carried on from the national standpoint, not from the standpoint of settling only those lands in Western Canada that belong to the Crown.

I cannot see the necessity for making an investigation. Unfortunately, there are Mennonites and Mennonites and those who live in Western Canada know the conditions existing there. Some of the members of the Committee know that quite recently I received a visit from six bishops belonging to that sect, who stated that they represented some
10,000	souls in the three provinces of Western Canada. They belong to the old colony of Mennonites, that portion of the sect that is absolutely opposed to sending their children to the public schools. They have been in the West for thirty, forty, or fifty years, and as members of the Committee probably are aware, the Provincial Governments in the West have had all sorts of trouble in endeavouring to induce those people to take advantage of our public school system. Unfortunately, however, they have not seen their way clear to do so, and it is that very fact that has given rise to the agitation in Western Canada for the exclusion of those people from the country until such time as they are prepared to observe the education and other laws of the country. It is very unfortunate this condition should prevail, but there it is. I am well acquainted with many of our Mennonite settlements in Western Canada and with the people, and those who have broken away from the old ideas are law-abiding, moral living people; they have no bad habits; they are great producers; -they are making great progress from many standpoints, and they make very desirable citizens. But so long as a large section of those people hold out against coming under the education laws of the Western Provinces, an agitation will prevail to exclude them from entering Canada.

He answers by asking how much land we have in Nova Scotia. What difference does that make? There is this system of surveys the system of the allocation of lands, in the different provinces on which we are spending millions of money. We are ascertaining the quality of the land, the location and extent of timber limits, water-powers and everything that appertains to our vast properties in the West. Under these circumstances have we not the right to ask the minister how much is available for immigration and settlement? A minister of the Crown who is the head of a department whose officers are all over the country getting this information, and which has its agents working from coast to coast selling this land, should be supposed to be in possession of that information and it is hardly to be expected that he will answer a question of that kind by saying: Why should you ask for such information when your own department of coal mines in Nova Scotia would not be able to supply you with similar information. We have, as incidental to the department of the provincial secretary in Nova Scotia, a sort of a little side show in the form of the Department of Agriculture which is not a department by itself. It pays some attention .to immigration, but we have no well organized immigration department in Nova Scotia.
I am sorry that the minister should have replied in this way instead of answering my question as to the knowledge which we should possess in this House of what lands the Government have in the West. Hehasnot answered that question except by referring me to what is happening in the Maritime

Provinces. Let me say to the minister that it is essential to getting immigrants to come to this country and keeping them here that we should keep our word to them and deal fairly and honestly with them. I charge the minister with having knowledge of the fact that immigrants came into Canada under the pledge of a statute of this Dominion which told them: ""When you enter Canada and become naturalized, you become a British subject; the pledge of the King is handed down to you by that statute, which is that you shall always be dealt with as a British subject.""
We had thousands of those people in this Dominion in 1917, but notwithstanding this pledge the Minister of Immigration was a party to violating the statute, breaking the pledge of His Majesty the King to the King's subjects, by depriving them of the franchise. Instead of allowing those people to enjoy the franchise the Government disqualified them and told them: ""You are British subjects, you have taken the oath of allegiance, this statute guarantees to you all the rights of British subjects, but nevertheless we are not keeping the pledge of the King to you in extending and continuing to you these rights."" Far be it from me to say that you should extend any rights to any man who shows any sign of disloyalty to the King; I would be just as bitter as anybody in saying to any such person coming to Canada: ""There is no room here for anybody but a true loyal subject of the King."" But what are we to do in the case of a man who comes here and takes the oath of allegiance and behaves in an absolutely right and proper manner in connection with every duty he is called upon to perform. As long as such a man does that he is entitled to the due fulfilment of the promises which were made to him. There were thousands of people in Canada in 1917 against whose loyalty not one black mark could be found; all that could be said was that they came here from countries that are possibly now at war with us, but they took the oath of allegiance and have observed to the letter every duty which devolved upon them. Nevertheless the sins of the fathers were visited upon the children to the third and fourth generation; and the Minister of Immigration, knowing that these people did not deserve it at his hands, was a party to cutting them away from that which is deaTer to a man almost than any other right that he possesses-the right of participating in the government of the country in which he lives. I hope the minister will always keep 
in mind that whatever promises we make to immigrants coming to Canada shall be observed to the letter, particularly when we solemnly sit down here and pass a statute in which we grant certain rights to newcomers. That statute received the consent of His Majesty the King, and it then became the law of the land; and we should be very careful and have the very best proof that it is necessary to break away from the pledges and promises therein set forth before we adopt such a policy. I submit, therefore, to the minister that his department should bear in mind that people coming into Canada should be allowed to enjoy those rights and exercise those privileges which have been promised to them, so long as they will do and maintain on their part what is expected of them as British subjects. I submit that has not been done on the Government's part in the past, and it accounts to a very great extent for the smallness of the immigration entering Canada just now from countries beyond the seas. Because, the Britisher from the United Kingdom, although he is a British subject, does not like to see others unfairly treated, and does not caTe to go to another country which he understands has treated immigrants as immigrants coming to Canada have been treated. The minister says I was very wrong in saying anything about the synchronizing of the formation of this department with the organization of the Unionist Government. I venture to tell him that 'the Unionist Government had very little in mind in regard 'to immigration and colonization at that time. It was not a period when immigrants were entering Canada or when commercial interests were very greatly thought of. That Government was organized for one purpose, and one purpose only; and it is vain for the minister to tell me that after the Department of the Interior had for fifty years been managing all the branches pertaining to this work, that it dawned upon him in the middle of the war that it was necessary to create a new department to handle people that were not coming to Canada. I have my own view's about -the matter, and the minister has his; but when he makes a -statement, and I make another contrary to his, the circumstances of the case strongly confirm my assertion as to the synchronizing which took place at the time of the formation of the Unionist Government.

We have enormous resources in this country; on a conservative estimate, the amount of arable land in this country suitable for settlement is at least one hundred million acres, scattered all over the provinces. Our homestead lands adjacent to railways-I am speaking of federal lands now-have to a very large extent been settled on. But there is an abundance of
other land, valued at from $15 to $20 an acre, and this is a fact that is easily brought to the attention of prospective settlers. Those who have been coming to Canada from the United States during the past few years have not been seeking homesteads to any great extent, but have been purchasing this land fairly freely. It is estimated that in Alberta and Saskatchewan alone there are about 25,000,000 acres of this kind of land which, so long as it does not exceed $25 or $30 an >acre, will be quite an attraction to those who are looking for farms in a new country. The work of the department is to inform intending immigrants of this fact. This is being done in the United States through our agencies, and by advertising, publicity campaigns and various other means, and it is partially as a result of the activities of the department that settlers are coming to Canada. In Eastern Canada, particularly in Ontario and Quebec, and to some extent in New Brunswick, there are still areas of land suitable for settlement, some of which will require a little development. But, nevertheless, conditions are such that the possibilities of making homes in northern Ontario, northern Quebec, and New Brunswick may be made attractive to those desirous to settle in a bush country or a country that is partially wooded. We are now in negotiation with the governments of these provinces, and have in mind the preparation of plans whereby the possibilities of settlement in these three eastern provinces may be brought before those looking for new homes in a country such as northern Ontario and Quebec. I have no doubt at all that if the plans for that work are carefully prepared and the necessary publicity work is carried out, a good many settlers can be induced to go into those regions in Eastern Canada. I think the hon member knows of quite a number of settlers who have gone into northern Quebec. I purpose to have a survey of the situation made this summer in order that we may know exactly the facts, and by consultation with the governments of Quebec and Ontario, and by necessary co-operation, we hope to be able to conduct a publicity campaign in Great Britain and the United States that will aid in the settlement and development of those portions of Eastern Canada to which I have referred. I have already had several interviews with members of the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Governments, and I trust that we shall be able to assist ** development of those provinces in the way of settlement.

The fact may not have been properly placed before them, but at any rate I can see no reason why British people should not be induced to settle in Northern Ontario or even in Northern Quebec. After all, when we look back in Canadian history we find that it was British stock that went out into the wilds in the early days, and there should be no reason whatever, if proper conditions were establlished, why people from the British Isles should not settle in certain portions of these provinces.

I have some knowledge of Western Canada and of land values there. I am afraid that if the minister's agents in the United States are telling people that they can buy land within a reasonable distance of a railway at $15 an acre they are

misleading them because there are very few places where you can buy land at $15, $20 or $25 an acre within any reasonable distance of a railway. Before the minister increases his expenditure upon immigration to any great extent he should try and make some provision whereby the land can be loosened from the grip of the speculators in Western Canada who are holding it for a rise in price, using the Immigration Department and the money of the people of Canada to bring in customers for that land, to the disadvantage not only of Canada but particularly of Western Canada. We have railways running through territory where the land is all held by speculators. We have national railways running through Canadian Pacific land. You cannot buy that land for anything like $15 per acre. Any that is within any reasonable, or farming, distance of a railway is being held at $25, $30, $40 and $45 per acre. The price and the cash payments are so high that it is almost impossible for a man with little means, say $2,500 or $3,000, to get upon that iand, even to get a quarter section, because the holders want a big cash payment and it takes a considerable amount of money to get stock and implements. I noticed in the press this morning that the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment Department have in the neighbourhood of 5,000 applications from soldiers for land and that something like 1,900 have been dealt with. If this land is so plentiful that we can afford to look for immigrants throughout the world, the soldiers should be able to get land more readily. If we have no land why are we spending money to get people to come in here to add to the number of unemployed and to go upon strike? If there is not enough work now for the people who are in the country, why should we be looking for other people to come in here and increase the difficulties that we have upon our hands? I am afraid that Parliament is living in a fool's paradise at the present time. I believe that the strike condition is very much worse than the Government consider it to be. We were told by the ministers that they were not in communication with Winnipeg and that the information they had about the strike came through newspaper reports. If that is the condition, instead of sitting here voting away money for immigration, we should be looking into the fundamental reasons for this unrest and particularly for the reason why we are not able to get people on the land and why they are flocking into the cities. I had expected that the Minister oi Immigration and Colonization, after more

than a year and a half at the head of this department, would have had some very definite ideas about immigration and colonization, I thought 'he would have evolved a plan, that he would have come to the House and told us that he did not think we could satisfactorily handle any more immigration for the present year, and that he had solved the land problem so that people could get on the land instead of being encouraged to flock into the cities working for less than a living wage, with the high cost of living outstripping their salaries and wages. If the minister does not get any more information than he has given us he is not spending this $1,500,000 of the people's money very intelligently.

It is rauher startling to find that this department is costing so much money. I took occasion last year to remind the minister that his department is merely a subdivision, something like the situation in which a farmer finds himself when he divides his hundred acres of land between his two sons; there might be enough for one but not enough for either when he divides his substance between them. For many years we found that this work was being attended to by one department, but when it became necessary to provide for the younger son, the patrimony was divided. This younger son, in the person of the Minister of Immigration, should realize that this department is not necessary at all. At all events, it was not found necessary until an extraordinary condition arose in this country. The minister should handle the affairs of the department with great care so that no person would have any reason to say that his administration was characterized by any degree of extravagance. But as has been pointed out by my hon. friend from Antigonish and Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair), the extraordinary condition exists that as the number of immigrants falls off the cost per capita ascends. That is a condition which should not exist and one for which the minister should give some satisfactory explanation. There is another phase of the new department which should receive attention and that is that the minister should have everything at his finger ends in connection with it. It is only about two years old. He started on the ground floor with everything new. He is the creator, the promoter, the advancer of his department and he has been with it from the beginning. He is not like a man who took charge of a big department after it had been growing for many years and from whom it might be unreasonable to expect a knowledge of all the various details. Here is a department that started into operation with himself at the head of it. He ought to know all about it. There should not be any underground workings in connection with it with which he was not familiar. I am more or less disappointed with the degree of familiarity and knowledge of his department that he displayed in connection with these items. I suppose the minister is a busy man, has a great many things to do and that he possibly did not anticipate the questions that would be asked, but I would expect more details and greater capacity to answer the various proper questions that have been submitted to the minister. The minister tells us that there are other items undeT which we would have wider scope to deal with the lands that we have in the West, but, now that he has entered upon the matter himself, I would say that when he comes down again he ought to tell us in a systematic way, dealing with every province by itself, how much land the Government has to be disposed of for settlement purposes, where these lands are, at what price, under what arrangements are they available for settlement, how far are they from railways in the various provinces and particularly the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. I do not understand that the Government has very much acreage in British Columbia, and possibly not a very large acreage in Ontario-in fact I do not know whether the Government possesses any land in that province. I also wish to state to the minister that I think there has been a very poor system followed in disposing of Government lands in the West. For that the minister is not at all responsible, but it is possibly not yet too late to establish a better system. I think that only certain areas of land should be set off for settlement, and until they have been disposed of and occupied, settlers should not be allowed to run away hundreds of miles from the railway by reason of a whim or fancy of their own, when the lands in those far-off districts are no better than those which are available closer to the railways. By establishing a system of that kind settlers would be located together, within range of a railway station, and we would not be called upon, as we are now, to build

a larger mileage of railways than constitutes a fair proportion per capita for the population which we serve in that country. I would suggest to the minister that he should carefully inquire into the way in which this land is disposed of, and that he will see to it in future that the allotment of the land is carried out on a proper basis having regard to the railway accommodation which row exists in the West. It would be far better in the interests of settlers themselves to follow out some such plan, because they could get their grain and other products more easily shipped. It would likewise be more satisfactory for the communities that are growing up, because they could have schools, religious services, and other facilities more easily provided when they are in settlements or villages. - This is a matter which I wish particularly to bring to the notice of the minister.
The minister has observed that we have large quantities of land in the West. I am glad to hear that such is the case, because my understanding was that the Government had been disappointed when it came to take an inventory of the Government lands that were available in connection with the settlement of soldiers on the land. I am informed-I cannot say whether this is official or not-that the Government discovered when looking for land to give to the soldiers, that it did not have nearly as much as it thought it had, and now finds it necessary to expropriate lands which companies have bought, or have received as railway subsidies, and which are being held possibly for speculative purposes. When the minister comes before the Committee again he may be able to tell us, if such comes within his department, what the policy of the Government is in respect of such lands. I would like him, in fact, to give a general idea of the policy of the Government as to the disposal of lands which it owns and which will be dealt with in connection with immigration purposes. There is, of course, a close alliance between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Immigration and Colonization, and I am not expecting the minister to answer questions regarding matter which more properly come within the purview of the former department.

Bales and J. W. Harrison, commissioners who were appointed to report on the pilotage districts of Miramichi, Sydney, Louisburg, Halifax, St. John, Montreal and Quebec. The report has been received by the department, laid on .the Table, .and distributed to members. I direct the minister's attention especially to the recommendations regarding the Miramichi district. I was very glad to hear the minister announce that he proposes to introduce a Bill to bring certain of our great national ports under his department to a greater extent than has been the case in the past. The recommendations of the commission regarding the Miramichi district are as follows:
That the condition of the pilotage in this district has been found to he exceptional and the earnings of the .pilots during the year 1917 have been exceedingly low, owing .to the falling off of deal shipments by water, from the ports in this distriot. That it is most urgent that something should be done whereby tihe individual earnings of these .pilots may be increased, and with this in view we strongly recommend that the number of' pilots be reduced so as not to exceed twelve, and to accomplish this aim will require the retirement of four of the oldest pilots, whose ages range from 71 to 74. The enforced retirement of these men your commissioners consider will entail a certain hardship as they are well preserved and still active. Having these conditions in mind we recommend that some compensation be made to these men annually, to a sum not exceeding $300, for the remainder of their lives; but this shall be understood not to extend to any pilots who may hereafter be retired in this district. This will be in lino with the precedent created by the Marine Department in the Quebec Pilotage district when reducing the number of pilots in that district a few years ago.

The next paragraph refers to the Admiral Beatty, the vessel that is used in connection with this work, and sets out the fact that recently one of the vessels was lost at sea, and hence is no longer available for the work. The concluding paragraph is as follows:
That an additional five per centum per annum be deducted from the gross earnings of the pilots of this district for the purpose of creating and maintaining a superannuation fund for the pilots retiring in the district.
The average income of the pilots, for six months or during open navigation is about $750 per man, but owing to war conditions in 1917 the net earnings of each pilot were reduced to the nominal sum of $150. It is no wonder the commissioners say that something should be done in this matter. The conditions are very exceptional, and I am glad that the minister is considering the case of Miramichi, which is one of the greatest waterways in Canada. I am sure that a large number of ocean vessels will load there this year, and from this year's operations I have no doubt the men will receive a fair remuneration. But the whole situation is very unsatisfactory. The evidence shows that only three or four of the pilots are below the age of 66. The majority are between 60 and 70, and three or four of them are over 70. It seems to me that it would be reasonable to retire men of that age and not allow them to be in charge of valuable property. The loss of one vessel would more than counterbalance any reasonable provision that might be made for these men, and I hope that when the minister is reconsidering the matter he will give his earnest and considerate attention to the claims of the pilots on the Miramichi river. I do not think he would go very far afield if he accepted the suggestion of the Commission, and granted a small amount, not to exceed $300, as compensation to these three men between the .ages of 71 and 74. I trust he will see his way clear to vote a certain sum as the nucleus of a pension fund to which the pilots could pay so much annually out of their earnings, so that in the future when a pilot reaches a certain age he can be superannuated.

These articles go out to the agricultural district representatives. I believe that in practically all cases they keep their files complete and the Gazette really becomes a sort of reference library to these workers. This undoubtedly has value.

record the case of a man who has not been given justice by the Board of Pension Commissioners and to get, if possible, the minister's assurance that he will take an interest in getting the Board to settle the case justly. I refer to the case of a private named John Taylor, whose regimental number was 439,640 and Pension Board Number 32,019. This man was wounded in France. He came home, and on the strength of having an injured arm-an arm that appeared to me to be paralyzed-he was given a pension of $5 a month. I met him quite by accident and I found that his right hand was absolutely paralyzed and his right arm out of use because of this paralysis-and he was receiving the magnificent sum of $5 a month. I took the matter up with the Board of Pensions Commissioners by wire on December 19th last, informing them that this man was getting $5 a month and that 1 considered it a disgrace to the country that he should be so treated. They wrote to me informing me that this man's hand was not paralyzed. They said:
On discharge it is found] that fingers could be moved passively through all the entire extent of normal movements and that the gTasp was lessened. There is no sign of injury to the nerves, and it was the report of the medical examiner at Port Arthur which stated1 that most of the condition was due to psychic disturbance, and not to any organic injury to nerves or muscles.
Further on they said:
The spasm of the muscles of the forearm and hand disappearing under an anaesthetic.
I communicated with them again in a letter dated December 27 objecting to their decision on the ground that even if this man's case was one of psychic paralysis, as they called it-that is, more or less imaginary-unless they cured that psychic paralysis the man had every right to a proper pension. I still adhere to that opinion. If a man loses the use of his arm through service at the front he deserves to be treated properly by his country-and this man has not been treated properly by the Board of Pensions Commissioners in
;:002

receiving an allowance of $5 a month when his right arm has been put out of business. Whether the disability is psychic or organic is beside the question, to my mind; unless the paralysis is cured the man has a right >to a pension. I also informed the Board that the fact that this man's fingers could be moved passively had nothing to do with the case, because to earn one's bread one had to move his fingers actively. I said further that the disappearance of the paralysis under an anaesthetic was also beside the question, as a man under an anaesthetic would find it difficult to earn a living.
I again wrote to the Board about this case and they claimed that Mr. Taylor was under treatment by the Invalided Soldiers' Commission. At the time they said he was being treated by that Commission he was working in Fort William-I admit that they were misinformed, through no fault of theirs. The most treatment the man had during the four months that he was supposed to be under the Invalided Soldiers' Commission was four days, but he received no pension during the (4) months that he was supposed to be under treatment. Later they paid him $20 for the four months. After working three months on this case, after many letters and other correspondence I succeeded in getting him re-boarded somewhere around March 5. He advised me to this effect, and he was then granted a 45 per cent pension, which would mean a pension of about $20 a month, which shows that a mistake was made in the first place when they gave him a pension of $5 a month. They were, however, not satisfied with that, and they sent him to Winnipeg to he boarded again, and the Winnipeg Board also recommended him for a 45 per cent pension, he tells me. He came back to Fort William about the middle of March, and he wrote me he was content to get this pension. But he waited another two months and after hearing no more about it he wrote to me again, and I once more drew their attention to this. They then advised him to go back to Winnipeg again for re-examination, and the man refused, and to my mind quite rightly. He had already been sent to Winnipeg twice and had been examined by neurologists in Winnipeg. Why, then, should it be necessary for this man to be put to the trouble of going to Winnipeg the third time with the possibility of losing his job? He was receiving a pension of only $5 a month and he was earning his living. Besides, this would mean putting the country to the expense of taking him all the way to Winnipeg a third time.

It was some time about the middle of May that he advised me he was not going to go to Winnipeg any more, as he had to earn his living. I advised him I thought he was perfectly justified in not going, and I advised the Pension Board to that effect, because I do not think that man has received justice from the board. In reply to my letter, they advised me that they were giving the matter consideration. This is a case which has not yet been settled, although it is almost six months since I first drew the attention of the Pension Board to it, and it is high time that the board woke up to the fact that this man is being treated with absolute injustice. He was recommended for a 'higher pension, but they have not yet given it.

We found this situation: Due to the commandeering order in the United States and the lack of control over the margin of profit in that country, the butter price had gone up, as I have stated, from 12 to 18 cents a pound, and it was fully that much higher in the United States than in Canada. One thing obviously resulted. The Canadian farmers found a market in the United States available and they found that they could get much higher prices there for milk and cream than they could get in Canada under the commandeering order. Of course, they naturally commenced to take advantage of this. Hon. members will appreciate that if this was permitted those farmers who were so situated in Canada that they could ship their milk and cream to the United States, would be in a position of great advantage over those other farmers who could not avail themselves of that facility. Moreover, the principal purpose for which this requisition order had been issued would be to a large degree defeated. We wanted to get butter to supply Great Britain but we wanted to do it with fairness to all the interests concerned. We did not want to do it in a way that would unduly enhance the price to the Canadian consumers and we wanted to deal fairly with the farmers who were producing it. The price was fixed at one and one and a half cents a pound higher than that which hitherto had been paid and an embargo restriction was imposed on the shipment of milk and cream to the United States. It was not imposed in the absolute sense that the hon. member for Huntingdon has suggested. Those farmers who had a market, or who had their regular customers in the United States were permitted to send out the same amount of milk and cream they had hitherto been sending in order that they might retain their connections for the period of this temporary disturbance. Consequently, they continued to enjoy that right during the whoto period of the embargo. Every farmer however who had not a market already established in the United States was prevented from sending his milk and cream out. That was retained in Canada for the purpose of producing butter for shipment -overseas. The quantity of butter that was manufactured in these factories during this period

amounted to something over 5,000,000
pounds.	[DOT]
The hon. member has alluded to the Dairy Produce Commission which was really the agent of the British Ministry of Food in purchasing dairy products in Canada. That commission had as its chairman, and its chief administrative officer, Mr. James Alexander of Montreal who is one of the oldest cheese dealers in the city.
I want to say-and I have very intimate knowledge of the facts-that Mr. Alexander gave freely and unstintedly his time and attention to the work that he had in hand.
I have had repeated evidence from the officials of the British Ministry of Food as to their satisfaction with the manner in which that work was carried on. In addition there were on that Dairy Produce Commission, Mr. Ruddick, the Dairy Commissioner of Canada, and there were also two representatives of the farmers, or milk producers, of Canada, Mr. James Donaldson, of Atwood, president of the Western Ontario Dairymen's Association, and Mr. Guerin, of Quebec. Every step in this whole proposal was considered fully by the members of the Dairy Produce Commission on which, as I have stated, there were two farmers representing the dairying interests in Canada. The commission were in entire agreement as to the policy that should be followed. It is a mistake to think that the milk and cream producers in Canada were not directly represented in that matter. They were directly represented by the two representatives of the Dairyman's associations. The Dairy Produce Commission has wound up its work. The importation of butter and dairy products into Great Britain has been decontrolled and is now back in the hands of private traders. I wish to say in conclusion that in my judgment-and I have a fair knowledge in connection with it-the Dairy Produce Commission has rendered excellent service not only to the British Ministry of Food but also to the producers of Canada.

I notice that on the former occasion it was stated that there was no discrimination so far as the salaries of the county court judges throughout the Dominion are concerned. That is true as regards the salaries of county court judges under that title, but I would like to ask the Acting Minister of Justice if it is not a fact that the judges in the province of Quebec who hold a similar position to the county court judges in the other provinces are not paid higher salaries? If I am not mistaken the Superior court judges in that province hold positions equivalent to those of county court judges in the other provinces, and are paid higher salaries than those County Court judges are. I also noticed that in the debate the other day the point was made that in the other provinces the salaries of the County Court judges are augmented by the provinces themselves. That, I think, is clear proof that the salaries are not considered adequate, and I think no member of the House would for a moment urge that a stipend of $3,000 a year is by any means suitable for a County Court judge under existing conditions. I believe that British Columbia is the only province, in the West at least, that does not add to the salaries given these judges by the Dominion Government. In considering what the salary ought to be it seems to me that the Dominion Government has nothing whatever to do with additions to judicial salaries which the provinces may make. In British Columbia up to some twenty years ago the salary was enhanced by the provincial government appointing each County Court judge a stipendary magistrate, which carried with it an additional $500. That system was done away with something like twenty years ago, and there is now only one judge in the province who receives that additional

salary. The change did not affect those judges who were acting as stipendary magistrates at the time, but was applied to those who have since been appointed.
I would strongly urge that' the question of an increase in salary for these judges be not only given consideration, but favourable consideration, by the Government.

When it was before us on a previous occasion I tried to make clear what my own views were on the subject, and I am not going to take up the time of the Committee by repeating them now. I do not know what the views of the minister may be as to the salary that should be paid to these judges, but in view of the fact that we are granting salaries of $6,000 and $7,000 to officials in the
Government service who are not doing any more important work than that which devolves upon the judges of the County Court, I would certainly suggest to the minister, if the suggestion is of any assistance to him, that the salaries of County Court judges should not be less than $5,000. The case of the judges in the province of British Columbia has been advanced, and in the representations on their behalf I absolutely concur. However, I have no special request to make for the judges of one province more than those of another; I think the County Court judges throughout the country should receive the same salary. I might say, though, that it has been brought to my notice that in the chief city of Manitoba, the province of the Acting Minister of Justice, the County Court judge only receives $3,000 a year, whereas in Halifax and St. John, and other large provincial centres, the County Court judges receive $3,500.
There is no reason why the leading Cbunty Court judge in the metropolitan city of Manitoba should get less than a County Court judge at Halifax or St. John. The minister will have in mind the leading County Court judge in Winnipeg. I am not acquainted with him and do not know his name, but no doubt the minister knows him well; I understand that he is a capable man and ranks favourably with those occupying similar positions in other leading cities of the Dominion.
1 submit that the Superior Court judges in all the provinces should receive the same salary. In Nova Scotia, for instance, the Superior Court judges do not get the same salary as judges performing similar duties in Quebec and Ontario. I shall not take the comparison further west; but these judges are all in the same class; they administer the same laws and exercise the same jurisdiction, and their salaries should be uniform,. The minister pointed out the other day that the difference between the salaries of some of the judges in New Brunswick and Manitoba was due to the fact that, some of them were judges of the Court of Appeal. That does not apply to Nova Scotia, because our Circuit Court judges are judges of Appeal. The province has elected that for all time the judges of the Circuit Court shall be also judges of the Court of Appeal, and as these judges are satisfactorily doing the work of both courts, tney should receive the same salary as the Superior Court judges in other provinces. It would bring about good feeling and harmony in all the courts if judges performing similar

duties throughout Canada were all treated alike.

Until twenty years ago the senior County Court judges received $2,600 a year and the junior judges $2,000 a year. That remuneration was, perhaps, good enough for the time when people were not so luxurious and so extravagant as they are now and when the incomes of merchants and millers and other people generally wtere low. But as the incomes of the townspeople increased it was felt that the judges should be put on a par with the persons whom they would meet in a business way, socially, or otherwise. It was not deemed proper that the judge, who had the affairs of the people in his hands for adjudication, should be thought to be a man living from hand to mouth. He should be an independent person and be able to take his place socially or any other way with the best people in the community-Accordingly, about twenty years ago the salaries were raised to $3,000. But the purchasing power of a dollar is only half what it Was, and, following out. the principle upon which this remuneration was fixed years ago, we must surely increase it so that it will meet the condition brought, about by the decreased purchasing power of the dollar. I am glad that the minister received such a definite reply to his suggestion from Ontario. At the recent session of the Ontario Legislature they took away all the junior judges-whose remuneration has been $3,000, the same as the-senior judges-except in two countries, York and Wentworth, where the judges have a great deal to do. Twenty-eight junior judgeships are done away with and the positions will not be filled; but when senior judgeships become vacant the positions will be filled from these junior judgeships. This will result in a very large-saving in a few years-probably from $50,000 to $80,000. That sum might well be distributed among the seniors who are left in the different counties. A county court judge cannot at present keep up the social position which the people expect him to-keep up, nor educate his family properly,.

nor buy the necessary books to keep up with the literary and social events of the day, unless he has a salary o-f at least $5,000 a year, and I sincerely trust the Government will come to the conclusion that the remuneration of judges should not be less than that sum.

It was stated that the judges who had to do the work lived so far away from where the court sat that it was difficult for them to get there, and when they got there, they were 'in a hurry to return to their own district, and that the administration of justice was suffering very much in those sections.

He pointed out that Superior Court judges in Quebec received $5,000 while county court judges in other provinces received $3,000. There is, however, a difference in jurisdiction, but there is in Quebec really no bench corresponding in jurisdiction and certainly no bench corresponding in salary with the county, or district court bench, as it may be called, of the other provinces. I have not progressed with the subject far enough to say that I have reached any intention at all. The whole subject has to be considered as one-a Dominion wide subject.
Referring to the observations of the hon. member for Parkdale (Mr. Mowat) as to the opinion of the Bar of Canada, I have received from members of the Bar and from Bar associations, resolutions large in number and influential in signatures, all in favour of a substantial increase to judges. That body of opinion has left no doubt in the mind of the department as to what it considers should be done.

That being the case, it logically follows that when the struggle for existence becomes more intense the pay should increase, and that applies to every branch of industry, to the workingman and the professional man. If this is not done, we must have unrest even among the judges; if the unrest becomes acute it becomes a riot; if it becomes more acute still and the struggle more intense, it becomes a revolution. We must surely expect to observe the common logic of facts. If pay, therefore, is a reasonable recompense the pay must be increased as the struggle for existence becomes more intense.

I trust that some of the Quebec judges-1 do not know about judges in the other provinces-will see their way clear towards rendering judgment within say three or four years after a case has been placed before them for decision. This is a matter which ought to engage the attention of the Department of Justice. The delays in the matter of handing down judgments have almost approached a scandal. I confess that

when I see the judgments over which some judges have been spending so much time, I am mystified as to the long delays. Within the last few years there have been made to the bench appointments of several men who probably consider that they have been placed there simply as pensioners, because little is ever done by these gentlemen to see that speedy judgments are handed down. I speak about this matter advisedly, and while probably I am somewhat out of order, I hope that bringing this matter to the attention of the Committee will make some of these judges understand that they are, after all, servants of the public, as other people in the Civil Service are, and that they must do their duty as other employees in the Government service do.

A judge, besides receiving a salary while on the bench, can, after a certain number of years, get a retiring allowance. After fifteen years, he can retire on an allowance equal to two-thirds of his salary, and after twenty or twenty-five years, on an allowance equal to his salary. If one looks through the judges' accounts, one will find that there are in this country quite a few retired judges receiving large retiring allowances, some $8,000, some $7,000 and some less. There is a provision in the law that if a judge, through physical disability becomes incapable of discharging the duties of his office he is entitled to receive a liberal allowance, amounting in some cases to two-thirds of his salary and at least to one-half. We must also take into consideration the fact that judges are not liable for income tax, while members of other professions are. Therefore, the Acting Minister of Justice should take these things into consideration when he receives recommendations to increase judges' salaries. The cost of living to-day is so high that everybody is asking for an increase in salary, but there would be no necessity for increasing salaries if the Government took measures to lower the cost of living. Some of the civil servants have been granted an increase in salary; too much, I think. The Government has appointed a commission to re-classify the Service, and should have awaited their report before raising the salaries of the deputy ministers, because if the report finds their salaries too high the Government would find it rather difficult to decrease them. I hope that the Committee which has been appointed to inquire

into the cost of living will bring about a reduction in the cost of living, and if that is the result the salaries which we have paid to the judges since 1905 would then be sufficient, and the country would save the large amount involved in this proposed increase.

CRERAR (Minister of Agriculture) :,Minister of Agriculture,SUPPLY.,,,"I have never been any good at casting horoscopes, and I do not care to venture into that field now. The question raised by the hon. leader of the Opposition is, of course, an important one, but I cannot give, with any degree of accuracy, the number of people that have left the farms in Canada during the past year, or the number of those who have taken up farming. At present there is some difficulty in certain parts of Canada in securing an adequate supply of farm labour. This, I think, is due perhaps to the natural unrest that has ensued from the trying experiences through which the country has passed during the last four years. Generally speaking, agriculturaTconditions throughout Canada are good at the present time. A brief survey of agricultural results for the past year shows that in the Western Provinces the crop has suffered from drought and frost. However, with the abundant optimism characteristic of the Prairie Provinces, the farmers have settled down to work, and according to the most reliable information I have been able to obtain, there has been planted this year a larger acreage in cereals than was the case even last year, and I am very happy to say that the crops in Western Canada this spring have been planted in better condition than for several years past. We had an abundance of moisture practically all over the Prairie Provinces, and the prospects at the time of seeding and immediately after were excellent. Of course, our final crop returns will depend almost entirely on weather conditions during June and July. There is not such a fortunate condition of affairs in Ontario. There has been a great deal of rain in this province, and there have been difficulties in getting seeding completed, so that on the whole the situation is somewhat backward. However, it is not too much to hope that we may have good returns from Ontario and Quebec. Conditions in the Maritime Provinces are very good as far as we can gather.

I might perhaps, at the risk of wearying the Committee a little bit, give some more information on that subject. The fact is patent that almost all of our agricultural produce has its price fixed in
the outside markets of the world. There is scarcely any agricultural products produced in Canada that we are not exporting to some extent. I find that the total value of these exports for the year ended March 31, 1919 was almost $400,000,000. I quite believe that that amount iB capable of great expansion. Unfortunately, there are many districts in Canada where there is a lack of appreciation on the part of the farmers of the value of management in their business and of quality in their production. We enjoy to-day, for instance, in the markets of Great Britain the first position in so far as our bacon exports are concerned.

That is due to the type of bacon hog that is produced in Canada. We also have the premier position in Great Britain with respect to our cheese industry, the foundation of which was laid many years ago by Dr. Robertson who has done much excellent work for agriculture in Canada.
I have endeavoured on all occasions to impress upon Canadian farmers the importance of quality in their production. Particularly is there need for that in regard to the quality of the beef that we export to the European market. I was surprised to learn from the representatives of the British Ministry of Food that Canadian beef was regarded as inferior to the article imported from Argentina and the United States. We have had within the past year, several conferences with representatives of the Canadian breeders and live stock men's associations. This problem with others has been discussed with them and we have taken every possible means to impress upon, and to bring home to them, the importance of this .matter, and I think this has resulted in a quickened interest in it.
There is no reason why Canada, having in mind its geographical location, should not attain a very high place indeed in agriculture. We are closer to the European markets, and especially the great consuming market of the United Kingdom, than any other country outside of Europe, and the trade routes by which our produce reaches those markets traverse the temperate zone. When one considers that a vessel can make three trips from Canada to Liverpool in the time required for one trip from Melbourne to Liverpool, and two trips from Canada to Liverpool in the time consumed by a trip from Buenos Aires to Liverpool, our advantage in that respect is readily seen.

There is, at the present time, every evidence that the industrial expansion and development in the United States will be in a greater ratio hereafter than its agricultural development; and respecting some agricultural products it would appear that already the United States is approaching the position of being an importing country. When that time comes Canada will occupy a splendid position in respect of these markets; and I think that in the United States in the next twenty-five years -indeed even in the next ten years-we will see a great consuming market growing up for such of our agricultural products as cheese, butter, milk, honey, and meat of various kinds, and also cereals.

Let us return to the animal itself. With reference to the embargo in Great Britain on Canadian cattle, I notice that some papers in the United Kingdom are referring to it occasionally and are asking the British authorities to lift that embargo, which has been a sort of a stigma against Canadian cattle. My hon. friend probably knows the merits of the question better than I do. He knows that for years the British authorities have ordered our cattle to be slaughtered at the landing ports in the United Kingdom, practically at Liverpool, under the pretext that they were diseased and suffering from pleuro-pneumonia. It has been established beyond a doubt, however, that our cattle are absolutely free from that disease, and if my hon. friend wants the best available evidence on the subject, I might refer him to the testimony of the late Sir Charles Tupper. I must say to the credit of the old Conservative chieftain that while he was our High Commissioner in London he waged a bonny fight for Canada on that question. He states in his memoirs how on several occasions he approached the Board of Trade in England in order to have the embargo removed, and he offered to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the excuse given by the British authorities for the exclusion of Canadian cattle was in the nature of a very flimsy pretext. Being a medical man himself who, in his day, was renowned as a practitioner, he even went so far as to present himself at the abattoirs in Liverpool where, removing his coat and rolling up his shirt sleeves, his hands dripping with the blood of the animal, he made tests which proved beyond

contradiction that the excuse given by the British authorities for the embargo was no excuse at all. However, nothing was done to meet the wishes of Canada, and the agitation for the lifting of the embargo went on for years. Finally the question was brought up when the Imperial Conferences began to be held, and I have noticed that the question was raised on the occasion of each of these .conferences in London. It was brought up first by Sir Charles Tupper, then by the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and finally, if I mistake not, by the present Prime Minister. It appears that a few months ago the enforcement of the embargo was a lively question in the Old Country, and my attention has been directed to the fact that certain of the press of the United Kingdom are now asking the British authorities to lift it. Were any steps taken during the Prime Minister's stay in London with a view to carrying out this policy, which appeals to every true Canadian and to every cattle-raiser in Canada?

I am not thoroughly familiar with the steps that were taken, but I do know that at the Imperial Conference in 1917 the matter was brought up, and it was brought up again last year. Dr. Robertson went overseas last June in a representative capacity for the Department of Agriculture to look into the food situation and to gather what inforrnation he could as to future food prospects generally and as to how Canada could best co-operate in assisting the Allies. I asked him at that time to assist the Prime Minister who was then in Great Britain, to bring this matter in the proper way before the British authorities. That was done. Dr. Robertson again went

over with the Prime Minister when he left Canada last year to attend the Peace Conference. We had gathered all the data and information that we could in Canada bearing upon the matter, and he has been active in taking the matter up with the British authorities since that time. In February we sent to Great Britain the Live Stock Commissioner for Canada to supply any additional information that might be required. Various breeders were interviewed and everything possible was done to remove the misconception existing in the minds of many British stockmen with regard to the probability of this disease or any other disease coming from Canada. I think we were able to convince them that Canada, has a clean bill of health in regard to her live stock. I venture the assertion that there is no country in the world which guards the health of animals more carefully than Canada does. The matter is at present under consideration. All I can say is that we are hopeful that something will be done and that these markets may be opened up to us, at least in some degree, ot as they were prior to the imposition of the embargo.

keeping in touch with the minister and his work during the year and 1 find that we have the right man in the right place. There is every reason to say that he has been doing good work.

The officials at that experimental farm station give instructions upon the cultivation of com, grain and potatoes and information with regard to different kinds of soil, and so on. It is a great benefit to the county, and I wish the minister would do even a little more in the way of improving it. The farm is easy of access-a good gravel road leads to it-but we are wanting a little in equipment; we want better tools and machinery. A farm needs a lot of machinery; it is about as easy to equip a mill as it is to equip a farm with the right machinery. A great deal of the unrest that prevails in this country is due to the fact that not enough of us are on the farm. The farm will have to be made more attractive; the work will have to be made a little easier. With the assistance of the Government a

great deal can be done in a few years along this line. The present minister has had two or three years' experience; he is still a young man, and I would be sorry to see [DOT]him drop out. I hope that the reports in [DOT]the press that he is about to resign are not true. Although we differ in politics, yet I can say that he is doing his best for the farming interests of the country. The farmers have never been attended to as they should be. This country has been throwing bouquets in .the way of titles to exploiters, the railroad men, the financiers. It, is true that some dropped on good soil, but some certainly dropped on stony ground. I have yet to hear of the farmer who received a title, although many farmers have richly earned them. Farmers have spent half a lifetime in securing the best seed wheat that could be produced [DOT]and sending it among the farmers, thus assisting in the raising of enormous crops in three western provinces. In this part of the country men have spent a lifetime perfecting stock-horses, cattle, cows, pigs, sheep, and everything that belongs to the farm; yet I do not see that the Government has thrown titles on any of their shoulders. I am sorry that titles are cut out, so far as that goes, because I would like to see some conferred upon the farmers.

In .my judgment, the high cost of produce is the principal cause of strikes in this country, because a man's salary will not buy suitable clothes, provisions and food for himself and his family. We must, therefore, reduce the price of provisions, and the only way to do that is for more of us to go on, the land, to cultivate the soil and to produce. We have in Canada one of the greatest countries the sun shines on and we may be proud of the country we inherit. We have in Canada sufficient land for a hundred million people. I have been informed that in the Peace river district there is room for thousands upon thousands of people, and that one can find there the very best of farming land. Settlers can go into that district for the

next fifty years and yet there will be room. It is a district that is not nearly as cold as Manitoba or some of the other western provinces. We should cut out politics and get to farming, as it is the only thing that is going to save this country.

It was to me, personally, a source of much satisfaction that I was able to prevail on Dr. Grisdale to accept this position. I think he knows agriculture generally throughout Canada better than any other man-at all events better than any other man I have met.
With regard to the policy of the department in making appointments, we are following wherever possible the principle oi promotion within the department rather than going outside for officials. I think that principle is sound in every respect and encourages those within the department, no matter what their position may be, to put forth their best efforts.
The hon. member for Argenteuil (Mr. McGibbon) dwelt on the importance of experimental farms as a means of agricultural education. I quite agree that the experimental and demonstration farms are one of the best means of bringing home to

our farmers the advantages of better methods of cultivation and production generally. It must be borne in mind, however, that these farms, as their names imply, are largely experimental. We have in Canada to-day, outside of the Central Experimental Farm at Ottawa, 20 experimental farms and stations, 3 tobacco stations, 7 sub-experimental farms or substations as we call them, and 44 illustration farms. I look to the development of the illustration farm as perhaps the best means of bringing within the reach of the average farmer a knowledge of better methods of cultivation and general improvement in agricultural methods. These illustration farms are worked on the -following plan. A district is Selected and examined, and one of the best -farmers of the district who is willing to undertake the work is asked to associate himself with the work of the experimental farms. A certain plot o-f -his land is set apart, and he cultivates this plot under the direction and supervision of the representative of the department, who visits him at stated periods. In Western Canada last fall, in- the drought-stricken area, we had one or two striking illustrations of the value of this work, particularly as to the effect of proper soil cultivation on the retention of moisture in the soil, with consequent greater production. That work is being actively carried on. The purely experimental farm is, of course, of great value, but the illustration- farm can at a small -expense be brought within the reach of almost every farmer.
There is another point, and a very important one. It is a conclusion I have reached as the result of my experience in the department and of the study I have been able to -give the subject generally. There is expended in Canada through the Federal and Provincial Departments of Agriculture approximately $7,500,000 annually. I am convinced that from the national point of view -we are not getting the results from that expenditure that might be secured. In my judgment, there should be closer co-operation and better co-ordination between the federal and provincial activities. I found on making inquiries that in many cases federal and provincial activities were overlapping-that both federal and provincial departments were in- certain cases carrying on the same line of work. Now that is a waste of effort, and I might add also, a waste of money. At this particular time, when our national expenditure is mounting very rapidly, and we shall have to face in the future heavy taxation

and probably difficulties in raising the necessary revenue it is of the greatest importance, not only in the field of -agriculture, hut in every other field, that -there -should be the closest co-operation and coordination between federal and provincial activities. I have already mentioned this matter to a few provincial ministers of agriculture, and they were quite sympathetic to the idea. This is an important matter, and I -hope it will be more fully inquired into during this year.

Coming from New Brunswick, a province in whidh there are the two races and languages, I may say that the reputation of the minister is as high there as it is in Quebec. During the last few years the farmers of New Brunswick have taken new heart in their industry and have doubled their production. The deputy minister is also well known in the district from which I come, to the French Acadians as well as to the Scotch, Irish and English, and I am sure the new appointment meets with their approval and good wishes, and that it will encourage the farming community in that section of Canada.
Some years ago, just before the Liberal party went out of power, I had been in hopes of having an experimental farm established at Petit Rocher which would be a central part for all the people of northern New Brunswick, from the Matapedia district to the Miramichi.
We have along these ehores shipping facilities, wharfs, breakwaters and harbours by which steamer communication would be established with the other side of Bay des Chaleurs. Besides railway connections there
is in that portion of the country the best and most improved highway in the province and one that is second to none in Canada. An experimental farm of modest dimensions could be established to start with, and I am sure it could be very rapidly extended.
I would ask the Minister of Agriculture to take note of my remarks and to see during the recess, whether it be short or long, what he can do in the matter in the interest of the farmers of northern 'New Brunswick. Farming is the basic industry of this country. In the early days of the session, I brought to the attention of the Government the necessity of readjusting the tariff so as to encourage the farming community before seeding commenced.
If that had been done, the labour situation would have been bettered and there would not be the unrest there is throughout the country to-day. To-day, again, I urge the Minister of Agriculture to take my remarks into consideration. He knows that I am with him in his desire to advance the interests of the farming industry, not only in the West but in the East as well.
I can assure him that the farmers of the East are in harmony with the farmers of the West in their aspirations and in their economic views, and there is no danger of a cleavage between the people of the East and the people of the West. The only place in Canada where there is a cleavage is in Central Canada, where the unrest prevails to-day. We hope before long that unrest will be settled.

If it did not get across it was probably due to the fact that they were obliged to keep some at home to cope with the rapid increase in prices as a result of commandeering. In Canada, under the regulations of the Food Board, limitations of price in butter was not fixed, but the margins of profit that could be taken by dealers in butter, whether cold storage, merchants or others, were fixed definitely by regulations under the Food Board.
These dealers were obliged to produce evidence that they were selling their butter within the margin of profit that had been allowed. In devising a method of meeting' the request of the British Food Ministry for supplies of butter the Canadian Food Board were faced with the problem of trying to secure that butter without abnormally increasing the price in Canada. The price of the butter in cold storage and in wholesale dealers' hands was already limited in this respect, that the margin of profit on it was limited, and since the butter had already gone into their hands at prices prevailing when they purchased, the selling price was practically established.
I want to assure the Committee, and particularly the hon. member for Chateauguay-Huntingdon, that this question was most carefully considered by myself, by the expert officials in the department and also by the Dairy Produce Commission., of whom I shall have a word to say in a moment. After we had gathered all the facts that were available we reached the conclusion that the better method in Canada would be to commandeer the production of butter from the factories in Canada for a stated period. An order was issued to that effect. The period covered five weeks' production. The price was fixed at Montreal, if my memory serves me, a.t a cent or a cent and a half a pound over what the Dairy Produce Commission had been paying theretofore.

I wish to allude to a point mentioned by the hon. member for Chateauguay-Hunting-don (Mr. Robb), and that is the charge that private dealers in Montreal had benefited by virtue of having inside information before the commandeering order was made public.

I may be mistaken in that regard, but I do not think I am.
With regard to the importation of New Zealand butter into Canada. This butter has for years been coming into the Dominion. Owing to the lack of tonnage available from New Zealand to Great Britain, large surpluses of butter have accumulated in the former country, and the vessels that occasionally traded between British Columbia and the Australian Dominions carried the commodity. To-day New Zealand butter is being laid down in British Columbia at a cheaper rate than it can be produced in the Prairie Provinces, and I expect that condition will continue for some time to come. It is a case of having a large surplus in a country that has been unable to find its usual market, and the expansion of our own dairy trade not being what we might otherwise have expected.

Many men in Canada have received knighthoods who do not deserve them as much as Mr. Wheeler, on his humble farm in Saskatchewan. His services have been a real benefit to the public. No man can make two blades of grass grow where formerly there was only one without doing a great benefit to his country. I have personal knowledge of this man's work. He came to Canada
from England in 1885, arriving at Moosejaw in the midst of those trying years when most people were discouraged from farming in Western Canada. From 1883 to 1887 there were almost continuous crop failures owing to the fact that, without irrigation, there was not enough moisture to produce vegetation. Wheeler, who was a young boy at the time, showed his interest in agriculture by first cultivating a garden in low-lying ground along a creek that ran through the town of Moosejaw. He carried the necessary water in a bucket and had a beautiful garden growing while no one else in the town was making any attempt to produce vegetables. He afterwards moved to the north country, and I have read you the result of his efforts along the line of the improvement of cereals. The least the Government could do is recognize this man's efforts by assisting him in some way, even if only to the extent of a grant of $1,000 or $1,500 a year, to put him beyond worry so far as his living is concerned and to enable him to devote all his thought and energy to the work in which he is specially interested and for which he is particularly well fitted, the development of our cereals. I strongly recommend that the minister give this matter his careful consideration.

Are there any objections or obstacles to the use of these drouth-resisting varieties in that district?

This proposal that hi9 work should be recognized by the Federal Department of Agriculture was placed before me many months ago, and I gave considerable thought to it. There is, of course, one difficulty. In matters of Government, precedents are always dangerous to establish, and while I fully recognize the value of the work Mr. Wheeler has done, I have not been able up to the present to convince, myself that that recog-

nition should come from the Federal Department. Without in any way desiring to throw the responsibility elsewhere, I consider this a matter in which the Provincial Government might, to better advantage, give the recognition. In the realm of agriculture there are certain things that should be done by provincial department? of agriculture and certain other things that fall more naturally into the federal field Mr. Seager Wheeler has rendered excellent service to the grain growers of Western Canada; indeed, I know of no other individual farmer who has done more.
I should like to refer also to the remarks of the hon. member for Dufferin (Mr. Best) as regards the advisability and, indeed the necessity, of providing elevator facilities in Ontario. That is a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Commerce, which has charge of grain elevators. Some time ago quite a representative delegation waited on the Acting Minister of Trade and Commerce (Hon. A. K. Maclean) and urged upon him the advisability of building at once at some suitably located point in Ontario an elevator that would serve the purposes and needs set out by the hon. member for Dufferin. I believe the matter is now under the consideration of that department. I am not certain, but I think the Board of Grain Commissioners have been asked to make some report upon the advisability and utility of the proposal.

In New Brunswick some years ago the production of wheat was almost nil, until the Provincial Government took the matter in hand and assisted the farmers by 'bonusing small grist mills and distributing wheat seed. The province had practically abandoned the growing of wheat because of the lack of mills to grind it, but now the Provincial Government bonuses any one who will build a mill, and the result is that the production of wheat has increased by 300 to 400 per cent. The imills are doing very well, but there are not enough of them throughout the province. The bonus granted by the Provincial Government is not large enough, and I would therefore suggest that the Dominion Government join hands with the Provincial Government in encouraging the building of mills. In the county where I live you can go for fifty miles without seeing.a grist mill. That condition practically prohibits the raising of wheat, and the farmers might just as well take up some other work. I know a party in my own county who is willing to build a mill but has not the means, in view of the high cost of labour and materials. If the Government would bonus those who erect grist mills for grinding and cleaning the wheat, it would certainly encourage production and be of great advantage to the farmers. It is very necessary that the farmers should have clean wheat seed.

Some years ago I brought down and laid on the table of the House a sample of our Yukon wheat, and it created considerable interest. Afterwards I sent it to the seed analyst at the Experimental Station here, and he planted one hundred grains taken at random out of the sack. He was surprised, and I was delighted, to find that every one of those grains germinated, showing the vitality of the wheat we grow in the Yukon. There is a small agricultural station at Dawson, and my suggestion is that the minister select different types of wheat and have them grown there, to see if we cannot grow a type of wheat in the Yukon which will require a shorter season than any wheat grown in Saskatchewan, Alberta or Manitoba. I make that suggestion because I think there are some potentialities. We have so much sunlight in the Yukon in the summer that grain grows very rapidly, and the number of growing days would consequently be less than on the prairiesi.

I believe that if we had had an experimental farm there a good deal of expense could have been saved in connection with seed which we have been compelled for two seasons to send to that district to help the farmers. Last year the Government for this purpose withdrew a section of land that was put on the market for sale, and I would like the minister to consider the advisability of making a start in that section of the country in establishing an experimental farm.

Does that imply that the department has to do with cold storage cars, for instance? Does the department furnish cold storage for the transportation of fish and other perishable products which are carried from one place to another?
This matter is of the greatest importance The fishermen along the coasts of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island complain that while there are cold storage cars they are very poorly equipped and a very large percentage of fish and other products put into cold storage become unfit for human food before they reach their destination. It is necessary that fish should be kept cool and well iced from one stage of transportation to another until it is finally disposed. It has been complained that this matter is not attended to, and that the ice which is provided when the food leaves the point of shipment melts and is not renewed, the fish being destroyed. If this item is intended to cover [DOT]that particular phase of transportation and bring it within the scope of the Department of Agriculture, I would seriously press upon the minister the necessity of having the most complete system that can possibly be devised. Attention should be given not only to what forces itself upon the department, but every encouragement should he given to see that proper care is exercised in transportation with a view to obtaining the best and most profitable results. I have always thought-and I have brought the matter to the attention of the Govern-

ment several times-that in addition to provision for the proper care of food on transit in cars, there should be a suitable place of reception for the cars themselves when they reach their destination, some sort of cold storage shed where the car might be kept free from contamination until the freight is finally unloaded. These cars, I understand, are sometimes allowed to stand in the yard uncared for and in many cases valuable food such as fish decays and becomes unfit for consumption, and has to he thrown away. I am not quite sure that this comes within the purview of the Department of Agriculture, but the item seems to suggest that it does. If it does, I cannot too strongly urge upon the minister, and in any event upon the department which may deal with the matter, the great importance of this phase of the transportation question.

transportation of dairy products and fruits; it does not include fish, which is covered by an item in the Marine and Fisheries Department. Assistance is given to promote, and also by way of investigation to ascertain, the advantages to the producer from the use of proper refrigeration service in the transportation of these perishable commodities. I quite agree with the leader of the Opposition that the matter is one of very great importance. The advantage of cold storage and proper refrigeration, not only in rail bui in ocean transportation, has not, I venture to say, been fully recognized by the producers and the people generally. To assist in this work the Government, as has already been stated in the House on previous occasions, have made provision for the erection of a public cold storage plant on the harbour front of Montreal under the control of the Board of Harbour Commissioners for that port. Thi9 is to accomplish the very purpose which the leader of the Opposition refers to, namely, that commodities may have a suitable place of storage pending their further shipment. A portion of this grant is used for cow testing in the ordinary dairy herds. We have a staff of inspectors, and farmers are encouraged to test the milk production of their various animals. Very remarkable results have been obtained, and many farmers are weeding out unprofitable animals. There is also provision for cargo inspection in the shipment of perishable commodities overseas. There is a cargo inspection not only at the port of landing but also in the United Kingdom. Self-registering thermometers are used in the storage
compartments of the vessels, and complete records of temperatures are taken on the way across, which records are preserved in the files of the department. Further, there is some small provision for the drafting of plans of suitable dairy buildings. Very often inquiries are received from creameries and cheese factories and persons interested in the dairy business for suggestions as to suitable buildings to meet their requirements, and we are endeavouring to provide-for these necessities'. These are the matters that are mainly covered by the items included under this head. The development of our dairying industry in Canada is of. great importance. Great Britain imports about 500,000,000 pounds of butter annually and Canada supplies a very small portion of that, not more than a few million pounds. Britain's annual imports in eggs are also enormous, but Canada supplies only a few millions of dozens. In order to take full advantage of that market and to hold it we have to do two or three important things. First, we must secure the bost possible standard of quality in our product, and in the various activities of the department we are endeavouring to impress that fact on producers. Second,-and this is of equal importance-there must be proper facilities for shipment. If you ship a carload of butter from Montreal, Halifax or any other port and leave it standing on the wharf for a day or two in hot weather, deterioration sets in and the original quality of the butter can never be restored. Therefore, proper cold storage facilities and proper refrigeration service on vessels are of the greatest importance. The business of this branch generally is to study that field, and by experiment, investigation and inquiry, to discover the best possible methods that can be used to achieve these results.
Mr. McKENZIiE: Have we succeeded in Canada in obtaining a perfectly safe refrigerator car for the transportation of perishable food such as butter or fruit? The difficulty has been that although we have been reputed to have refrigerator cars suitable for the carrying of such goods, the cals used have been altogether inadequate, and great losses have been incurred by the use of them. Is there any experiment or improvement in this matter? Are we advancing any nearer the goal of our ambition to have a perfectly good refrigerator car?

Mr. LBGE'R: I would favour the idea of a Government-owned cold storage plant in the Maritime Provinces. With that I would urge the Government to have a good inspector to visit it frequently. If I am well informed, there are throughout Canada many cold storage warehouses, full of foodstuffs w.hich are held for higher prices. These cold storage warehouses should be visited by Government inspectors and the foodstuffs should be sold instead of being kept there to enhance prices. In that way the poor people of Canada would be benefited. These trusts or combines get together and fill up these warehouses with foodstuffs which they hold until the price goes up. As was said by an hon. member, a large quantity of foodstuffs was wasted in Montreal toy being held in cold storage for higher prices. The cost of living is getting so high that it is almost impossible for the poor people to live, and the Government should take steps to cause cold storage warenouses to -be emptied at a certain time of the year instead of being kept full of foodstuffs the year round, thus keeping the price up.

I understand the Department of Agriculture for Nova Scotia has been impressing upon the minister that some steps should be taken to erect at Halifax a cold storage plant somewhat similar to the one it is proposed to erect at Montreal. I have nothing to say against the building of a plant at Montreal,

but I was told that- one of the reasons why this cold storage plant was 'being erected at Montreal was to furnish facilities for the shipment of -chilled or other beef at all seasons of the year. The minister knows well that .shipping facilities at the port of Montreal are limited in season. For a considerable portion of the year that port is frozen up and vessels cannot come to or go away from it. Navigation is open in the harbour of Halifax 365 days of the year every year, and I am sure the same thing may be said of St. John, although not to the same easy extent as at Halifax. I do not know if there are any hon. members from New Brunswick here -who may criticise me if I say anything about the high tide difficulties of the St. John harbour. It is, however, open all the year round and ships can come to and go from it. If the Government have decided that it is proper to spend $1,000,000 for the purpose of erecting a cold storage plant to be auxiliary to transhipment across the Atlantic, that plant should be at a place which shipping can go to and depart from at all seasons. That is, I think, a strong argument in favour of such facilities being erected at the ports of Halifax and St. John, or, if not at both, at least at one of them. In- view of the fact that the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture -has put in its claim-and I have not heard that any particular claim was sent in from New Brunswick, although the one would require it just as much as the other-the minister should give some attention to the very legitimate request put forward. I understand the hon. member for Victoria city who has brought this matter to the attention of the minister is the president of a -certain association that has to deal with agricultural matters throughout the province.

I should like to point out to the minister an extraordinary thing that happened in Nova Scotia last year. The farmers in several counties such <as Pictou and Antigonish, the latter being exclusively a farming community, -are excellent farmers. They discovered that the hay crop was not up to standard last

year, and tliey were obliged to sell off hundreds of their live stock. They sold them to a gentleman who could do nothing with them but take them to a place where they could be slaughtered and put into cold storage. As there was no cold storage warehouse in the Maritime Provinces, those cattle were carried alive to Montreal or Toronto, slaughtered and the meat kept in cold storage all winter. The beef was then shipped back over nearly 1,500 miles of railroad to Nova Scotia and sold to our miners, lumbermen and other people. The minister can readily understand the enormous increase that must necessarily be put upon the first cost of that article on account of its being handled in that manner.

those interested in the cattle trade are quite ready to build abattoirs if cold storage facilities were provided, but it is too expensive for them to erect a cold storage plant, and they are, therefore, looking to the Government to do so. It would be a good investment and a good policy for the Government to build such a plant. Does the minister intend in connection with the cold storage plant at Montreal, to provide a place where a car could be run in?
In order to do that, the lower story of the building would have to be made something like a railway yard. If that could be provided, it would certainly save a great deal of handling and re-handling of the contents. It might be that these facilities would be made use of only once in a while, but they would certainly 'be a splendid thing to have.

Friday is the big fish day in cities, and Thursday or early Friday morning is the best time to sell a car of fish in Montreal or Toronto. If the car happens to get there on Monday or Tuesday and has to stand in the yard during the early part of the week, when there is not so much demand for fish, my information is, the fish deteriorates and becomes unfit for sale, often resulting in a total loss. If there was a place in the cold storage building into which a car could be run and kept until its contents were disposed of, the shippers would feel secure against waste, and it would be a great encouragement to them. If this can be brought about, and the plans are not too far advanced, I would certainly suggest that limited accommodation, at all events, of
this character should be supplied in any cold storage warehouse that is to be erected.

I know that they had competent engineers making inquiries, and the Dairy and Cold Storage Commissioner, Mr. Rud-dick, accompanied one of the engineers to several cities in the United States to Iook over the most'up-to-date cold storage plants to be found in them. I have no doubt that as a result of their inquiries the most modern and up-to-date plant will be built in Montreal. I do not think the proposal advanced by the leader of the Opposition that a car should be run into the building, and the whole stored as a carload, is a practicable one. In fact, I think it would be very difficult, probably impossible, to carry out his suggestion. The most up-to-date facilities, however, will be provided for taking care of fish, fruit and any other perishable commodities that are shipped.
Now a word as to why Montreal wa3 selected. Montreal, of course, is a summer port, and it is during the summer months when temperatures are high that the need for cold storage is greatest. For that reason Montreal was selected as the initial point. There is already a cold storage plant in St. John, under the control of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Halifax is not as yet supplied with such a plant. I quite sympathize with the view expressed by the leader of the Opposition as to the necessity of proper abattoir and cold storage facilities in the province of Nova Scotia, or at any rate in one of the Maritime Provinces, and I presume Nova Scotia would be the most suitable, in order to encourage the development of the live stock industry in that part of Canada. It is quite true, as he has stated, that Nova Scotia cattle are at times shipped to Montreal for slaughter and the beef re-shipped for sale to the people of Nova Scotia. That on the face of it is an economic waste. At the request of the Provincial Department of Agriculture for Nova Scotia we have sent some of our officials to that province to make, in conjunction with the provincial officials, a survey of the whole situation with a view to ascertaining the best line of action to follow.

If we can hope to export cattle to the United States and hold that market, and if the embargo is removed from cattle going to Great Britain and we desire to ship cattle there, we must be sure that we send only healthy animals to those two markets; otherwise we cannot expect to retain them. The accredited herd system will give the advantage to the herd that is kept clean, and I sincerely hope that the breeders of the country will avail themselves of this opportunity to the fullest extent. I desire to congratulate the Health of animals Branch of the department on the work they have accomplished during the past few years. On several occasions we have had very serious outbreaks of infectious and contagious diseases immediately along the boundary line, and in nearly all cases none of the diseases have entered Canada., By preventing disease in that way through a close system of inspection we have been saved the loss of millions of dollars, and when we consider the small appropriation-I see there is an increase to a certain extent this year- and compare that appropriation with the

enormous value of the live stock in Canada, something between one and one and a half billions of dollars, it will be recognized that a very valuable work is being accomplished by this branch of the Department of Agriculture at a nominal cost.

I have been attempting to circulate the literature of the department for a great many years, and formerly I used to get a fair supply of material for distribution. The last time I applied, about two years ago, I was informed that I could get only a very limited supply, and that I would have to submit the names of my addressees to the department. Dealing with the large number of farmers to whom I would have to give literature T realized that a limited quantity would be only a source of embarrassment to me. I might select a few names and address material to them while the others would receive nothing, and from a political standpoint it would be better for me to send none at all. So that I did not send any. I do not think that members should be called upon to attend to a matter of this kind. Once the information is put into shape by the officers of the department who go to the pains of collecting their material the hardest part of the work is over, particularly when the literature is printed; and the department should see to it that this literature finds its way to the agriculturists of the country. It is a pity that tons of this material should be wasted

from year to year, and I strongly urge upon the minister that the officers who have charge of this branch should acquaint themselves with the names and addresses of the farmers from coast to coast. It is a large undertaking, but they can very readily get this information by applying to the agricultural societies in the several provinces. In this way they would get at least 75 or 80 per cent of the names of the farmers and as they have no postage to pay it would be a comparatively simple matter to send literature to the farmers. I wish to impress upon the minister the desirability of seeing that this information reaches those whom it will benefit. Undoubtedly it would be useful and might stimulate the farmer to greater efforts in the way of increased production, besides giving him new ideas. At all events it would impress him with the idea that the department is taking an interest in him and has his prosperity at heart. I know that only very few farmers of Canada receive any literature from the department. I would like to see literature relating to the farm finding its way into more houses and into the hands of more farmers than at present, for it would certainly have beneficial results.

I have found in my experience of several years that the best results are always obtained when the person who desires literature makes application for it in some form or other. Very often you get names from such a source as the voters' lists, and send circulars or pamphlets to the addresses there given, with the result that a large percentage of the literature thus sent finds its way into the waste basket. The evidence of interest on the part of the person applying for literature and the best guarantee that he will make proper rise of it when he gets it, is the fact that he goes to the trouble of applying for it. However, I entirely agree with the leader of the Opposition as to the importance of the matter.

with the minister as to the way in which this matter should be attended to. Possibly his view is one way of looking at it, but it seems to suggest the argument that we should not send missionaries to the distant islands and remote parts of the earth until they have made application for

some one to go and preach to them the gospel of the Nazarene. That is not the way in which the gospel is propagated. We send missionaries to the heathen and wake him up to the necessity of looking to the salvation of his soul, and in like manner we should send to the farmers, who need the information that we can give them, such literature as will be of benefit to them. If we did this we would create a desire on their part for more and more information, and applications would then be made in abundance. In many departments of life we are content to keep in the old rut, and if we do not assimilate new ideas we are apt to rest content with what was done by our grandfathers and fathers. The aim of the department should be to create a new interest in farming and they should not spare a few more dollars in putting necessary pamphlets and other useful records within the reach of the farmers if by so doing they can encourage them and stimulate an interest in rural life in Canada.

I would like to know from the minister if there is any combine or corner in connection with pure bred stock? There are, of course, large farmers and wealthy people who ""play the market"" to some extent in connection with stock at this time. Perhaps I should not use the expression ""play the market"", but many such persons make a hobby of raising fine cattle and horses and selling them at fancy prices. That is very good and we ought to be thankful, doubtless, to the people whose predilections lead them in that direction; but what I would like to know is, how can pure bred stock

be placed within reach of the ordinary farmers of the country without their paying such high prices as are charged? The Government may perhaps be taking some action along this line at present. I am satisfied, however, that there is riot enough of it done, at. all events in Nova Scotia, especially in the eastern part. There is need of further steps in this direction because I know that our cattle in many agricultural sections of 'the island of Cape Breton are not as good as they were twenty-five or thirty years ago. There is growing need of a revival in the matter of improved live stock, need of a better class of cattle and a better appreciation by the farmers of the advantage of having good stock rather than poor stock.

The federal Department of Agriculture does give specific assistance towards the promotion of the better breeding of live stock of all kinds. As far as cattle, sheep, and swine are concerned, it, is given in this way: Provision is, made for the supplying of pure-bred sires in each of these classes to associations of farmers that organize themselves and conform to certain regulations with which compliance is easy. The total number of sires that have been distributed in Canada is over two thousand. In other words, there were about two thousand of these associations in existence last year. Of that number, I am sorry to say, there were only twenty-nine in the province of Nova Scotia. The Department of Agriculture in that province carries on a somewhat similar work, but I am not at the moment able to give information as to the extent to which it does so, or as to the degree of success it has encountered. A very considerable portion of the expenditure contemplated by this vote is for this purpose. In the case of horses a percentage of the service fee is paid by the department, where the association is regularly formed, and its application has been regularly placed with the department. In all these cases as careful attention as possible is given to the securing of sound sires of the best quality available. There is no disguising the fact, however, that the general standard of our live stock, in cattle particularly,-in the beef typeu at any rate, -in Canada, is not as high as it might be. However, I believe that with .the general spread of knowledge and the insistence on the need of improvement, we will make greater progress in the future than we have

made in the past. We very frequently find, as every hon. member knows, farmers who are very largely indifferent to the type of animals that they have. They do not seem to realize as clearly as they should that it costs as much and even more to raise a scrub animal than it does to prodluce stock of a good type.

The present increase is to bring the appropriation back to what the amount was previous to that time.

I believe the money asked for here will be well spent in improving the live stock of our country, but I think a little leniency or consideration should have been given to the associations referred to. I have had my attention drawn particularly to the case of one association where the secretary was ill at the time the application should have been forwarded. I brought this fact before the department, but no consideration was given to the case. I think that was very unfair indeed. These men had formed an association at considerable cost to themselves, but owing to the fact that the secretary was ill at the time the application should have gone in, it was somewhat late in reaching the department, and it was declined. Now the intention of this vote toeing to help the farmers, there should have been a certain amount of leniency displayed in that particular case-in fact two instances of the kind were brought to my notice. Of course, if there are regulations governing this matter, they should be observed, but in such cases as I am referring to, the fact that delay in making the application was caused by illness should have been taken into consideration.
son for the delay, if I remember rightly, was the prevalence of influenza in the district concerned. But it is important that regulations, particularly in governmental administration, should be lived up to. When a department establishes a definite regulation for the governance of its work and that regulation is not adhered to, that moment the department is in difficulty. The regulation which the hon. gentleman criticises provides that these applications must be lodged with the department prior to April 1; in the case to which he refers the application came in ten days or two weeks late. Fully fifty similar applications came in after the first of April, running all the way from one to three days late up to five weeks late. If you admit one and refuse another, where are you going to draw the line? If you admit them all, what is the use of the regulation? If we violate the regulation for one, we must violate it for all, or we shall be charged with discrimination, favoritism, political pull and all the other things of a like nature. While I regret to disappoint my hon. friend, nevertheless I am sure that on reflection he will see the reasonableness of the position taken by the department in the matter.

as I stated a moment ago, the Regina fair last year had a surplus of $22,000 over and above their expenses. Now the B class fairs are doing just as much for the building up of the livestock industry as the A class fairs, and the larger cities like Regina do not need this grant of $5,000, but the smaller fairs do need assistance to carry on. I do not care whether the grant is $5 or $500, but I want all the B class fairs to be on the same footing. Yorktown and Prince Albert for instance, which did not comply with the regulations received the grant, while others did not. All I am asking for is a square deal.
Mr. CRERAR. If the fairs which the hon. member speaks for spent $3,600 last year in utility prizes they will participate in the grant this year. We have stretched the limit I think to the utmost. As to the relative merits of A and B class fairs, I dare say there are not a few hon. members in this House who would argue that the A class were more beneficial to the community than the B class. In the A class fairs the prize lists are larger, they have a bigger exhibition of livestock, and a great many more people patronize these fairs because they are held in the larger centres. The Toronto Fair, for instance, which runs for two weeks, undoubtedly attracts a great many more people than a fair in a little town of 2,000 people that runs for only three days. The policy of the Department may be open to criticism, but I am sure that the officials of the Department have studied the matter earnestly and honestly, with a view to getting the maximum of results for the money expended. I can assure the hon. member for Swift Current that it is not in the interest of any person in the department that B class fairs should
be discriminated against in favour of A class.

Toronto Fair Surplus $ 90,5<57.
Toronto, December 24.-Santa Claus, in the triple personality of T. A. Russell, president, Johnston G. Kent, manager, and Frank Brent-nail, treasurer of the Canadian National Exhibition, slid down the chimney into the City Hall to-day and presented Toronto with a cheque for $90,557.74, the biggest surplus by a good margin that the exhibition has ever paid.
It is quite apparent that such an exhibition which is able to finance itself should be able to concede a little bit to the pioneer districts in Western Canada, and some of the money might profitably go there.

I was very much impressed by the address to-night by the hon. member for Victoria (Mr. Tolmie), and I was thinking that if some hon. gentlemen like himself or some other person equally informed and gifted were travelling through the farming districts and telling the farmers the advantages of pure bred stock very satisfac-

tory results would accrue. I am not aware that any organized or proper effort is being made in the part of the country from which I come either by the local Agricultural Department or by this department to bring this education home to the farmers and to invite them to organize and take advantage of tne opportunities which the department offers to them.
I am sure that there are hundreds and thousands of people who are making their living as farmers to whose attention the advantage of having proper stock and the way in which they can get it has now been forcibly brought. If no effort has been made hitherto to have a proper organization along those lines and a campaign of education, I would suggest to the minister that he should have a proper arrangement with the agriculture departments of the different provinces so that this campaign of education may be carried on. There is such a thing, no doubt, as a duplicating and overlapping of effort. We have agricultural societies in Nova Scotia under the supervision and control of the local legislature which do fairly good work, but we must push this work if we are to produce the results necessary to reach the high-water mark in regard to it. I am particularly pleased with the information which the hon. member for Victoria city has given us and I trust the Department of Agriculture will be able to present this matter to the people in such a way as to reach parts of the country that have not so far taken advantage of their opportunities. I am not finding fault with the department, because they seem to be doing good worx but I would like to go one step farther and press home upon the farmers the advisability of taking advantages of the opportunities which are made available t-o them through the department.

is for the purpose of encouraging the production of farm and garden crops. There is another method of encouraging the production of farm and garden crops which is not indicated fully in the description as contained in this item, and tha't is to find a market for that which has been produced. About a month ago I took the opportunity of asking the then Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) for information regarding some correspondence I had from a citizen living in the constituency that I

have the honour to represent. The Acting Prime Minister stated then that the Government had supplied altogether $80,000,000 to help in the marketing of Canadian wheat and that they were arranging, if my memory serves me aright, a credit of $90,000,000 additional for the same purpose. ' But he failed to explain why it was that any farmer found it difficult to find a market for his wheat and intimated that the wheat was not of proper grade. I have had since then considerable .correspondence from a number of farmers in the same section, as well as a number of millers, and they all have the same story to tell, that there is a large quantity of 11 p.m. wheat, fully twenty per cent of last year's crop, still in the hands of farmers. They all say that they cannot find a market for it. It may be difficult for a man like the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) or the Minister of Agriculture to understand that, and yet that is the story that comes to me from the riding of South Renfrew. The hon. member for Chateauguay-Huntingdon (Mr. Robb) .made an inquiry regarding the same subject a few days ago and the Minister of Finance informed him then that the Government were negotiating with the Greek Government for the disposal of 15,000,000 or 20,000,000 bushels of wheat. Notwithstanding this information, I am still confronted with the proposition that the farmers in South Renfrew have that quantity of wheat on their hands and are not able to dispose of it. Just a couple of days ago I received a letter from the proprietors of the Killaloe Roller Mills Company. This was sent in response to an inquiry made by me, and they informed me that there are at least ten . or twelve cars of wheat within hauling distance of their mill but that owing to the fact that they are unable to find a market for their flour they cannot purchase this wheat. The consequence is that this wheat will remain on the farmers' hands. The farmers are anxious' because, as I understand, the guaranteed price for wheat will be withdrawn and the farmers with 18,000 or 20,000 bushels of wheat in one little section of South Renfrew will be left with this wheat on their hands. There are other sections in the same position, and they naturally view the situation with considerable anxiety. I rise to discuss this issue on this item because it is my opinion that if the Government and department will find a market for that wheat they will certainly encourage production. These men were induced to in-

crease their acreage during the past two years for war purposes. In the last two years they increased their production by fifty per cent. That is the opinion of the several milling concerns in the riding. A market was held out to them as an inducement and as a result of that inducement there was increased acreage and increased production. If you want farmers to increase production no better method can be adopted than to insure a market for what they produce. Here is -the case as I find it not only in that one section of my constituency but in several other sections as well. They have the wheat on hand but no market. They want me to find out what the Government are going to do about this situation.
I would like to know the exact attitude of the Government in regard to the disposition of wheat which is in the hands of farmers at the present time, particularly in South Renfrew, in which I am naturally most interested. Will the Government undertake to find a market for that wheat at the guaranteed price? Should not the farmers expect the Government to take action along definite lines? Will the Government undertake to purchase the wheat to fill the contracts referred to a couple of days ago by the Minister of Finance? Will the hen. gentleman say that this wheat will be purchased for that purpose?

The quality of the wheat raised in the Bonnechere Valley is equal to what is considered Manitoba No. 1 Hard. That is the reputation of the wheat raised generally
in that section. And I am informed by one of the millers that the quality of the wheat sold there is first-class in every particular.
1 might further state that this miller wrote to the department, and I have the letter which he received in reply. It is certainly not very encouraging. With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I will read it. It 'is dated April the 24th, and is as follows:
Dear Sirs,-I have your letter of April 18th, but regret to state that there is very little in formation I can give you, except that conditions have changed materially during the past year The great shortage of ocean steamships has led to congestion in many parts of the world. An arrangement was entered into some time ago with the British Government by which the Wheat Export Company were to take the exportable surplus of the 1918 crop on the -basis of the fixed prices. The British Government, however, has -been unable to purchase the quantity at first thought necessary in view of the congestion at British ports and the very large quantity of wheat in the United Kingdom, larger quantities in fact than at any time since the outbreak of war. The whole question of the marketing of the Canadian wheat and flour is now engaging the attention of the Government. It is a difficult problem, however, in view of the present world wide conditions. Apparently matters can only adjust themselves.
It will be seen that this letter suggests no way out of the difficulty, and I would like to know if it is not possible for the Govern-men to assist the section of the country referred to in this respect.

I certainly think it is, if the minister is to make a statement of the Government's policy in regard to pensions.
Hon. NEWTON W. ROWELL (President of the Council): If this were a statement of the Government's policy I would at once concur in my hon. friend's suggestion. But the policy of the Government with regard to pensions, as well as the policy of the Pensions Committee, will come up for consideration when the Pensions Committee's Report is presented, which report I think will be in shape for presentation next week. The Pensions Committee has practically completed its work, and its report will then come up together with a Bill which the committee is drafting for submission to the House. All questions of policy will come up for review when the Bill is being considered. This is simply a vote of the estimated amount required on the basis of the existing pension schedule. If the Pensions Committee recommends some increases, as will likely be the case, that will involve a supplementary estimate being brought down; the whole question will come up for very full consideration when we have the committee's report before us, and the Pensions Bill which will have to be considered section by section. I thought, therefore, I would make simply a very brief statement, [Air. Pedlow.]
giving an outline of the present position of affairs. This item might then be permitted to pass, and we could discuss the whole question of policy when we come to deal with the report of the Pensions Committee.
This is simply an estimate based on a certain number of estimated pensioners- taking the figures for last year, plus the estimated number of pensions for the coming year. The total casualties in the Canadian Expeditionary Force .up to 8th of May of the present year, were 212,182. Of that number there were either killed or died of wounds or disease 63,347, and the total number of wounded was 148,835. That gives us the total possible pension claims up to date, and very few could subsequently arise; of course, some further claims may be presented before demobilization is completed. Taking first the killed, that is 63,347, it is estimated that no pension will be applied for in the case of approximately fifteen per cent of that number. That is there will be fifteen per cent with no dependents who would be entitled to claim any pension, and the Pension Board estimates that the total number of pensions which will probably be granted in respect of men killed in action or that have died of wounds will be 53,854-at least that is the total number in respect of which claim might be made to come within the provisions of the pension regulations. Now, so far 22,612 of these cases have come up for consideration by the Pensions Board, which is not quite one-half of the possible pension claimants in the case of those killed. Of the 22,612 claims which have come up for consideration and been dealt with, 16,959 have been allowed, and 5,653 have been refused on the ground that they did not come within the provisions of the pension regulations. That leaves 31,233 yet to be dealt with if claims are presented, and if they are disposed of on the same basis. In other words, if the percentage of claims that should be allowed is the same in the future as in the past, experience has shown it would come to 23,425 more pensions to be allowed in respect of those who have been killed in action or who have died of wounds. With that as a basis the Board of Pension Commissioners is able to estimate the total amount payable to dependents of those killed in action or who have died of wounds, and it is on that basis that that part of the present estimate is made up.
Then, take the case of disabilities. I gave the total number of wounded as 148,835. A number were wounded more than once and

returned to the firing line. It is impossible, of course, until all claims are in, to ascertain accurately how many have been wounded more than once. But for the purpose of this estimate the Board of Pensions Commissioners have put down the number at five per cent of the total, or 7,441, leaving 141,394 as the number of cases or disabilities for which claims might possibly he made. Of these, 71,834, about fifty per cent, have already been dealt with, and of the 71,834, 53,876 have been allowed and 17,958 disallowed, as not coming within the provisions of the pension regulations. If the remaining applications or possible applications are disposed of on the same basis, we would have 52,170 additional pensioners on the ground of disability. This estimate is based on the assumption that we shall have that additional number and that the average amount payable in case of disability will be the same in the new cases as in the cases already allowed. On that basis, the total estimated Pension Bill of the Dominion when all cases are disposed of will be $32,814,391, assuming that no increase is made in our pension schedule and that no change is made in the regulations so as to bring in cases that are now excluded. Of that amount, it is estimated that we shall require this year the amount mentioned in the Estimate. As a number of men have not been discharged from the army and the right to pension has not yet arisen, the full amount will not be required this year; it is estimated that $28,000,000 will cover the pension bill for this year on the basis of the present schedule of disabilities. If the Pension Committee recommends and the House concurs in some increase in the pension schedules, a Supplementary Estimate will be brought down to cover that estimated increase. That, in brief, is the basis of the expenditure under this vote of $28,000,000. If any further information is desired I shall be glad to give it as we proceed.

It is the Pensions Board that deals with all these matters, and the Board is the final authority in connection with them under regulations passed by this House. I understand, however, that the Pension Board states that the facts are somewhat as follows: That on 4th October the case came to the attention of the Board of Pension Commissioners and that on the fifth of October Mr. Taylor was examined and recommended for treatment, and he was granted treatment under the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment on the 7th October. For reasons which probably Mr. Taylor considered sufficient but which were not explained, he discontinued the treatment of his own volition within a few days after he was recommended for it. I should point out to the committee that those receiving treatment are on pay and allowance during the whole period of the treatment, and if a man is married his wife gets a sum similar to the separation allowance. It is quite true, as the hon. member has suggested, that there was some mistake in notifying the Pensions Board by the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, and his pension was not resumed as it should have been when he discontinued the treatment. According to the regulations while a man is receiving treatment, if he is a pensioner, he draws pay and allowance paid by the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment and his pension is discontinued. When he ceases treatment, his pension is resumed, and under the conditions there was a holding over of the pensiofi and the man has in that sense a

grievance and ground for complaint because of the mistake made in reference to notification to the Board of Pension Commissioners. I understand the situation is at present that he has been asked to go to Winnipeg for further examination, and if treatment is recommended, for treatment. Winnipeg is a neurological centre; they have there experts who can provide the treatment. The information which the Board of Pension Commissioners has is that this is a neurological case; and that treatment of that kind is necessary and that, if applied, will restore the man to health and should give him the use of his limbs, and, therefore, that man should, they think, go to Winnipeg to take the treatment. The expense to Winnipeg is paid, and if he takes the treatment he receives pay and allowance. That is the information I have received. I have, of course, no power to give the assurance for which tne hon. member asks. The Government has no such power under the regulations adopted which were considered wise at the time in order to prevent any question of politics interfering. The rules adopted, recommended by the Pension Committee, expressly provide that the decision of the Board of Pension Commissioners is final. There is no appeal to the Government and the Government has no right to override their decision. I will, however, personally look into this matter to see if there appears to be a grievance Or miscarriage of justice, with a view to urging the board to remedy any injury if one appears to have been inflicted. That is as far as I can go, because this is a case in which the decision of the board is final.

Will you kindly make it convenient to call at this office as soon as possible with a view to sending you to Winnipeg for a neurological examination? Transportation and expenses will 'be supplied to you.
No mention is made of treatment, and as the man had already been sent to Winnipeg for examination on two occasions, I think he was perfectly right in refusing to go a third time after, for a year, getting a pension of $5 a month.
As regards the man's having a grievance, I can assure the minister that I know just as much about these cases as most of the medical boards of this country, and more than some of them, according to this case; and this man has a grievance, and I intend to see that it is rectified.

There was an approach towards an agreement, but no agreement was finally

reached. A great many proposals on one side and the other were put forward, and the final result, about seven o'clock in the evening, was that the employers made a proposal in writing which, I think, was furnished to the press, and which was to be submitted by the representatives of the labour organizations to the men in Toronto. I believe it was so presented, but the men did not see fit to accept it. The chief question under discussion yesterday was the granting of a week of forty-four hours, and it was upon that question that the employers finally decided to offer arbitration.

Is that not a good rule to apply to the judges? L notice that, by legislation of Ontario, there is to be a considerable reduction in the number of County Court judges in that province. In this case we are proposing to increase the number of judges in British Columbia. I have not sufficient knowledge of British Columbia to offer an opinion in the matter, but it seems odd that at a time when Ontario is cutting down the number of its judges British Columbia finds it necessary to make an increase. I know the difficulty that arises owing to the jurisdiction of the provinces in the matter of the courts and the fact that the Dominion has to provide the judges and pay the bills. I know this is a layman's view and that laymen ought not to say much about these things; but there is a wide-spread opinion that the rule of having fewer officials and paying them better is a good one to apply to the judges as well as to other branches of the public service.

understands the necessity for greater and more scientific agricultural production in the future. All the financial and economic authorities who have lately given their views as regards present conditions in Canada have insisted on the fact that what is needed is greater production The chief industry of Canada is above all farming. This is a great farming community and the more we can attract the people to

country life the more wo shall do in the way of restoring the country to a basis of sound economy and prosperity. There must be more production along scientific lines. Although I am not much over the fifty-year mark, there has been in my day and generation quite a change in the method of agriculture. I shall not speak for other sections of the country, but the section with which I am most familiar. Even in the constituency of Gaspe, where the people are fishermen and farmers simultaneously, I have noticed during the last twenty years a change for the better in agricultural methods. This, I am pleased to say, is due in a large degree to the very progressive education given our farmers by the Department of Agriculture in Quebec, and also, I must say, by the officials of the Department of Agriculture at Ottawa. I do not know how the other provinces regard the lectures given to farmers, but speaking for my constituency of Gaspe I can say that the people are always pleased to meet the lecturers sent by .the Department of Agriculture and that they quietly, without any great demonstration, adopt the methods suggested by the lecturers. In addition to this, the small experimental farms, not to speak of the largest, have produced the best results. If there is one expenditure to which the minister should commit himself more in the future, it is for the multiplication of these small farms.
I have in my mind especially the recommendations made by Professor Robertson in the report of the Commission on Technical Education. These latter recommendations have been published in pamphlet form and I have found them very instructive indeed. If I had any advice to offer my hon. friend it would be to try and live up to the recommendations made by Professor Robertson. I must compliment the Department of Agriculture in Ottawa upon having given to the district to which I belong politically-the district of Quebec- the magnificent experimental farm located in the constituency of my hon. friend from Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe). The agricultural school at St. Anne de la Pocatiere is a Quebec institution and a very progressive one, but, since its establishment at the request of my hon. friend from Kamouraska, the Government has supplemented the work of that school by the establishment of an experimental farm and, following the establishment of the farm, there have been exhibitions every year which would be of interest even to the farmers of the other provinces of Canada.

While I am in a laudatory mood, might I not congratulate sincerely the Minister of Agriculture upon the appointment which he has made of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture. I must be frank, sincere and honest in my appreciation of the good work accomplished by the Department of Agriculture. The farmers who sit in this House and the farmers in the country-at least the farmers in our part of the country- appreciate the great work which was done some years ago by the Hon. Sydney Fisher. He changed completely the complexion of the department and gave to it a very high standing in the country. The Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Crerar) enjoys to a large degree the confidence of the public because, as we know, he is a farmer and he is proud of it. In the appointment of his officials he has done the right thing in making them without regard to political considerations. He has appointed Mr. Grisdale and I have noticed that in the press and on both sides of politics that appointment has been hailed as a progressive step. Mr. Grisdale has had a long experience. He is known throughout Canada. He is a modest, humble official but stern and sturdy in the discharge of his official duties. He has another great advantage which we cannot ignore. He speaks both languages fluently. How can you expect to reach the different farming communities in the different provinces if the officers of the department cannot be understood in the literature which they send out to every section of the country or in the lectures which they deliver to their farming audiences? By appointing Mr. Grisdale you have appointed the best officer in the department to a position which he will fill, we know, with great profit to the country. Besides, any farmer from my province can come to him, speak in his own language and be answered and understood as if he were speaking to one of his own fellow countrymen. I congratulate my hon. friend on this appointment. I hope that under Mr. Grisdale the department will continue the traditions established by the predecessor of my hon. friend the Hon. Sydney Fisher, who was really the friend of the farmer.

But it makes no difference. These gentlemen, taking advantage of what they knew was going to happen, wired to their agents in Western Canada and bought up all the butter held by the factories in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and partly in Alberta, before the advance in price. Immediately in the United States prices began to go up. Milk and cream were on the free list, and the farmers along the international line and quite a distance away from the line discovered that they could sell their milk in the United States at $3.55 on a 3 per cent butter-fat basis, which worked out at .about $4.05 for extra good milk per 100 pounds. As against that, the price at which it was commandeered in Canada would give them from $1.75 to $2.05 and very naturally the flow of milk started to the United States. When the Government discovered this they placed an embargo on milk and cream, going into the United States, so that .this condition obtained for the month of October and part of November, and if I mistake not it was February before the embargo was totally raised. My friends from the western provinces who year in and year out have told us of the greater prices that have prevailed in the	Minneapolis market for wheat
can	very well	understand how the
eastern dairyman felt when he discovered that his neighbour across the line was receiving from $1 to $1.50 per 100 pounds more for milk than he was. When the farmer discovered that he could not ship his milk or cream owing to the embargo he decided to sell his cow, and that largely explains the great increase in the exports in cattle into the United States from all parts of Canada, and explains also why the cities to-day are suffering, or at any rate did suffer all winter.

In respect of the restrictions on the exportation of milk and other products to the United States, what was the situation that existed in August last, at a time when the struggle between the German armies and the Allies had reached its greatest intensity in Europe? The British people were practically face to face with a situation where butter could not be secured, and their rations were down to half an ounce per person per week. They requested the food Administrations of the United States and Canada to take some action that would relieve them in this respect. It was essential that the morale of the British and French people should be kept at its highest possible point at that time, and as a result cf their request the United States Food Administration commandeered outright, if my memory is correct, 60 per cent of the butter supplies then in cold storage in the United States. Coupled with this question is also the matter of the price of the article at home. The United States commandeered supplies in stock without limitations as to prices, and the result was that within a few weeks, due to the withdrawal from consumption of

this large quantity of butter, prices in the United States rapidly rose until they advanced some 12 to 18 cents per pound over what they had previously been.

The sowing of seed which contains wild seeds not only curtails the amount of the grain produced, but leaves the land in a wild state and gives rise to much additional work and trouble for years to come. As the machinery for properly cleaning grain costs a good deal of money, it is beyond the reach of the average farmer. It is up to the minister, therefore, to see that the people of Ontario are provided with an elevator at some convenient place, where they may store their grain and have it re-cl6aned and dried if necessary. I think I am not going beyond the truth when I say that had we had an elevator in some convenient place in Ontario last year half of its cost would have been made up by the saving of the beans that were lost in that province because of the lack of facilities for properly cleaning them. In the eastern part of the province the condition is not so bad, because Montreal is within easy reach. But the farmers lost three or four cents a bushel on the grain shipped by rail from Toronto to Montreal; it was inspected when it arrived there and they had to take what they could get for it. i am not much in favour of every-

thing going to the large centres, but if this grain could be re-cleaned properly, say at Toronto, where there are good railway facilities, and if there was proper elevator accommodation, with all the necessary machinery for cleaning, thousands of dollars would be saved for the people of Ontario. Some years ago much seed wheat was shipped out of Ontario to Western Canada. A good deal of that wheat was not properly cleaned and was not in proper condition when it was sent out. During the past winter thousands of bushels of oats have been shipped from Ontario to Western Canada for seed. The farmers received from sixty to seventy cents a bushel for those oats, whereas if the oats had been cleaned they could have got from seventy-five to eighty cents a bushel. The farmers were losing from five to ten cents a bushel on those oats, because cleaning would cost only a few cents a bushel. The Government has received deputations asking that an elevator be established in some convenient place in Ontario, and I hope the minister will see that we have one built for the convenience and benefit of the farmers. I believe the outlay would be paid for almost every year.

time, when the hon.

I understand they have built houses on certain sections of land; and they sell not only the bare land but the houses and barns and some equipment. In that way they have given a great boom to agriculture in that part of the country. We have in Nova Scotia millions of acres that are unoccupied, and it is not unusual to find a man owning four or five hundred acres and living on it with his wife, being able to scratch a bare living out of perhaps five per cent of the land. That land to which I refer could be used to great advantage if people could be found to take an interest in agriculture, and I am sure the Government would lose no money if they undertook this project. All they need is courage and enterprise, and they would find these little farms would be successful and would give a fresh impetus to agriculture. It was thought in the early days that the thing would be practicable, and there was some co-operation between the honourable gentleman (Mr. Burrell) and the Minister of Agriculture for Nova Scotia. Some start was made in the buying of old farms but the matter was not looked after properly and nothing of importance has really been done. What is absolutely e* sential for the development of the country is that it shall be a place in which the ordinary man can live in comfort, and the only way in which that can be achieved is to encourage the farmer to produce and enable him to sell at reasonable prices. The only advantage to the farmer is the profit he makes, and if he can make a large
profit it is better for the country. He may make a fair profit on a small quantity, but if he can make a proportionate profit on large quantities of produce there is a beneficial result all round. It is absolutely necessary for the Department of Agriculture to make a departure from the rut in which we have been moving for the last twenty-five years, and to show what can be done along these lines. I have no particular line to indicate to the minister, but I have suggested what might be done in the neighbourhood of large centres. I have spoken of Cape Breton because I know men there who are ready to take hold of these little farms if they are put within their reach. They have not the means themselves to buy lands and put up houses, but if they were helped up to that stage they would jump at the proposition. The market is there and they could sell their produce, and there are young men from the Old Country who are enterprising enough to do very well if they were given a start. Another thing I might point out is the desirability of encouraging the extension of tram cars that are in touch with agricultural land so as to encourage the farmer. Companies might be encouraged to push their lines into the country. These things cost money, but the minister in charge of the department must have courage to depart from the old line and not hesitate to spend money abundantly so long as good results can be obtained. We want to make 'Canada produce something proportionate to its capacity for production.
Mr. iLEiMIEUX: In connection with the distribution of literature, I have noticed that literature is printed in both languages and when any one applies to the department he can get either French or English copies. I want to inform the minister-and this can be confirmed by the deputy minister-that the best agent of the department in my province is the cure, who is generally the honorary president and sometimes the secretary of what we call the Circles Agricoles. There is one in every county, and sometimes one in every parish, and in the pulpit on nearly every 'Sunday of the year in these rural districts the cure will spend a portion of his time speaking to the farmers on agricultural matters.
I would like my hon. friend to send the literature which is issued by the department in French-not all, but the most essential bulletins-to the cures of the province of Quebec, so as to secure their devotion to the cause. Because the great issue of the day is the necessity of getting our

people back to the land and improving living conditions in the rural districts. I have offered these remarks now because unfortunately, I shall not be able to be present this evening.
Mr. 'CRERAR:	I can say to the hon.
gentleman that the suggestion which he has made will be acted upon.

This farm at Spirit Lake is in my constituency, in the far north. There is another farm at Kapuskasing, only a few miles away; one is in Quebec and the other is in Ontario. Something like $80,000 a year is being spent on these farms-an extraordinarily large amount. Moreover, the expenditure on the Experimental Farm at Ottawa seems to be entirely out of proportion to the results that are being obtained. The minister tells us that they developed a kind of wheat there some years ago. The older members of the House tell me, however, that that argument has been practically worked to death here; that seems to be the only explanation each year for increasing the expenditure. Does the minister not think that a better system might be worked out by distributing smaller farms throughout the country and doing the



work on a purely business basis in the different provinces? These large farms in Ottawa and at other points are purely experimental farms. A demonstration farm is quite different from an experimental farm. A demonstration farm would show the farmers in the community how to improve their seed, their stock, and their conditions generally; the experimental farm would seem to make experiments from which the independent farmer can obtain no profit. Does not the minister think that this money could be more profitably expended on demonstration farms?

In every country that is making any effort to secure sound agricultural development, experimental farms and stations and demonstration stations are maintained.
As to the increase which the hon. member criticises, the matter resolves itself simply into this, that if we are to pay the increased cost of operation, such as the increase in wages and the higher cost of material, due to causes over which the Department of Agriculture has no control, then, if we are to keep the vote at the same amount as last year, we shall have to cut down the efficiency of the farms, and that would not be a wise move nor justified in any way. The development of agriculture in every country in the world is becoming more and more dependent upon the application of sound, scientific methods, not only in respect to methods of cultivation as to cereals, fruits and vegetables, but in the field of animal husbandry, which is of immense importance. For instance, as was pointed out this afternoon, the beef animals produced in Canada are inferior to those produced in the Argentine and in the United States. Experiments which are being carried on at several stations and farms, demonstrate conclusively the advantages of producing higher class animals at practically the same or even slightly lower cost than inferior animals. Those facts are published, and they are also made known to those who visit the farms and personally acquaint themselves with the experiments that are being carried on. We have passed the time when the utility and advantages of experimental farms and stations can be successfully challenged. It is, perhaps, an open question as to what is the best method of carrying on the work. I said .this afternoon, and I will repeat it 
now for the information of the hon. member, that from the information we are gathering it seems that the establishment of illustration farms will probably prove the most effective method of bringing the farmers closely and directly in touch with the advantages of the work that is being carried on-.

to numerous matters that have arisen recently in the House? The ministers in charge of the Estimates are always unable to inform us in regard to the general policy of the Government. The Government seems to be largely a Government of individuals, each with his own particular department in mind and unable to say just how far that department may go. This matter of cold storage is one of the most serious questions that confront the Canadian people to-day, and the Government should have a policy with regard to it. The press would lead us to believe that the people controlling the packing and cold storage plants have been making exorbitant profits. Ministers of the Government have defended the character and business ability of some of the gentlemen who have made these exorbitant profits. Conditions in Canada to-day are not satisfactory to the labouring people; they have the impression that the cold storage plants are getting too much out of the producers and the consumers. Probably twenty-five to thirty-three and a third per cent of Canada's produce is wasted for the want of proper storage facilities. The erection of a plant at Montreal wdll not relieve the situation in all other parts of the country. The erection of cold storage plants in the United States or in European countries seems to be a simple matter. Having regard to our long shipping distances and to the general conditions in this country, it would be good business for the Government to find out what it would cost to build plants so that they may be able to give that information to the towns and cities of Canada. A cold storage plant is just as important as the hen-coop or pig-sty. If it is necessary to take the duty off certain articles to promote a policy of this kind the Government can do it, just as they took the duty off farm tractors. The Government should reduce the high cost of living by providing better cold storage facilities and by making the profiteers dispose of their food products before they are allowed to rot. The minister says he has no power to do these things. Why, with the War-time Elections Act and all the other various Acts which have vested power in the Government they are able to do anything. All it requires is courage, and if my hon. friend would show some courage in the direction of satisfying the common people, the poor people, the producers, rather than the profiteers, he would be in very much better grace in Canada than he is to-day. I hope that this matter will receive the serious consideration of the Minister and that he will
look into the storage problem as one of the most serious problems that Canada faces.

In fact, he impressed me quite strongly by the earnestness of his appeal. Now he suggests that we embark on a policy that would involve the expenditure of millions. If the hon. gentleman wishes my opinion as to the policy that should be adopted-in fact, so far as announcement has been made or anything has been done it is the policy that has been adopted-it is the duty of the federal administration to provide the necessary facilities for the transportation of these products and for the care of them at ocean ports and, generally, to assist in the trade and commerce of the country. If the hon. gentleman has in mind the erection of cold storage plants in every city, town, and village in Canada, the proposition would be a very large one and might better be taken up by municipal enterprise. We have already decided on the policy of giving assistance by way of bonus to municipal cold storage plants. Any town in my hon. friend's constituency, any town or city in Canada, can say to the Government: We propose to erect a municipal cold storage plant and to make it available for the public-for merchants, farmers and all who want to use it; and the Government will upon certain conditions give assistance to the extent of thirty per cent of the cost of erecting such a plant. It would be well to test this policy out for a few years and see what results come from it, rather than to embark on an expenditure that might run into millions.

The farming community of Canada is at the present time in a favourable position as regards the minister who now presides over the Department of Agriculture. We have a fine, practical Minister of Agriculture, and I think it would be hard to get any one to equal him. Further than that, he has a deputy who is well known throughout this Dominion -and who has endeared himself to the farming community by his practical knowledge of agriculture. I refer to Professor Grisdale, a man whom I am pleased to say I have 'known for many years. He knows all the ins and outs of the farmers' requirements as well as, if not better than, any other man in Canada or possibly in any other country. Canada has been very fortunate in her choice of officials in regard to agriculture, and we need such officials now more than at any other time in our history. During the last few years, farmers have had difficulties like all other people, but I think we have suffered more than people of any other calling. It seems probable, moreover, that we are going to suffer some hardships this year on account of the backwardness of the season and of having so much rain that we can hardly get our crops in. But it is the duty of every one, no matter what his calling may be, to co-operate with the rest of the community and use his best efforts to make our soil produce as much as possible. Nothing but agricultural production will enable us to get rid of the tremendous burden of public debt which has accumulated. Agriculture is the

backbone of this country and as one who has been a farmer all his life I have no hesitation in saying that if this country were farmed as it should be, the land at present under cultivation would produce over a hundred per cent more than it does now. If we also take into account the many millions of acres the plough has not yet touched what will be the result? Not long ago, I was out West and every four or five miles there was an elevator. Not one of these elevators was built for fun; they were built to hold grain, and when they are full the returns to this country will, I am sure, surprise every one. A year or two of good crops in this Canada of ours would nearly wipe out the national debt. The money may not go as revenue direct to the Government, but it will go to individuals. We shall have the money, and when we have the money, the country will be the richer by that amount. I am glad that we have live men at the head of the Department of Agriculture, because we require live men and men who have an interest in the work and welfare of the country and I have no doubt that those men will use their efforts to the best advantage of Canada.

REID:,,SUPPLY.,,,"I wish to congratulate the minister on the very popular appointment which he has made to the position of Deputy Minister of Agriculture. Now that the minister and his deputy are both farmers we may expect great results from the administration of this department. Heretofore it would seem to have been essential that we should have a lawyer as deputy minister. Personally, I fail to see any connection between the law and the agricultural industry. 'I am, therefore, glad that the Government has got away from any such policy, and that in consequence we are likely to see most beneficial results as far as the development of agriculture is concerned. For one thing I would like to see the Government establish more experimental farms. To my mind there could not be a better investment than to add to their number. Let me give a specific instance of the value of these farms. It will be recalled that the late Dr. Saunders, who in his life time was Director of Experimental Farms, after a very prolonged and tedious series of experiments produced a distinct [DOT]type of wheat called Marquis Wheat. That particular variety has been of the utmost benefit to Canada, and I venture to assert has brought millions of dollars to this country. In Western Canada we are practically getting away altogether from the growing of the old Red Fife Wheat; and I understand that when the farmers of Ontario brought samples of that wheat from the West for seed purposes and tried them, they found that they could grow spring wheat through the agency of the Marquis. At present we have in Saskatchewan Mr. Seager Wheeler, who is doubtless known by reputation to many of the members of this House. Mr. Wheeler is a veritable wizard in producing and propagating different varieties of grain, and, as is well known, is the winner of the world's championship in wheat. At the present time he is experimenting with two other distinct varieties of wheat, the Kitchener and the Red Bobs. I think the Government should do something to encourage Mr. Wheeler in carrying on his work. For a long time he has spent almost all his time in experimenting along these lines, and now, I understand, his health ds breaking down. Mr. Wheeler's work has been of very great value, not only to the growers but to the consumers of wheat in this country. I mention these facts so 
that the minister may give his careful consideration to the matter:
Another thing I would like to draw attention to is the live stock situation. If a careful survey were taken to-day of our live stock resources, principally cattle, I believe it would be found that the situation in Canada to-day is not as good as it was, say, ten years ago. I believe that is because pure-bred sires are not being imported into Canada from the Old Country where they breed the best stock in the world. I am informed that the Argentine buyers, when they go to the United Kingdom, purchase not only pure-bred sires but female stock; they buy the very best that can be found on the market. As regards Canada I do not wish to say a word against our importers of pure-bred live stock, but with them it seems to be a matter of dollars and cents and very naturally they figure on how many dollars they can make out of a transaction. I think if our Government were to import some of the best of the different types of pure-bred cattle- pure-bred sires at least and a few of the -females-and then possibly let them out on some terms, or sell them to the stock raisers of the Dominion, so that we would have a continuous stream of the best pure-bred animals coming into Canada, it would be a splendid thing for our live stock industry.
Mr. .T. R. WILSON: The hon. gentleman who has just spoken has mentioned a matter which I am very much interested in, and which I had intended bringing to the attention of the minister, and that is the good work which Mr. Seagar Wheeler, of Saskatchewan, has been carrying on in the development of different varieties of wheat. While he was not the discoverer of Marquis wheat, Mr. Wheeler, by a process of selection, I believe, greatly improved upon the original discovery. For the information of the Committee I would like to read certain information as evidence of what Mr. Wheeler has done. As a result of his own effort, and without any assistance whatever, he is advertising Canada as a wheat producing country more than any other man that I know of. He has done this entirely at his own expense, and mainly through exhibiting the results of his experiments at exhibitions and wheat seed fairs, in the United States. Let me enumerate some of the prizes he has won in competition with the Western States as well as with various competitors from Canada.

1911.__New York Land Show. Won world's
prize, first and sweepstakes, $1,000 in gold, offered for the best hard red spring wheat grown on the continent. Won this prize with Marquis wheat, then almost unknown.
1914.	_1Von sweepstakes at International Farm Congress, Wichita, Kansas, winning again with Marquis wheat.
1915.	-Won sweepstakes with Marquis wheat at International Farm Congress at Denver, Colorado. Also first prize at International Irrigation Congress, Bassano, Alberta. Won highest honours for sheaf of Kitchener wheat at Denver.
1916.	-Won sweepstakes for fourth time, this year at International Farm Congress at El Paso, Texas, with Kitchener wheat, discovered by Mr. Wheeler.
1917.	-Mr. Wheeler wias hailed out in 1916', but exhibited a sheaf of Red Bobs Wheat, which he discovered, at International Farm Congress, Peoria, Illinois, and carried off sweepstakes.
1918.	-Won sweepstakes for fifth time for best bushel of hard spring wheat, winning this time against very strong competition at the International Soil Products Exposition, Kansas City. Won with Marquis wheat again. Also won first for sheaf of hard red wheat.
But Mr. Wheeler did not confine his efforts to wheat. Here are some of the prizes he won for oats:
1915.-Victory Oats. Won sweepstakes with a sheaf exhibit at International Farm Congress, Denver, Colorado.
1917,	-Won second prize in sheaf exhibit at International Farm Congress.
1918,	-Won first prize for sheaf exhibit at International Soil Products Exposition at Kansas City, Kansas.
He has taken up also the improvement of
barley. The following are some of the prizes that he has won in this connection:
19,14.-won third prize at International Irrigation Congress, Calgary, Alta.
1915.	-Won first prize for sheaf exhibit, International Farm Congress, Denver, Colorado.
1916.	-Won first and sweepstakes at International Farm Congress, El Paso, Texas.
1917.	-First prize for sheaf exhibit, International Farm Congress, Peoria, 111.
1918.	-Won first prize, International Soil Products Exposition, Kansas City, Kansas.
This man should have some recognition from the Department of Agriculture.

But it seems to me that as this Mr. Seager Wheeler has been doing great work for the country, there should be some way in which he could be assisted in that work, and I have a suggestion to make to the minister in that connection. A little while ago the minister 'spoke about illustration stations which, I understand, are on farms belonging to private farmers.

Secretary of 'State (Mr. Burrell) was Minister of Agriculture, we used to discuss the advisability of establishing not altogether demonstration farms but small farms for the development of agriculture. The idea was that some of the $10,000,000 set apart for the development of the industry could be utilized in 'buying small farms in the neighbourhood of industrial centres, say, for instance, near the steel works in the county from which I come, where there are thousands of farmers' sons, and men from Ireland, England and Scotland who make marvellous developments of little bits of land about their houses. I-t was thought that if the Government could establish thirty or forty or even twenty small farms of between twenty-five and forty acres each, with house and barn, and give a small start in the way of developing these farms, and then sell them, men would be very anxious and willing to go in for the scheme. The idea has been developed in the West by the Canadian Pacific Railway. I understand they have built houses on certain sections of land; and they sell not only the bare land but the houses and barns and some equipment. In that way they have given a great boom to agriculture in that part of the country. We have in Nova Scotia millions of acres that are unoccupied, and it is not unusual to find a man owning four or five hundred acres and living on it with his wife, being able to scratch a bare living out of perhaps five per cent of the land. That land to which I refer could be used to great advantage if people could be found to take an interest in agriculture, and I am sure the Government would lose no money if they undertook this project. All they need is courage and enterprise, and they would find these little farms would be successful and would give a fresh impetus to agriculture. It was thought in the early days that the thing would be practicable, and there was some co-operation between the honourable gentleman (Mr. Burrell) and the Minister of Agriculture for Nova Scotia. Some start was made in the buying of old farms but the matter was not looked after properly and nothing of importance has really been done. What is absolutely e* sential for the development of the country is that it shall be a place in which the ordinary man can live in comfort, and the only way in which that can be achieved is to encourage the farmer to produce and enable him to sell at reasonable prices. The only advantage to the farmer is the profit he makes, and if he can make a large\nprofit it is better for the country. He may make a fair profit on a small quantity, but if he can make a proportionate profit on large quantities of produce there is a beneficial result all round. It is absolutely necessary for the Department of Agriculture to make a departure from the rut in which we have been moving for the last twenty-five years, and to show what can be done along these lines. I have no particular line to indicate to the minister, but I have suggested what might be done in the neighbourhood of large centres. I have spoken of Cape Breton because I know men there who are ready to take hold of these little farms if they are put within their reach. They have not the means themselves to buy lands and put up houses, but if they were helped up to that stage they would jump at the proposition. The market is there and they could sell their produce, and there are young men from the Old Country who are enterprising enough to do very well if they were given a start. Another thing I might point out is the desirability of encouraging the extension of tram cars that are in touch with agricultural land so as to encourage the farmer. Companies might be encouraged to push their lines into the country. These things cost money, but the minister in charge of the department must have courage to depart from the old line and not hesitate to spend money abundantly so long as good results can be obtained. We want to make 'Canada produce something proportionate to its capacity for production.\nMr. iLEiMIEUX: In connection with the distribution of literature, I have noticed that literature is printed in both languages and when any one applies to the department he can get either French or English copies. I want to inform the minister-and this can be confirmed by the deputy minister-that the best agent of the department in my province is the cure, who is generally the honorary president and sometimes the secretary of what we call the Circles Agricoles. There is one in every county, and sometimes one in every parish, and in the pulpit on nearly every 'Sunday of the year in these rural districts the cure will spend a portion of his time speaking to the farmers on agricultural matters.\nI would like my hon. friend to send the literature which is issued by the department in French-not all, but the most essential bulletins-to the cures of the province of Quebec, so as to secure their devotion to the cause. Because the great issue of the day is the necessity of getting our"", ""people back to the land and improving living conditions in the rural districts. I have offered these remarks now because unfortunately, I shall not be able to be present this evening.\nMr. 'CRERAR:\tI can say to the hon.\ngentleman that the suggestion which he has made will be acted upon.\nAt six o'clock the House resumed and took recess.\nAfter Kecess.\nThe House resumed at eight o'clock.""]",,,,

Under present conditions my experience has been, not working in this line of work as a hobby but rather as a business, that it costs at least from $150 to $200 to produce a yearling bull. If that price or even a bare advance on that may seem rather high to the purchaser of the animal, still when that animal is taken into a herd of twenty or thirty cows, the improvement in the first year, or at least by the second year, will easily pay for the initial outlay. For the man who is unable to pay out that much money for a sire, the Government has made it easy to get one through the plan which has been described to-night. Ten men can get together and secure the services of a sire. In British Columbia this has worked with great advantage, particularly in districts along the line of the Grand Trunk Pacific and other isolated places where settlers have just gone in, where they have not got their farms cleaned up and where they are too poor to pay for a sire. Under ordinary circumstances in ten years from now these men would still be breeding scrub cattle; but by being afforded an opportunity of securing the services of a pure-bred sire under this plan, in five or ten years they have a fine lot of high-grade cattle worth far more money than the scrub cattle would be, and in addition to that ten men have been educated to the value of using pure-bred sires. When they are able to buy sires in future they will prefer to buy pure-breds instead of grades. While our live stock in Canada is worth a great deal of money and while we have made certain advances, we are still in our swad-dli g clothes as regards possible developments. It will be generally admitted that the quality of beef in this country is inferior when compared with that of Australia or of the Argentine Republic. It has, however, been proved on one or two occasions that we are quite capable of producing beef of first-class quality. I might cite the case of one or two Ontario breeders who have been able to take steers down to the great International show in Chicago and win the sweepstakes there in competition with the whole continent. On another occasion, Mr. James D. McGregor, of Brandon, Manitoba, took down a steer one year and won the sweepstakes, and the next
190}
year he took down a full brother of the first one and won the sweepstakes again, the only occasion when that was done by a single feeder or breeder. I am credibly informed that our beef, as we produce it, is very much inferior to that of the Argentine, as I have described, and that their average run of chilled beef placed on the market in the old country is equal to the average run of our Christmas beef to be found on the markets of this country. I am ialso informed that in the inspected abattoirs of Canada not more than 10 per cent of beef that is passed through is fit to export to the old country in competition with beef from the other countries I have mentioned. This shows that we have a vast field for improvement which can only be made by the use of pure-bred sires, and then by proper feeding and finishing before our animals are sent to the market. The Argentine stock raisers have never hesitated to pay high prices for bulls, in fact *they go into the markets of Great Britain and pay more than the stock raisers of any other country, and they have recently paid as high as $30,000 for a single animal. In that country you will fine herds of from 1,000 to 3,000 head very uniform throughout, whereas in this country you would find a few hundred really good animals and the rest would be very ordinary, showing that there is a great deal to be done in the improvement of beef cattle in Canada. How this should be done is a matter for deep consideration by the officials of our Department of Agriculture. One way to do it would be to begin at the bottom by inducing stock raisers to breed better animals and put them on the market in better condition. To do this there is no better plan that I know of than to offer liberal prizes at our fat stock shows and live stock exhibitions. This plan has been carried out for many years at 'Chicago, and the quality of the beef has steadily improved. In addition to this the man who has a carload of beef in better finished condition to offer for sale will receive two or three cents a pound more than the man who has his beef in an unfinished state.
Coming to dairy cattle, I cannot pass without drawing the attention of the committee to the fact that one of our Canadian breeders, Mr. I. B. Hanmer, of Norwich, Ontario, has recently bred a cow which has broken the world's record, having produced just under 52 pounds of butter in seven days. Hon. members will realize what achievement this cow has made when they take into consideration the fact that the average dairy cow of Canada would not pro-

duce more than about one pound per day, while this cow averaged between seven and eight pounds per day. We have in this country cattle that have produced over 30,-(000 pounds of milk in one year. The average dairy cow of Canada produces less than 4,000 pounds, showing what a splendid field for improvement there is, and this can be accomplished only by the use of pure-bred sires and also by feeding in a way such as I have described and by the dissemination of agricultural education.
Coming to sheep, I think this country is in a most disgraceful condition. We have less than 3,000,000 sheep in the whole of the Dominion as compared with 90,000,000 to 100,000,000 in Australia and about 40,000,000 in Great Britain. Here is an excellent opportunity to develop a valuable industry, an industry that will be valuable not only to the straight stock farmer but to the grain farmer of the West in keeping down weeds. Sheep are a class of live stock that can be produced very largely on the waste material that is to be found on the farm.
The condition of our pork products is very satisfactory. A report was brought back by Mr. Arkell to the effect that Canadian bacon now stands very high on the British market. The Britishers apparently did not begin to realize how good our Canadian bacon was until they had been forced to eat the fat bacon that is produced in the United States, and it behooves the Department of Agriculture to use the utmost care to see that this market is developed in every possible way and also that we send over only first-class material so that we can retain the market and build up a splendid outlet for Canadian live stock products in the future.
I think that the stimulation of the use of pure bred sires all over the country is most important. Just as long as we use scrub sires and do not care whether we improve our -cattle or not, we shall be moving around in a circle and shall not get anywhere; but if an intelligent system is followed, and pushed to the fullest extent, I am sure we shall get excellent results. I commend the department for the action they are taking. I know they have a number of live officials who are working along these lines and I am sure a great deal can be accomplished by following the course I have outlined.

ANDREWS (Centre Winnipeg):,,J006 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, when the election was on, a year and a half ago, it was my privilege to address an audience of Winnipeg workingmen on the subject of winning the war. The issue at that time was quite clear cut. I told them I was a candidate for the Union Government and as such stood for the conscription of men. I pointed out that this meant the particular men I was talking to. I also told them that I stood for the conscription of money, which meant their money, and for the conscription of the last dollar and the last man in Canada, if need be, to win this war. That was pretty straight talking. When I got through one of the men got up and said: ""Well, we understand exactly what you mean now."" 1 told them I would not think of going over the top with men who were not prepared to go all the way. When the 17th December came they knew exaotly what it meant for the men who were going to the war. When the election was over, in spite of the fact that my opponent was the secretary of the labour union, it was found that they had voted for me in the proportion of three to one.
These are the men who, -to-day, are on strike. There is certainly something wrong somewhere. In addition to those men, as good and as loyal citizens as Canada evei had, there are many of my own comrades who stood in the trenches in France; they are on strike. I say, standing in my place here, that in my opinion eighty per cent of the returned men of Winnipeg are in sympathy with the strikers and the object of this strike.
On the first of May the men of the metal trades went on strike, partly because the masters refused an eight-hour day and a larger hour wage but chiefly because of their employers' refusal to recognize theii union. The building trade employees presented their schedule to the masters who frankly admitted its fairness and reasonableness, but declared their inability to meet the demand. Here we have the two vital causes of the strike (1) a living wage, and (2) the right to organize. This is the cause of the strike in my opinion after the most careful consideration and
5 p.m. after using every means in my power to find out the facts. When the ironmasters let it become known that they were going to make it a trial of endurance, the trades and labour council called for a sympathetic strike of all organized labour in the city. A vote was taken and all unions, including public utilities, came out.
As to the blame, I accuse no one, I judge no man, but the fact remains that the men are on strike and that is a fact that we must not forget. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the labour unions in Winnipeg in all good faith, in the month of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and nineteen, were forced to strike for a living wage and for the right to organize. So far as the living wage is concerned, I think hon. members will agree that if ever a .strike is justifiable it is for a living wage for the striker and his family. With regard to the right to organize, there was a time when a combination of employees was accounted conspiracy and treated as such but to-day it cannot be denied to those whose saleable commodity is labour, the free right to say what terms they will sell their labour at; how much of it they will sell, and whether they will sell it for six or for twelve hours a day. The days of serfdom in Canada have passed. Nor can their right be denied to agree together as to the price at which they will sell their labour and the quantity of labour they have to sell, so long as this right is granted to any other class in the community.
The single workman is helpless against the great corporation; the individual union or craft is equally so. Collective bargaining is the logical outcome of organization and it is now too late in the day for any corporation to refuse it-that principle is embodied as one of the provisions of the

charter of labour formed by the League of Nations.
The sympathetic strike is the natural and logical sequence of organization. What more natural than that men who have interests in common should stand together in an emergency? A particular union or craft in striking may be striking for a principle that is absolutely vital to every man in the industry and just as the employers can down one single man so they can down a single union unless all stand together. This is co-operation; it is brotherhood, and it is absolutely the same principle of sticking together that was employed in France. Twenty-seven allied nations had a sympathetic strike, and they won. That sympathetic strike brings one naturally to the ""One Big Union,"" and here again Of believe is an entirely logical and absolute sequence of organization. If you once permit men to organize, and by their organization to deliberately make the boss ""come through"" with something with which he does not agree, that is force, and there is no other word for it; and the ""One Big Union"" is a logical way of fighting. It took us a long time to fight it out in France, but we did fight it out eventually, and once we got ""the One Big Union"" and ""the One Big Foch"" we won the war; and in the case of labour unions that is a logical conclusion once you begin to strike. I do not believe in strikes, but we have them in Canada. Having got them, there is need for the application of intelligence in their settlement. Once you have got labour lined up on one side you find there will also line up the Bankers' Association, the Manufacturers' Association, and all the other representatives of employers, and there is likely to be a first-rate fight. A little fight has been started already, and it will be ""a real proper one"" if we do not have a change soon. There are only two ways of settling disputes, as far as I know, one by arbitration and the other by force; and there is no more reason for the strike that is going on in Winnipeg to-day than there is for myself and any hon. member of this House who had a difference of opinion, going out on the lawn in front of this building and settling that difference with bombs; we should both of us be regarded as criminal lunatics if we did that. I have heard some criminal lunatics advance suggestions in connection with the settlement of this strike, and the sooner those persons are in the ""jug"" the better it will be.
In speaking along these lines it has been my experience that in military matters you

will find in every platoon, every company, every battalion, and every regiment, men that are termed ""roughnecks""-fellows that f you do not run them they will run you; and it appears to me that we have some of this class at large in Canada to-day. There is no question that if we do not do something to curb them they will run this Government and the country as well. We have got farmers' organizations, soldiers' organizations, 'and God knows what other bodies, all lining up for a fight, and I think it is about time that the members of Parliament, the representatives of all the people in Canada, had something to say in the matter. Let us have a little constitutional government; I have heard too much about organization and that sort of thing to please me. When a man begins to organize he is preparing to fight. I stand for arbitration and not for war in industrial relations as well as international relations. The Prime Minister the other day declared that if we could not settle this little business of our own it boded ill for a League of Nations. I think it does. I would suggest, if I may, that a national industrial conference should be called at once. In the meantime this striking has got to be stopped; if it does not stop one side or the other will win. I do not know which side will be the winner, I am playing no favourites, but I do know that the work people in Winnipeg are determined to win if they can. If they do not win they will starve, they will go back to their work with a bitter feeling. There are men on strike to-day that were repulsed by the Germans three years ago, but that did not end the war. The principle at stake is one of absolute force, as far as I see it, and I would like to see that changed. It can be changed, it is being done every day. If we cannot settle the problem I think it is time we got out and let somebody else have a go. In that respect I agree with an hon. gentleman who has spoken this afternoon.
There is another point I want to touch upon for a moment or two. Twice this afternoon I have heard tne term "" Bolsheviks "" applied to the strike leaders in Winnipeg. Gentlemen, if you apply the term to those men you apply it to me, 'because they are my friends. There is a man called James Winning, a good level-headed Scotchman, who has spent practically all his life working for his fellowmen. The only erratic thing he has done in tms agitation has been closing down the press and participating in the strike. As to the press, I had the misfortune to hear an hon. gentleman, one of the oldest members in the chamber, state

his opinion that the press was corrupt, and he was not called a "" Bolshevik "" for saying that. If ever a strike by workingmen in newspaper offices was justified it was in this case if the newspapers were not playing the game. There is another man called Russell in Winnipeg. Russell is a Socialist and not a man who advocates force. I know tnese men, and for them force would be absolutely the last resource. Russell wants a change. So does Robinson, so does Simpson, and so does Rigg. They want a change because they are not satisfied with present conditions. How many hon. gentlemen in this House are satisfied? I venture to say many of them would welcome a change of government.

LAPOINTE:,,J006 COMMONS,,,"Quite true, the officers of the Great War veterans proclaimed their neutrality. But it is also true that the returned soldiers by thousands have evinced their sympathy with the strikers of Winnipeg. In order to try to show that the strikers are animated by Bolshevistic ideals, much is said of their having issued their famous licenses with the words, "" By leave of the strike committee."" The strikers had no right (to do this, Mr. Speaker. Such a usurpation of power cannot be tolerated in any constitutional country. They made a mistake, and they seem to have realized it, because they have discontinued that course of action. But is that a sign of Bolshevism and disloyalty? The first city in any British country which gave such an example was the city of Belfast. A few months ago when the gas and electricity workers joined the strike, Belfast went without light except so far as the strike committee gave leave to relax their prohibition in that regard. Yet nobody will gainsay that Belfast is a loyal city. It is the loyal city 'par excellence-it is the
[Mr .E. Lapointe.]
capital of loyalism. Belfast is so deeply and profoundly British that the mere prospect of self government being given to Ireland kindled the flames of rebellion four years ago. The strikers at Belfast were wrong when they arrogated that right to themselves; so were the strikers at Winnipeg; but the latter are not more antiBritish or disloyal than the former.
With regard to the action of the Government in trying to effect a settlement of the strike, it has been rather' unfortunate. Senator Robertson seems to have sided with one party to the struggle, and obviously his usefulness as a mediator is gone, and I do not wonder that he is on his way back to Ottawa. His last performance in sending an appeal to Mr. Gompers, the head of the American Federation of Labour, is a most extraordinary one. Here is that despatch as I find it in the Montreal Star:
Samuel Gompers,
President of the American Federation of Labour,
Washington.
May 29.-A general sympathetic strike involving some ninety-five unions was called in the City of Winnipeg for May 15, resulting in a complete tie up of all business and declaration by iStrike Committee of control over civic affairs as well as interference with provincial and federal employees.
As is the case in all general strikes of this nature it has already defeated itself, but I feel it proper to say to you after toeing on the ground for several days that in my opinion the prestige and authority of international unions whose endeavouring, to embroil their members in other cities in sympathetic strikes in support of the lost cause here, should receive the earnest and serious consideration of the executives of the various organizations concerned, particularly of what is know as the metal trades.
The underlying motive in calling the strike is undoubtedly in support of what is known as the ""One Big Union,"" movement and which has for its purpose the destruction of the international trades unions if possible. Will you give this matter your personal attention and communicate with the executives of the various internationals as you may desem desirable.
This is an appeal, clamouring for help, by a Canadian minister of the Crown to a foreign labour leader.
.More humiliating action on the part of a responsible minister in a British country has never before been witnessed, and I hope may never be witnessed again. It stands as a monument to the statesmanship and national ideals of that combine of the best brains of the country which was once gathered together in Canada by some sort of collective bargaining under the name of Union Government.
I have no hesitation in saying that the Acting Minister of Justice (Mr. .Meighen)

was the last man in the world who should have been selected to act as conciliator or mediator. Nobody has more admiration than I have for the ability and talent of the minister, but his temperament, mentality and training disqualify him altogether for the difficult task of mediator. He stands in Canada as the Apostle of arbitrary enactments and despotic legislation. He is the father of the closure in this House. His Italian hand may be discerned in the War-time Elections Act, that nefarious piece of legislation which is still a blot on the statute books of Canada. If there exists in some quarters of the country a feeling of distrust of Parliament and Parliamentary institutions, I believe the Acting Minister of Justice is one of those who are largely responsible for it. Be that as it may, he is so considered by quite a number of people in the country, and he will not be welcomed and trusted by those people as a fair mediator. When, a few weeks ago, I moved in this House that labour should be given representation on the Board of Directors of the Canadian National Railways, it was the Acting Minister of Justice who said in reply that I was favouring a very unsound, principle. He was unable to understand that employees of a railway have an interest in the system different from and larger than the interest of the rest of the community. Yet the principle of allowing labour a share in the management of industry is accepted to-day and advocated by both employers and employees in Great Britain and the United States as the best way to enlist the whole soul and energy of the workingman in the thing he is doing. Individual employers in that respect have been ahead of legislation and universal practice. They have set an example which has, in all cases, been most successful. Why does not the Government of Canada set an example in this country? Why refuse a reasonable concession now and be forced to grant it afterwards? The Government may yet grant it so that such concession of a fair demand shall not take on the appearance of a surrender on the one side and a triumph on the other. I do not wonder that the labour men of Winnipeg could not consider my hon. friend as being able to enter into their minds sympathetically, in order to discover their ideals, aims and desires.
But the situation is becoming more serious every day, in spite of ministerial optimistic announcements we have daily at the opening of the House and the interested denials in the newspapers. Still I ask: What shall we do? What shall the Government do? The Mathers' Commission does not possess the authority or prestige that would give its report or its finding a large degree of influence. It is by no means representative. As was stated in the last issue of Maclean's Magazine by a member of the Press Gallery, it could hardly be considered as a satisfactory camouflage, and that was all it was intended to be. The commission was told in all the cities: "" There is something rotten in the state of Denmark."" We all knew that. Why does not the Government issue a call for a large national conference of employers and employees, as was done in England? If labour in Canada acts as labour acts in England, why should not Canadian statesmanship be able to follow the example of British statesmanship? Let such a conference be called and let labour select its own representative. When a man is selected by the Government to represent labour on a committee, or commission, or conference of some kind, that man does not properly represent labour; he represents the Government. I have the fullest confidence that the Canadian employers and employees could find a common ground and agree together as British employers and employees have succeeded in doing. In the meantime, as a token of goodwill, could not Parliament and the Government agree to have a labour representative on the Board of Directors of the Canadian National railways?
The Government states that it has no power to enact eight-hour day legislation. I admit there is grave doubt as to that, but there is no doubt that the Government can enact eight-hour day legislation as to its own public works, and such legislation would go a long way towards securing the general adoption of that reform. Something must be done quickly to endeavour to convert class struggle into class harmony, to convert retaliation into reciprocity. But Mr. Speaker, I believe the Government has already delayed too long. Something must be done now, and these are my concluding words to the Government: Do something and do it now.

BURNHAM (Peterborough West):,,J006 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, perhaps I may be allowed to contribute a little something to what I consider in my humble way as the basis of this industrial unrest. I do not purpose indulging in personalities, nor in blaming any body for not having unearthed some solution of a problem that confronts the entire world, nor do I purpose discussing various theories which have been advanced from time to time as solutions of the problem. But I will go to what 1

consider the very root of the matter, namely, the ability of the workingman to maintain himsel'f at the present rate of wages. I firmly believe that if he had the wages which would enable him to live properly and comfortably, he would be satisfied, and if he were satisfied, you could not possibly stir him into any form of unrest.
Some few days ago I asked the Acting Minister of Labour (Mr. A. K. Maclean) if he would be kind enough to answer a question regarding this. After several days he very kindly answered the question and put the answer into printed form which was served upon me to-day. It is headed: "" The high cost of living and minimum wages/' and it reads:
Re Mr. Burnham's Inquiry of May 28, Hansard1 for May 28 shows the following: statement:
Mr. J. H. Burnham (Peterborough West) : J would like to ask the Acting Minister of Labour (Hon. A. IC. Maclean) what is the weekly budget for the average Canadian family as found by the latest report of the Department of Labour; and what is the minimum weekly wage to correspond with that weekly minimum budget ?
This was the reply:
Regarding the point raised by Mr. Burnham it may be stated that the weekly family budget printed in the ""Labour Gazette"" is given as a typical family budget, not as a minimum family budget. The figures as. printed do not vary from month to month or from year to year. The object aimed at in printing the budget is not to indicate in any way what commodities should be purchased but to facilitate an effective comparison of prices at different periods so that the relative purchasing power of money may be shown. The weekly budget printed in the "" Labour Gazette "" was framed by the Dominion Statistician some years ago and the foods enumerated and the quantities specified go to make up the number of calories estimated as necessary for a family of five,- husband, wife and three children ; save that so far as the workman is concerned the budget is intended rather to meet the case of a man engaged in somewhat severe manual labour, the food allowance being therefore slightly larger than would be necessary if the man were engaged in clerical or other light employment. The figures printed from month to month in the ""Labour Gazette"" show the cost of the same quantities of the same class of commodity, the prices ranging over a number of years. The budget includes prices as to foods, fuel and rent and dries not include clothing. Clothing is of course an essential part of the cost of living but the subject is one which cannot be easily reflected by statistics, the articles covering so wide a range and the conditions varying so greatly as between different families, different localities and different periods. In considering the family budget as printed in the ""Labour Gazette"" an addition of from twenty-five to forty per cent must be made for clothes and miscellaneous articles.
Regarding the latter part of Mr. Burnham's question re minimum weekly wage, it may be stated that just as there is no minimum bud-

get known to the Department of Labour neither is there any weekly minimum wage known to the department, save that during the past year or two different provinces have enacted minimum wage laws as to some classes of labour. Wages are, as a rule, fixed for each calling and the minimum wage varies greatly as between one calling and another and as between one city and another. The family budget as printed in the ""Labour Gazette"" is, it may be added, much used by employers and employees in measuring the fluctuations of living and is therefore of material value in effecting wage agreements in different trades. Attached is a copy of the family budget as printed in the May, 1919, issue of the ""Labour Gazette."" Attached is memorandum showing food prices for Great Britain, United States and Canada, respectively, for the month of February.
The copy of the family budget attached for staple foods, fuel, light and rent, in terms of the average prices in 66 Canadian cities, shows the cost per week 'to ""be $21.34. That budget does not include anything for clothing, for which I have allowed only the moderate sum of $2 per week. It includes nothing for medicine and medical attendance, for which I have allowed $1 per week. It includes nothing for boots and shoes, for which I have allowed 50 cents per week; nothing for headgear, for which I have allowed 10 cents per week; nothing for religion, for which I have allowed the modest sum of 25 cents per week; nothing for amusement s, for which I have allowed 25 cents a week; nothing foT education, for which I have allowed 25 cents a week, (because although education is free in some provinces there are incidental expenses); nothing for insurance for which I have allowed 50 cents per week; making a total of $4.80 not allowed for. This added to the $21.34 makes a total of $26.14, or an average of $4.35 per day for six days in the week which the man engaged in severe toil must earn or he cannot meet this necessary budget. Even then nothing is allowed for the instruments of labour, the tools which the workman must have, and nothing is provided for old age. When ve consider the wage the workingman is receiving at the present time, he is away behind this budget. The Government has worked very hard investigating these prices, and its figures, which are given in the most candid manner, show that $4.50 per day- '$5 per day including provision for old age and tools-is the minimum wage which the labouring man in Canada should receive today. But he receives nothing like that, and it naturally follows that there is very great unrest. He does not know, very few of us did, that this was what the budget amounted to; but there are the figures given by the 'Government, in answer to my question, after

several days' delay, and they show that the workingman is away behind. He is going down lower and lower in the scale, and his [DOT]weekly and yearly deficit is becoming most alarming. Restlessness must follow as a matter of course. I do not think for one *moment that the employer can pay more than he is paying at the present time and make things go. I do not claim that there is any inequality whatever in the scale of prices relative to each other. I am simply accounting for the unrest among the masses of the people of this country. To urge that free trade or anything of that description will remedy matters is not to argue by the book.

I am somewhat surprised at the great anxiety of the Opposition to precipitate this debate to-day, instead of waiting until Wednesday, as I had planned. Of course, we must appreciate their kindly interest in the strikes in Winnipeg and elsewhere, but I wish to recall the fact that last year, when a much more serious condition, riot and bloodshed existed in Quebec City, not one of the members now so insistent, rose to support the motion of the hon. member from Simcoe to discuss those serious disturbances which existed at that time. I hope, Mr. Speaker, this discussion will be of a moderate nature and in character entirely constructive, which will have a tendency to allay the prevailing unrest and be of some assistance to the Government in its efforts to formulate a policy which will effectively deal with

the situation. II hope the tariff is not unduly blamed for all the high cost of living and unrest, as I am informed that barring probably New Zealand, the cost of living is lower in Canada than it is in any other country in the world. Mackenzie King in his booklet "" The Four Parties to Industry,"" starts out by saying the truth must be arrived at, and the truth shall set us free from fear of the future and shall aid in the enforcement of that social justice which the truth demands.
Canada stands to win more out of this war than any other nation of the world, provided we are fully united in taking the full measure of the opportunities afforded. The eyes of the world are upon Canada. Her sons have done as good fighting, and I think I might safely say the best fighting in this Great War, that has been done on any of the 37 different battle fronts. Industries must needs flock here to a country whose natural resources are so great and opportunities almost unlimited. Canada is confronted with the opportunity of developing more in the next ten years than probably she has in the last fifty years. But, that development cannot be expected to take place unless we have industrial peace.
When we see a patient we must first make a diagnosis and then proceed with the treatment. At the very .bottom of this unrest lies misunderstanding and distrust and jealousy. If we define industry as King does in his little book-and I would commend its perusal to hon. members-we get this definition:
Industry is the means by which the material resources of the world are transformed, through human intelligence and human energy, with the aid of natural powers, tools, and machines, into commodities and services available for human use. It is a vast process of transformation, itself a series of transforming- processes so inter-rclated and numerous as to unite mankind, in this age of world-wide industrial expansion, in an enterprise that encompasses the globe.
The four parties to industry he defines as labour, capital, management and the community. We have heretofore been inclined to regard labour and capital as the two factors of industry, leaving out both management and the community. This is King's definition of the community:
It is the community which provides the natural resources and powers that underlie all production. Individuals may acquire title by one means or another, hut it is from the community, and with the consent of the community, that titles are held. It is the community, organized in various ways, which maintains government and foreign relations, secures law and
order, fosters the arts and inventions, aids education, breeds opinion, and promotes, through concession or otherwise, the agencies of transportation, communication, credit, banking, and the like, without which any production, save the most primitive, would be impossible. It is the community which creates the demand for commodities and services, through which labour is provided with remunerative employment, and capital with a return upon its investment. Apart from the community, inventive genius, organizing capacity, managerial or other ability would be of little value. Turn where one may, it is the community that makes possible all the activities of industry, and helps to determine their value and scope.
Labour must fully appreciate its responsibility to capital and the State, -and capital must as fully appreciate its responsibility to labour and the State. The tired feeling is abroad in this land. Nobody seems to want to work. In many industries, I am told, only 40. per cent to 60 per cent of efficiency is produced. This is not fully appreciating the responsibility to capital and the State.
The aim and object of many of the workingmen to-day seems to be to get the most possible money for the least possible expenditure of energy. The tramp says the world owes him a living, and he is going to get it. I hope we are not coming as a nation to the same status as the tramp.
One may well wonder that capital takes no more interest in labour than it is now doing. For nearly 100 years workmen and employers have been organizing, and as yet we do not find a full understanding between the four parties interested in industry. We seem to be much in need of reconstruction in our industrial life. 'Some people have defined reconstruction as restoration; others demolition and reconstruction from the ground up. Between these extremes stands a majority which interprets readjustment as restoration, with more oi less modification, the degree of modification varying considerably, hut' the structure of pre-war days being in its essentials retained.
I have seen both capital and labour abuse their privileges. I had an opportunity of spending two winters in the lumber camp"" of Northern Ontario. During the first winter 1906-7-lumber was at a premium, prices were good, and labour was in great demand, but the labourers were not producing anything like their maximum. If the foreman said a single word to them of complaint or reprimand they would walk ovei to another camp of the same firm and get work. The next year there was not much demand for lumber, and one firm which had intended operating a large number of

That winter I saw them bring down labourers from Winnipeg and charge them 3 cents a mile for the trip, and also charge them high prices for their supplies, and when the company were about even with the boys they gave the latter their time and told them to hit the trail. Men who had walked twenty-five miles to lumber camps were told there was no employment .for them and they might go. Both parties during those winters abused their privileges and did not show any friendly spirit towards one another.
One of the chief ways that a solution of this difficulty and ill feeling that exists between capital and labour, or rather, misunderstanding, can be blotted out, is by each appreciating more fully the interests of the other. Labour cannot go on without capital, nor capital without labour. A process of education must be entered into, and probably, as charity begins at home, we could well spend a few minutes criticising the Postal Department. As I said on the floor of this House there would have been no strike at Winnipeg had the protests of the men been paid more attention to last year by the Deputy Postmaster General. I am provided by some unknown person with a clipping from the Financial Post of Toronto. It starts off on the loose management of the post office and is a tirade-a great deal of which is justified-against the Deputy Postmaster General, who is probably doing better now, but last year he was not fully appreciating his responsibilities towards the employees. Both employers and employees must be educated as to their responsibilities to the State. Garretson, who is head of the railway conductors, says:
An army of unemployed is being created that must in the last analysis be reckoned with and unless a remedy is found whereby incentive may be restored and recompense made apparent, society itself must pay the forfeit.
Lord Brassey in his book on Work and Wages refers to certain railway labourers whose wages were raised from 2 shillings to 2 shillings and 6 pence and then to 3 shillings a day, and he states that they produced work more cheaply at the higher wages than at the lower. The same thing occurred on the Metropolitan drainage system, London, while in India when the wages were increased, the employees lay down bn the job and would only work enough to give them a living. Some courts must be established to deal with their difficulties.

The Whitley plan in England has been productive of allaying much of the unrest in that country. One of its aims was to make and consider suggestions for securing a permanent improvement in the relations between employers and workmen, to recommend means for securing that industrial conditions affecting relations between employers and workmen shall be systematically adjusted by those concerned with a view of improving conditions in the future. The circumstances ait the present time are admitted on all sides to offer a great opportunity for securing a permanent improvement in the relations between employers and employees, while failure to utilize the opportunity may involve ithe nation in grave and great industrial difficulties. This should be a move in the right direction to improve the conditions of 'the working people
Heretofore, as after the South African War, and during the industrial depression say of 1907-1908, people were left to hustle for themselves and make the best of the conditions which existed at that time.
The community seems to be now more alive to its responsibilities, and more care is being taken to alleviate the suffering that is bound to follow after this great crisis. The Whitley report suggests a triple organization starting in the workshops and extending into the districts and the nation. The object is to secure co-operation bv granting to working people a greater share in the consideration of matters affecting the industry in which they work. This can be achieved only by keeping employers and working people in constant touch. The report aims to deal with the better utilization of the practical knowledge and experience of the work people, and to establish methods of negotiating issues arising between employers and working people, with a view both to the provisions to discuss them and to the better adjustment of them when they appear. It also aims to deal with industrial research; utilization of inventions; improvements of processes; proposed legislation affecting the industries, but above all-the fullest measure of cooperation between employers and employees. The report is very pronounced on this last, it being mentioned three or four times. It is very insistent in bringing forward the fullest measure of co-operation and in stimulating such between employer and employee. The councils in their work ol promoting the interests of their own industries will have regard for the national interest. This is a point that should not

be overlooked in even the smallest industry in the country.
There should be adequate organization on the part of both employer's and work people. We hope that representative men in each industry, with pride in their calling and care for its place as a contributor to the national well-being, will come together in the manner here suggested and apply themselves to promoting industrial harmony and in removing the obstacles that have hitherto stood in the way. It is contemplated that agreements reached should carry with them the same application of observances as exists in the case of other agreements between employers' associations and trade unions. That point should be carefully studied. We have fought in this war for what was termed by the Germans as a scrap of paper. We have in Winnipeg an instance where civic employees had gone out on strike, as the Minister of Labour said, almost before the ink on the agreement was dry. Agreements should be binding and that proposition cannot be too emphatically laid down. There will never be a court whose decisions will please every one; yet there must be some tribunal to settle disputes, whose decisions when rendered are final. In this age and generation it should not be found necessary to strike in order to settle disputes. It has always amused me to see people strike, and then arrive at a settlement and go back to work. Probably neither side is completely satisfied. Some tribunal such as a district council or the men's own union should have settled the matter if both parties had played fair. In every particular, from welfare to wages, immediate results will depend upon the temper and degree of enlightenment of employers and employees. The old saying of employers during a depression, when many men lined up at their offices day after day seeking employment-it is our turn now-should be a thing of the past. The majority of employers, in my opinion, have a new outlook and a greater willingness to concede the existence of a viewpoint other than their own and not to regard theiT business an autocracy and themselves the rulers.
In New Zealand a Board of Trade has been appointed by the Government to investigate and report on conditions, trade prices, cost of living, etc., in that Dominion, and to enforce the Commercial Trusts Act of 1910. If I am correctly informed, this board had a dispute with some merchants; it took over two of the stores and ran them for one year losing one-fifth oi
a cent per pound on the meat, It was however, able to stabilize prices and arrive at a new basis on which the men could carry along. In dealing with the problem of the cost of living, the Board reported that the fixing of prioes was a remedy that could be applied only with the greatest of care, as the supply might greatly diminish, it not cease entirely, so that prices should not be fixed except in the case of commodities of which the whole supply could be controlled from the field of production to the final consumer, the intermediary changes being limited to fair remuneration for services rendered. By such means little could be done to keep down the prices of products imported from abroad. It also recommended that steps should be taken to control the manufacture and sale oi goods that might be considered as luxuries as valuable labour was expended on these which should be diverted to the production of essential commodities. In New York State a personnel of Managers' Club has been established whose objects are the methods of promoting good relations and industrial peace. They seem to be standing with reluctant feet at a point of departure from familiar paths-their faces turned in the right direction, but themselves not ready to go 'Confidently forward.
It is a seriously debatable question how long any amount of amelioration in industrial relations with structural changes in the social edifice will suffice to keep the working people or population in a state of reasonable contentment. In Canada we have a Boyal Commission investigating industrial conditions and the other day a committee was appointed to inquire into prices. When their reports are brought down, I have no doubt they will form a basis on which 'the Government may take action.
War has been a ferment, a tremendous power the action of which cannot yet be fully determined. Victorious people have always been a complacent people, but this war seems to have furnished a variation. People are thinking differently. It is estimated in the States there are 800,000 revolutionary union workers. The world is living in fear of a thing called Bolshevism. Force will not destroy it, no ring of armed men can stay the fusion of its subtle poison, where injustice makes misery and misery makes desperation. Employers must prove their case and their intentions to the working people and to the community. WTe must have justice. The text of justice must rest in its inclusiveness, it must be just to all men. Brain and brawn should each receive the full value of work done. Decent",,,,

It is the belief that the employer benefits disproportionately by increased production that causes conflict. I have heard it said that men in the shop say: What do we care whether we produce more? It does not do any benefit to us because we get our pay just the same. All work is not equal in value, and the rewards should not be equal. Justice must take this course by orderly procedure with the utmost rapidity possible.
During the war we considered that cooperation between employers and employees was a national duty and privilege. The war was but a transient affair, and this feeling of national duty and privilege shouiu be me more applied in times of peace. The National Association of Employers in the United States lays down fair dealing as a fundamental and basic principle on which relations between employers and employees should rest. Misunderstandings must be eradicated. The Golden Rule may be hard to apply in business, but it should not be impossible of application. It is quite different from the old saying "" Business is business,"" and that justifies everything that strays from the Golden Rule. The trouble to-day with labour is that it is being misled in the West. The revolutionary and socialistic elements seem to be in the control. In Winnipeg, I am told, that only 8,000 voted for the general strike, which has recently taken place. Many men join the unions to make life more pleasant for themselves in their shop and then pay little attention to the elections and the choice of leaders.
I have here a copy of the Western Labour News, Special Strike Edition No. 5, printed on May 22, which gives a list of 58 unions that are on strike. It says that the partial vote as reported Wednesday morning showed only 8,000 in favour of the general strike and 600 against it. I will lay this paper on the table of the House so that hon. members may see that these contentions are taken from Labour's own paper. Men who are earning $70 per month in wages are out oh strike in Winnipeg for men earning $160 and $170. The fact that only 8,000 voted for the general strike, while 35,000 are out on strike, backs up my contention that the labourers are not taking a proper interest in their unions and in the election of their leaders.
The heart of Labour is all right, but many of the leaders are all wrong. The Minister

of Labour says he has no doubt that while the strike in Winnipeg arose over a definition of collective bargaining, it was at heart really an attempt at revolution and the establishment of a Soviet government. To use the words of the Winnipeg Citizen ""it was not a strike, but plain, ugly revolution"". To back up that point I lay on the table of the House the Winnipeg Citizen, which quotes as follows from the Western Labour News of April 25:
The Russian Soviet System.
Was worked out from the blue print from which this reproduction (the diagram) was made. The western Labour News has, it is believed, the only copy on the American continent. It will pay you to vote for the ""One Big Union.""
This quotation from the official organ of the Labour party at Winnipeg shows that the Minister of Labour w-as quite right when he said that this was not a strike but a plain, ugly revolution. Many of the leaders in Winnipeg have openly during the past year declared that they would soon take over the industries and run them themselves. On the second day of the strike, one of (the leaders was reported to have proclaimed that Winnipeg was controlled by the Soviet. One alderman is reported to have said to the Mayor in the Council Chamber, "" What are you giving us? We can run the city, we're running it now."" The labour leaders in Winnipeg are telling the men that if this strike is lost the trade unions' cause will receive a terrible setback, which it will not recover from foi many years. They have fears that the capitalistic cause will seize the opportunity of exploiting labour in its weakened condition. Government assurances that legitimate trade unions will not suffer would do much to allay the fears. If we found ourselves individually in the same position that this country is in, what would each and every one of us proceed to do? Work the very hardest we were able to do, cut out extravagances and save. Now, the people as a nation must do the same as individuals would do in the same crisis. What made France a great nation and enabled her to pay all her indemnity to Germany so rapidly after 1870? The whole nation worked and saved. In France during the earlier stages of the war it was found that the men from the Sunny South were not equal in energy and staying powers to the men of the North. To have to buck nature produces a hardy and virile Tace. Canadians occupying the northern half of this continent have a rigid climate to en-

dure which has undoubtedly produced a virile race which should be second to none in industrial activity.
We come now to another class of the community which has not received very much attention, and which is suffering perhaps more than any other class; I refer to the salaried men, the ""silent sufferers'* as they have been called. Although the figures show that the cost of living has doubled, the salaries of this class have probably ndt been raised in proportion to the increases granted to the working men. To solve the difficulty, we must first control the spread between .the manufacturer and the consumer. The manufacturer has been blamed almost altogether by the public for the high cost of living, but I think I am safe in saying that the middle man is more to blame than any other. I recall one instance where an article sold wholesale at S3 a box, at a profit of 30 cents, when retailed was sold for nearly three times that price.
Sedition must be stamped out. It is all very well to talk of free speech, but to talk of Bolshevism and riots and overthrowing the Government is a different thing, and I think the Sedition Act might well have been amended four years ago instead of now; but better late than never. Radical Socialist leaders must be interned or deported. As I have already said, the heart of labour is all right, but many of labour's leaders are all wrong. Free speech must be allowed where it deals with plain justice. Leaders who speak of Bolshevism or revolt must be taken in hand. In a full house at the Walker theatre at Winnipeg a few months ago, the meeting which was strongly in favour of Bolshevist rule in Russia, passed a resolution approving of the Soviet system in Russia.
Sympathetic strikes must be abandoned. The community have a great deal to say about that, and the community have shown where they stand in regard to the strike at Winnipeg. The outlook in the morning papers is good. Many of the unions are beginning to realize that they have troubles enough of their own without taking on others. The Toronto Street Railway workers have refused to go out on strike, and the same is true of many other unions.
The Government must deal with the situation with a firm hand The Criminal Code should be amended to prevent civic, provincial and federal employees joining in any sympathetic strike. These employees are employed for their service to the community and not for gain. The community
is alive to their interests in industry. They are out for justice. They appreciated their position last year when the civic strike was on at Winnipeg, and they have appreciated it more keenly this year. They are going to be a bigger factor than heretofore to reckon with, both from the standpoint of labour and capital. I hope that they will pursue not only in Winnipeg but in every other large centre an aggressive campaign of education for both capital and labour. They must be reckoned with in any sympathetic strike.
I speak as a neutral. I have not a dollar invested in any industrial enterprise in the country. I work among the poor of Winnipeg. I know their troubles and II have spoken as the truth came to me.
Our men have fought nobly and well, but some of them find it hard to settle down again. They have proved themselves heroes in fighting the battles of the Empire; they are proving themselves greater heroes in fighting the much harder battle of life. The war is a thing of the past, and henceforth they will be judged by the success with which they fight the battle of life. We must not forget, first, our service to our country, our service to our fellow man, and our service to the perpetuation of Canada.
IMr. E. LAPOINTE (Kamouraska):	Mr. Speaker, I think no one on this side of the Mouse feels it necessary to offer apology for any anxiety to discuss this subject to-day. Neither will I answer the rather unkindly remark of my hon. friend at the beginning of his speech with reference to the troubles in Quebec last year-troubles which the Right Hon. the Prime Minister described in England last summer as having been greatly exaggerated by the press both of Canada and of Britain. The good old much-abused, ill-understood, wholly Canadian province of Quebec seems to be remarkably at peace at the present time, and I think 1 might very well confine my remarks to a discussion of the trouble where the trouble exists.
This debate is certainly of the most extreme urgency. We have been criticised for not having already discussed in the House this alarming situation. I was personally of the opinion that the hands of the Government should not be hampered and that full liberty of action ought to be accorded them in order that they might try to effect a speedy settlement, and I also thought that it was better to afford some time to the Right Hon, the Prime Minister to do something with a view to remedying a condition that is largely the result of negligence, mal-",,,,

administration and blunders. But, Sir, the period of blunders does not seem to have ended with the return of the Prime Minister. Indeed, every day brings forth new and terrible mistakes. The troubles are spreading to places and centres which formerly were industrially at peace, and the Government appears to be lamentably impotent and inactive. Wt.- has the Government done so far? After waiting until it was too late, it sent two ministers to ""Winnipeg as mediators and for the purpose of reorganizing the mail service. Later on I shall express my opinion of this mission of our two ministers. The Government has also appointed a Parliamentary Commission to investigate the high cost of living. In this connection is it not appropriate to repeat those famous words of a British statesman, uttered two years ago: "" Too late ! Again it is too late."" Undoubtedly, the cost of living and the war profiteers have a great deal to do with the grave situation with which we are confronted. Consumers cannot readily recognize the fairness of a system or a policy which allows meat trusts, flour trusts, and otheT dealers in the necessaries of life to pile up their dividends and multiply their millions while the prices of bread, bacon, meat and other commodities are soaring into altitudes heretofore unknown. If my hon. friend from Victoria (Sir Sam Hughes) thinks, as he expressed himself in the House the other day, that the Government is owned by 'Sir Joseph Flavelle, is it any wonder that so many people in Canada regard the administration as being directed and controlled by the profiteers? The workingman is told that his wages have greatly increased. But, Sir, wages are purely nominal when their increase is only made to correspond with a larger advance in the prices of articles. It is immaterial whether a man earns fifty cents an hour or two dollars an hour; the significance of his wages depends altogether on what the fifty cents or the two dollars can purchase and thereby make for proper living in his home.
But, Mr. Speaker, whatever may be the finding of the Parliamentary Commission on the high cost of living, whatever light it may throw upon the subject, the important question is: What will be done in the meantime to end the strikes which paralyse the country? What remedy will he resorted to? We cannot afford to wait. As was said on a memorable occasion: We are not confronted with a theory; we are facing a most terrible condition, and it is useless to try to mystify the public by acting a Bolshe-
[Mr .E. Lapointe.]
vist melodrama to cover administrative and governmental negligence. We cannot allow a chaotic policy of laissez-faire while industrial unrest is growing steadily more acute; and the apparent willingness of Parliament to let matters drift from bad to worse will but breed a dangerous intolerance among the wage-earners. We must have industrial peace in this country. Too long have suspicion and distrust prevailed between capital and labour, those two .twin brothers of productive enterprise. Unless capital and labour solve their difficulties by working frankly and whole-heartedly in co-operation. *Canada cannot be equipped for the coming war of commerce, and she cannot be able to devote all her energies and all her work to the expansion and betterment of her trade and national life.
A union between employer and employed is necessary to the welfare of the individual, the family, and the country, and for Canada to-day this is a question of life and death. Formerly the labour man knew only his wants, his desires., and, at times, his sufferings. But he has come to know his power, and realizes that he is an indispensable factor in the production of wealth, and he accordingly claims the right to be treated frankly as a partner, with equal rights and *equal responsibilities. Unfortunately certain employers look upon their employees as cogwheels in the industrial machine, having a market value hut no recognized rights as human beings. It is fortunate that the big nations of the world agreed upon some fundamental principles as to the rights of labour and that such principles are to be embodied in the Peace Treaty. Let me read the first two principles. They are:-
First. The guiding principle above enunciated that labour should not be regarded merely as a commodity or article of commerce.
Second. The right of association for all lawful purposes by the employed as well as by the employers.
When the hon. the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowell) indicated to the *House those two clauses as being among-the principles to be included in the Peace Treaty, he said that they had been adopted on the motion of the Right Hon. the Prime Minister. I do not know whether he was right in that assertion, because I happened to read in a French newspaper that some other gentleman was the mover of the resolution, and I thought that perhaps it might have been a piece of little propaganda or impropaganda, and that my hon. friend might have received his information from his own information bureau. How-

ever, whether as mover or supporter of the labour resolutions, the hon. the Prime Minister gave his assent to them. This being so, I am at a loss to understand how the principle of collective bargaining can be resisted or objected to if the Government intends to live up to the agreement entered into at the Peace Conference.
The right of association to the employees is worthless and Valueless unless it is accompanied by, and means, ""the right to make association or organization effective. It is apparent that the individual labourer is at a great disadvantage when bargaining with the employer. The employer is often a big corporation, a combination of capital. The labourer is poor and to make his living must rely on working in the property of other people. Having no resources to fall back upon, he cannot wait until he can obtain the best bargain from the employer. It is a case of the necessities of the labourer pitted against the resources of the employer. It is only when the labourer bargains collectively that he has bargaining power approximating equality with that of capital. I do not think there is a better definition of collective bargaining than that which is found in the report of the Commission on Industrial Relations in the United States:
This term embodies and implies the right of employees to organize and to exercise those functions which are necessary to make organization effective, to make bargains collectively rather than individually and, most important of all, to have a definite, recognized voice, coequal with that of the employer, in determining the wages, hours and working conditions upon which their safety, health and life are dependent.
If collective bargaining is at all desirable, organized labour must be conceded the right to use the methods through which it can be secured or obtained by agreement. On Tuesday last the right hon. the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) answered a question asked by the hon. member for Centre Winnipeg (Mr. Andrews) as follows, Hansard page 2956:
Now one can easily see that what is called the right of collective bargaining, if interpreted in a certain way and carried to an extreme, length, might have an unfortunate effect so far as the public interest is concerned. More than that, as is suggested in this public statement, it might have the effect of placing labour men and labour unions themselves in such a situation that they could not make their oivn bargains except with the approval of some body that might be situated thousands of miles away. Before the phrase ""collective bargaining"" is insisted upon, we ought to have, and we must have, an exact definition as to precisely what is intended by it and as to precisely what the results might
191J
be if that principle, so defined, should be adopted. On that point the Government will probably have suggestions or recommendations in the report of the Industrial Commission, which we hope to receive not later than the fifteenth day of next month. My hon. friend who has asked this question will realize that it would be out of place and, indeed, invidious for the Government to attempt, by way of anticipation, to pronounce upon questions which are properly within the scope of the duty imposed upon that commission.
On the following day I inquired whether some part of (Collective bargaining was favoured by the Government. Still the Prime Minister answered that we would have to await the report of the Industrial Commission. May I say, in the first place, with all due respect to the Prime Minister, that I was astonished at this answer of his. Surely, if he favoured at the Paris Conference, the right of association, which includes the right of collective bargaining, he 4 p.m. knew what that right meant irrespective of any meaning that the Mathers Commission could give to it. There is another consideration. The right hon. gentleman based his comment on a certain statement of Senator Robertson published in the press and reading as follows :
The central strike committee interprets the right of collective bargaining to mean that the central body shall have the power to approve or reject any agreement that may 'be satisfactory to the employer or classes of employers and their employees, which, if granted1, would have the result of enabling any central committee entirely outside the industry or craft affected to dictate the acceptance or rejection of any agreement. Instead of giving to the workmen in any individual plant or industry the right of collective bargaining with their employers, the present plan deprives them of the right and places them entirely in the hands of a central body, which principle, the Citizens' Committee of Winnipeg, Provincial and Federal Government, agree cannot be accepted.
Sir, this statement of Senator Robertson has been challenged by the labour leaders of Winnipeg and it is only fair that I should read their version of the case. I take it from the Montreal Star:
We challenge absolutely this statement ot the Minister of Labour. It is entirely beside the facts of the case. The Postal Federation for instance have never submitted either schedules or agreements to the Trades and Labour Council, nor have the railroads, nor have the (building trades, nor has any organization at any time. The principle at stake at this time is that all workers should have the same rights of organization as have, say, the railroad workers. Senator Robertson must know this has been denied to the Metal Trades workers and because of this the strike was called.
This is the principle at issue in this strike and the interpretation given by Senator Robert-",,,,
proceedings1919_06_02.csv,535486,ca.proc.d.1919-06-02.6.1.4,1919-06-02,,,,stagedirection,,,,"son, if he was correctly quoted, is absolutely unjustified.
The workers are on strike for the principle of collective bargaining as understood by the Trades Union Movement. Nothing more and nothing less. For Senator Robertson to misconstrue the issue seems to us absolutely uncalled for. If he is in doubt he can get the fullest information by meeting the strike committee. They have approached him and shown that they are willing to inform him of the correct nature of the struggle.
There is a vast difference between the two interpretations, but this is the interpretation given by the labour men and must be considered as being their own interpretation. They know what they mean better than does Senator Robertson. Is it unfair for the working man to claim the right oi bargaining by industry instead of by craft or trade? The various trades of an industry are all links in the one chain. If one fails the others are worthless. For instance, in the metal industry, there are machinists, pattern makers, moulders and various other trades. Each one of them has its own special union. If an agreement is entered into by the employers with the machinists' union and with the patterns' union, but there is no agreement with the moulders, and there is trouble in the industry on account of that fact, the machinists and pattern makers will have to stop work as well as the moulders. It is easy to see that all the trades of the same industry have a similar and common interest in the proper carrying on of that industry. If you concede that, you must accept as fair and equitable the right of collective bargaining by all the trades in one industry.
The organization of capital has been unlimited. Powerful organizations have been formed combining many industrial establishments. It is only natural that there should be a similar evolution on the other side, on the part of labour, and that workmen in the various trades are uniting to protect their common interests.
The trade agreement, or collective bargaining, is one of the most generally accepted principles to-day in the world, and more especially in the United States and in Great Britain. I perhaps will surprise some hon. gentlemen-in view of the wild and stupid accusations of Bolshevism which are preferred against the labour movement at the present time-when I say that the advanced Socialist, such as the Independent Workers of the World, reject the collective bargaining and the trade agreement because they do not want to agree in any manner with what they call the capitalistic interest. Strange situation indeed to see the extreme Socialists, and some employers, f -Mr, E. Lapointe.!
reject the same means of settlement which evidently must be considered the fair and middle course.
I said that this principle is now accepted in United States and in Great Britain. Every hon. member can consult the Monthly Labour Review which is published by the Bureau of Labour Statistics in the United States Department of Labour. In its issue of March last you may see a list of the most important industries in the United States, which have accepted the principle of collective bargaining. I might quote only two, if you will allow me, Mr. Speaker, which are perhaps better known in this country-I mean the Standard Oil. Company and the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. I have here in the issue of the Labour Review of February, 1919, the agreement which was entered into by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation and the metal trades affiliated with the (American Federation of Labour. This agreement, and you will see that it is exactly what is asked for by the labour men of Winnipeg to-day, reads as follows:
Agreement made this 7th d'ay of January 1919, between the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation (Ltd), a Delaware Shipbuilding Corporation, (hereinafter called, the Company), and the Metal Trades Department of the American Federation of Labour, (hereinafter called the Department).
Witnesseth: That, whereas the department is an organization composed of national and international unions, (hereinafter called the unions), affiliated with the American Federation of Labour, many of the members of the said unions being in the employ of the company in its various plants ; and
Whereas the company recognizes the said unions collectively as a suitable agency to represent its employees in questions arising as to wages, hours of labour, and general working conditions and ;
Whereas the department is authorized, by the express consent of each union which is a member of the department to enter into an agreement with the company providing for the relations of the unions with the company-
And then the agreement follows. To show how many trades are interested in the same industry let me tell you that the organization of the steel industry by the American Federation of Labour included twenty-four different trades.
In Great Britain the principle is admitted and recognized by the employers and by the State. We have first the recommendation of the Whitley Commission which has been accepted by the British Government, and I will read clause 23 of the first report of that Commission which has been published by our own Department of Labour:
It may be desirable to state here our considered opinion that an essential condition of securing a permanent improvement in the

relations between employers and employed is that there should be adequate organization on the part of both employers and work people. The proposals outlined, for joint co-operation throughout the several industries depend for their ultimate success upon their toeing such organization on both sides, and such organization is necessary also to provide means whereby the arrangements and agreements made for the industry may be effectively carried out.
And in the appendix on page 30, it is said that the councils which are to be formed should be composed only of representatives of trade unions and employers' associations.
At the beginning of the present year, Great Britain was facing a critical industrial situation. The crisis came to a head when the Triple Alliance-the miners' federation, the railwaymen's union, and the transport workers - joined together and threatened a general strike if steps were not taken to meet the demands of organized labour. The Government of Great Britain answered this ultimatum by calling a national conference, composed of eight hundred members representing the employers and the workers interested equally to go into the whole industrial situation and to report upon it immediately. The conference held its first meeting on February 27, and appointed a joint committee which made a report which was unanimously approved by the eight hundred representatives of both the employers and the employees. They agreed on the following things:
(1) A National Industrial Council of 400, half capital and half labour, is to toe elected by the employers and the trade unions and to be recognized by the government as the "" official consultative authority on industrial relations."" (2) Not only are the unions to be free from molestation, jbuit it Is ruled that workmen should accept their jurisdiction. (3) Parliament is to enact a national minimum wage law, a 48-hour week and measures raising the legal age of child labour and extending the principles of short-time work .to meet the problems of unemployment. All of this programme is now before Mr. Lloyd George's Cabinet.
There was also the Sankey Report-the report of a commission which was instituted to prevent miners' strikes. The Sankey Report has been accepted by the British Government, and it not only grants the right to the miners to unite and bargain collectively but also recognizes their right to co-partnership and to share in the management of the mine.
Ail this shows that there is nothing very new or very revolutionary in the demands set forth by the Canadian labour men. It also shows conclusively that had our own Government acted as other governments have in the face of a situation infinitely
more serious than our industrial situation, difficulties and troubles might have been avoided. While the other governments were taking speedy and effective action the Canadian Government seemed unable to read the writing on the wall, and merely buried its head, ostrich-like, in the sand of its numberless and powerless Orders in Council. Various religious bodies in America and Great Britain have endorsed and recommended the adoption of the demand of the labourer, including the right of collective bargaining.
Among the number are the National Catholic War Council, and the Federal Council of Churches in the United States, and in England the archbishops' committee on Christianity and industrial problems.
May I read to the House the following extract from the New York Nation, which appeared in its issue of March 8th?
Archbishop Patrick J. Hayes, lately appointed to succeed Cardinal Farley as head of the Archdiocese of New York, is one of the four men who formulated the striking programme of social reconstruction that has recently been made public by the National Catholic War Council and,, as spiritual leader of 1,32(5,00*0 Catholics, he will play an important part in its further development. Without piety of mysticism, and1 with remarkable tough-mindedness, the War Council has recognized the industrial struggle as the most serious menace to the future peace of every nation. As immediate remedies, it advocates a national system of labor exchanges ; the retention of the National War Labor Board ; no lowering of the wages attained during the war., ""even when the cost of living recedes,"" for, says the pamphlet, ""after all, a living wage is not necessarily a full measure of justice"" ; the legal (minimum wage ; recognition of the right of labor to organize for collective bargaining; adequate housing; the establishment of co-operative stores; vocational training; abolition of child labor; heavy taxation of incomes, excess profits, and inheritances ; and prevention of monopolistic control of commodities. In its more fundamental suggestions, the programme approaches syndicalism, rather than socialism-the abolition of the wage system, though not the abolition of private ownership. ""Full possibilities of increased production will not be realized so long as the majority of the workers remain mere wage-earners. The majority must somehow become owners, or at least in part, of the instruments of production."" The capitalist, in the meantime, ""needs to learn the long forgotten
truth that wealth is stewardship	 that
the laborer is a human being, not merely an instrument of production ; and that the laborer's right to a decent livelihood is the first moral charge upon industry."" ""This,"" concludes this remarkable programme, ('is the human and Christian, in contrast to the purely commercial and pagan, ethics of industry.""
I hope I have convinced yon, Mr. Speaker, that, after all, there is nothing revolutionary or Bolshevistic in the demands of the workmen for collective bargaining.

I do not think that any advance will he made towards a settlement of our labour troubles by the slanderous attacks which are made by the Government press against the leaders of the working men. It is not true that the labour leaders at Winnipeg or at Toronto are foreigners on Bolshevists. In both places the committees are composed almost exclusively of British-born citizens. They belong to that sturdy class of immigrants which I have often heard described in this House as being the one class needed in this country. Why, Mr. Speaker, do you think if the Winnipeg strikers were foreigners' or Bolshevists that they would have succeeded in enlisting the sympathy of the returned soldiers? The employers- I beg pardon, the newspapers say-and the employers, too-that the returned soldiers are neutral. I read only yesterday that thousands of them after parading the streets of Winnipeg on Saturday, marched to the Parliament Buildings and intimated to Premier Norris that he should exercise his influence for the recognition of the principle of collective bargaining.

BUCHANAN (Lethbridge):,,J006 COMMONS,,,"1 would like to venture into this debate, Mr. Speaker, as an employer of labour as well as a member of this House who has attempted to keep in close touch with the aspirations of organized labour. We are discussing industrial unrest largely because of the developments in Winnipeg during the last few weeks; but, to my mind there has been unrest amongst organized labour for some months past. I have attempted to ascertain the reasons for that unrest, and I would enumerate them not in the order of their importance but as I have noted them down.
First of all, I think one of the paramount reasons for the present unrest among the working classes is the high cost of living; second, I would say that what we have been calling "" profiteering "" since the commencement of the war is another very important reason; third, the failure to fulfil some of the promises that were given to the labouring classes during the war, that out of this war would come a new world, and that they would live under new conditions; then there is a demand, of course -and I would classify this as a fourth reason-for better living conditions; there is a universal demand for the recognition of the eight-hour day; there is also a universal demand for the recognition of unions, and, again, there is the feeling that there should be more equitable sharing by the working classes in the profits of business.
Having enumerated the reasons for the unrest which exists, I will try to point out some of the remedies that we, as the Parliament of Canada, should provide. In regard to the high cost of living, I would say that it is our duty to adopt legislation to reduce that high cost. When the Budget comes down this week it seems to me that we should deal with the tariff in such a way that the cost of living will be reduced. It is argued that if you attempt to deal with the tariff you are going to injure the industries of this country. Are not those industries being injured now on account of the unrest that

is being caused by the high cost of living? If we can remove some of that unrest we are to that extent going to stabilize our industries. So I believe it is in the interest of the country as a whole that we should without any further delay remove the duties from foodstuffs and the real necessaries of life.
It has been argued that it is impossible to deal with the high cost of living; that it is too intricate a subject. I find that in New Zealand in the year 1915 the Government passed what is termed a ""Cost of Living Act,"" in which they attempted to reduce the cost of many of the necessaries of life. I saw an article the other day dealing with the price of footwear, and stating that in New Zealand the Government regulated the cost of the leather supplied to the manufacturers, and instructed them to manufacture only certain classes of boots in order that there should be a standardization of footwear, with a view to reducing the cost to the lowest possible point. We might very well keep in mind that it is possible to introduce legislation.-preceded, of course, by proper investigation.-that will attempt to relieve the unrest that is due to the high cost of living.
Now, as to profiteering. I feel that one of the greatest reasons for the present unrest, is the extravagant display of luxuries by people who have amassed wealth, because such display arouses dissatisfaction among those who have not the same means, and these feel that the men of wealth are getting too much profit out of the industries of this country compared with what the workers themselves are obtaining in the way of wages. That is one of the reasons for the demand by the working classes for co-operation or a share in the profits of industry. To remove the feeling against profiteering, I hope that very advanced steps will be taken this year in connection with our income taxation so that the real wealth of the country will be made to bear its share of the cost of government, and that wealthy people will be made to feel the burden as they have not felt it in the past.
The promises made during the war undoubtedly were featured by the assurance that following the war, there would be greater democracy throughout the world, and I think labour feels that that greater democracy should be realized without delay. If we are to have a new world we must have different living conditions. We must not have the housing conditions that have existed in the past; and we must attempt to look after the old and the infirm

by legislation rather than leaving them to be taken care of by fraternal societies and other organizations.	*
As to the eight-hour day, I may say that in the business I conduct we have had the eight-hour day for some years, and as a result of that experience I am an advocate of the adoption of the eight-hour day in every line of business in this country.

If that is any satisfaction to my hon. friend, that is where I stand. And I so stand as the friend of the working man. I can assure my hon. friend and the House generally that such a court will not be five years in operation before every one will say: It is a great pity that we did not have this institution long ago.
I submit that such a court is well worth establishing, and I contend that it would be one of the safest methods of dealing with disputes between capital and labour. I sub' mit that remedy. Sir, and I think that a Bill could be put through this House and through the Senate in less than a week, and that such a court in ten days could be sitting in Winnipeg to deal with the strike there. We would show our friends on both sides, capital and labour, that we are in earnest and are determined to give them an opportunity of dealing with their grievances in a proper way. The procedure can be by what is called a stated case, jr by tne hearing of evidence.
I may be absolutely wrong in this idea, but I am giving you, Sir, and the Government my honest opinion in the matter, an opinion which I have arrived at after several years' deliberation. For a long time I have held the belief that the only satisfactory way to settle a dispute is to settle it finally. A right of appeal might be provided for, but there must be established in this country an institution that will deal with these industrial disputes finally and settle them to the fair satisfaction of both parties. Hon. gentlemen may think that public opinion will not develop along this line. But when it is known that a court of the highest standing has deliberately heard a case and delivered judgment, that judgment appearing in the newspapers and the public be.ing seized of the fact, I am convinced that public opinion would develop to such an extent that no man would dare oppose the judgments of such a court. But if he were so foolish, then, as we have been told by the Acting Minister of Justice tonight, he would be running against the best thought of the country, as some men in the city of Winnipeg, he says, have been running against the strong current of public opinion in that city, with results familiar to us all.
Now, Sir, I have no other remedy to suggest. I submit, however, that the Government has been too slow entirely in dealing with these questions. The Winnipeg strike was in full blast, as I understand it, before the Minister of Labour and the Acting Minister of Justice left Ottawa. It has already been pointed out that they should have gone at a very much earlier stage, and should have stopped this trouble at its inception. ' ,
I may not have had very much to do with this question, but it should be pointed out to the Government that the tendency of their work for the last three or four years has been to create dissensions and divisions in this country for their own benefit, and they find now there are in Canada more dissensions and divisions, at all events, between capital and labour than they counted upon. They were willing to get power and to hold power by dividing this country, they cared not into what divisions of race and religion, one against the other. Now they find, when they are in power, they have lost that respect of the large body of the people which they would have held if they were in power by the lawful constitutional means which usually put governments into and out of power.
As I said at the begining, for my part, I am willing and anxious to respect the Government because they are the representatives of the people while they are here. At the same time, as we are all democrats and anxious to represent democracy in this House, it is only fair to point- out to the people that they are capable of making grave mistakes, and that they made a great mistake when they thought they were getting a democratic government in the one that rules to-day in Canada. I trust that although we have heard nothing yet of a practical nature from the Government, the Prime Minister himself or some other hon. gentleman will, before -this debate closes, tell us, and the people of Winnipeg, and the people of Canada generally, that the Government have some proposition

by which the conditions of this country will be bettered and troubles of this kind will not be likely to break out in future in the violent manner in which they have broken out in Winnipeg and other places lately. I trust that better conditions will prevail, .that good judgment will prevail, and that there will be no clash of any kind that will give this Canada of ours a bad name or any name of being unable or incapable of settling our disputes in a proper and constitutional way.

proceedings1919_06_02.csv,535524,ca.proc.d.1919-06-02.6.38,1919-06-02,unmatched,,,,J006 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend (Mr. McKenzie) has delivered a very interesting speech, part of it critical, part of it inspired certainly by an earnest desire to offer some constructive suggestion. I shall not dwell very long upon what might be called the controversial portion of his observations. When * he suggests that this Government is subject to the dictation of . any outside influence, or rather when he says that such is the belief, and that it may be true for all he. knows, I wish to assure hinj of what I am sure he must he convinced in his heart, namely, that this Government is subject to no influence and no dictation outside of this Parliament and never will be so long as I am at the head of it. He has referred at some length in somewhat discursive style to inquiries that were made two years ago or thereabouts. I venture to remind him that as the result of those inquiries, the most drastic measure of taxation was imposed by Order in Council on those engaged in the packing industry in Canada that has ever been known since this war began, or before it began, for that matter, taxation far in excess of anything suggested or carried out in the United States. It was so drastic that when the Order in Council was under consideration, the companies affected came before us and implored us not to go so far. Those big interests that are supposed to dominate this Government told us that their businesses would be absolutely ruined and destroyed if we persisted in going to the length that we purposed. Notwithstanding those protests from the big interests alluded to, the Government carried out precisely what it purposed, and that remains as the law of this country from that time up to the present.
My hon. friend was distressed because of his apparent belief that the present Administration had never, from first to last, taken a single step in the interest of labour since it came into power. Let me tell him that

it did what no previous Government in Canada had ever done or ever thought of doing, so far as I know; it selected a man who then was and still is a member of a labour organization in Canada, made him first -a member of the Government without portfolio and afterwards made him Minister of Labour, which position he holds until this day. I need not dwell further on the controversial portion of my hon. friend's remarks.
He attributes an extreme antiquity to what he is pleased to designate as Toryism. One thousand years ago, he said it began. I have been disposed to think, and I may tell my hon. friend in the greatest confidence, that there are many people who think that he is about as good a sample of fine old crusted Toryism as is to be found anywhere in Canada.
The hon. member for Kamouraska (Mr. E. Lapointe) made a number of interesting observations, very largely of a critical nature, but I did not observe anything very constructive in his remarks from beginning to end. He made one suggestion which seemed to be hardly sensible. He said that the Government had allowed matters to drift so long that it was entirely too late to do anything, but nevertheless it was absolutely necessary that something should be done at once. The hon. member for George Etienne Cartier (Mr. Jacobs) took upon himself to justify, so far as I could understand, the breaking of a solemn treaty by Germany in his effort to justify the breaking of contracts which had been alluded to by the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Meighen). These, however, are not of sufficient importance to justify me in wasting the time of the House upon them, because, after all, we come here for the purpose of taking counsel together and of endeavouring to find some suggestions, some light, some assistance in solving the difficult conditions that lie before this country at present.
Let me say to the hon. leader of the Opposition, lest I should forget it, that he is entirely mistaken in supposing that this Government has not called into conference both employers and employed in this country during the past two years. The Government has done that not once nor twice, but repeatedly, to my knowledge. I recollect that on the very last occasion that I sat in council before leaving Ottawa on the 8th November last, the Minister of Labour told me that for the first time in this country, employers and employed had come together

to take counsel of each other in reasonable conference, so that they might arrive at a better understanding, have better relations and prevent interruptions by strike. It is quite possible that our anticipations at that time have not been wholly justified by subsequent results; but I know that during my absence, my colleague, the Minister o* Labour, in conjunction with the other members of the Government has, from time to time, been in conference with employers and with employed. It was out of the conferences which he had with employers and employed that the idea was evolved which resulted in the appointment of the commission that is now investigating labour conditions in Canada.	.
So that, the reproach now put forward, that the Government has had no desire and made no attempt to assist in the solution of these problems, is wholly undeserved.
I shall now approach the conditions that prevail, not only in this country, but throughout the world, wiui a view to pointing out the tremendous problems that lie before all the nations, and the absolute importance that we in Canada, both employers and employed, should keep our heads and seek to work out our abundant opportunities for useful service to our country and to the world.	.
World conditions! Do hon.-gentlemen in this House remember that the greatest financial experts in the world said that the war which has lasted for five years could not possibly last more than one year, because the resources of the world would not allow the nations to continue longer? It has lasted for five years, and during that period about men have been withdrawn from productive activity. During that same period the waste which has gone on throughout the world in the endeavour of the nations on the one side and on the other to obtain a decisive victory is absolutely beyond our comprehension. We may state it in figures, but no man in the world can really comprehend or understand what it means. Would you like to have a reasonable estimate of what conditions were in Europe before this war began?-and during the past six months I have learned something of what they are to-day. A very important authority used this language in placing the situation of Europe before the British delegations at the Peace Conference:
By far the most important task before the Allied Governments is to get production and internal and external ""exchange economy"" working again on something like normal lines.
Before the war some 400,000,000 Europeans by working their hardest just managed to feed, clothe and house themselves and perhaps amass six months capital on which to live. That capital has vanished; the complicated machinery of internal and external production is more or less smashed; production has to a great extent ceased. The largely increasing population of Europe has only been maintained by the increasing development and inter-connection of world industry and finance. If this is not only checked, but for the time being destroyed, it^ is difficult to see how the population can be maintained at any rate during the very painful period of drastic readjustment. If free movement were possible and other countries could absorb it, there would inevitably he a vast emigration from Europe, until an equilibrium were established between the numbers of the population and the means of livelihood. As that is not possible this equilibrium must be reached in some other way.
Then he goes on to point out in a very graphic manner the almost insuperable difficulties that lie before the nations engaged in the task of reconstructing Europe to-day.
What does the present condition in Canada mean? We undoubtedly have very difficult problems before us but we have them in common with the rest of the world, and I fully believe that there is no country among all the nations where those problems are easier of solution than they are in Canada, if we are only true to our purpose, and have reasonable common understanding and common effort. This problem of industrial disturbance, inflation, and high prices, is not a new problem in the world's history. There has never been a war after which these phenomena did not make their appearance. It was the same a hundred years ago after the Napoleonic wars. After 1815 there were inflated prices and industrial disturbances. It was the same after the Crimean war of 1854. These are phenomena which makes their appearance inevitably after every considerable war, and after this the greatest of all wars in human history it was not only absolutely certain that these phenomena would make their appearance, but possible that they might continue for a longer period than ever before known.
It must be apparent to honourable gentlemen that in common with most thinking people in Canada, the Government foresaw there would be a very difficult period of reconstruction after the cessation of hostilities and the conclusion of peace. We sought a year, or eighteen months ago, to foresee conditions as best we could, to make such provision as is within the power of a government for conditions that were certain to arise. I hope honourable gentlemen will



realize, having regard to what I alluded to a moment ago-the withdrawal from productive activity of 50,000,000 men for nearly five years, the non-production and the terrible waste during that period, and the inflation consequent upon waste and non-production-that it is not possible for the Government of Canada or the Government of the United States or the Government of the United Kingdom or for the Legislatures of any of those countries or of all the countries of the world to fully remedy or remove conditions that have been thus created. But it was the duty of the Government to foresee as best it could, and to provide for as best it could, the conditions which were certain to ensue.
What have we done? The hour is too late for me to make more than a passing allusion to measures and policies which have been undertaken by the Government. As to the men who have fought the battle of freedom beyond the seas we believed that it would take a year or possibly eighteen months to effect their demobilization, but from the time that the armistice was signed until they will all be returned to Canada I believe that a period of not more than eight months will have elapsed. In order that they may have an opportunity of establishing themselves we have provided a war gratuity more generous, I believe, than has been provided by any other country in the world.
We have arranged conditions of land settlement which we have certainly endeavoured to make both reasonable and effective. We have provided as best we could for their settlement in various vocations and for their training for that purpose. We have established reasonable conditions to enable them to obtain that training. In addition we have made permanent provision for those who are afflicted with disease as a direct result of the war, and particularly for patients who have shown themselves to be infected by the scourge of tuberculosis. [DOT] These are only a few of the measures the Government has had in mind and carried out. We realized that as soon as the demand for munitions would cease there must be an earnest effort on the part of the Government to provide employment not only for the returning men, but also for those who could no longer find employment in the production of munitions. We went about that in two ways. In the first place we endeavoured to assure the working men of this country a share in the reconstruction of the devastated regions, and a share in the provision of necessary articles for

those countries in Europe which have been engaged in war during the past five years. Thus we have established not less than one hundred and twenty-five, or one hundred and thirty millions of dollars of credits in order that products which give employment to the working men in Canada, shall have their proper place in the markets of the world. More than that, we have embarked upon a policy of undertaking important public works for the purpose of affording employment, although otherwise we would have preferred to postpone the undertaking of these works until a season when the finances of the country were in better condition than at present. Now some hon. gentlemen on the other side of the House have spoken of blunders of the Government and some of them have referred to the alleged inaction of the Government.
Is there a single one of them who has found fault with the Government in respect of any of the matters just mentioned? And is there a single one of them who has even. suggested to the House the taking of any step which the Government has not taken? The conditions of unrest throughout this country are undoubtedly serious. I say, and say it with 'regret, that they are still more serious in the European countries which are now awaiting reconstruction. In Europe the problems that confront governments and parliaments in the various countries are, I repeat, infinitely more serious than any that confront us. Here is the situation in Europe as outlined by a very high authority:
The obstacles to the resumption of production are numerous. The main ones are the following::-
(1)	Destruction or disrepair of fixed plant and means of transportation, i.e., railways, canal, factories:
(2)	Back of raw materials, i.e., destruction hy war of all working capital:
(3)	Consequent loss of external purchasing power, i.e., lack of exports:
(4)	Depreciation of currency; often chaos of currency system:
(5)	Huge rise in prices, consequent loss of equilibrium between internal prices and world prices rendering export difficult:
(6)	Huge floating indebtedness to other countries:
(7)	Reduction of agricultural production owing to currency troubles and lack of purchasing power on the part of the industrial populations.
(S) Enormous taxation, acting as almost complete deterrent to new enterprise;
We have hardly any of these difficulties. Certainly they do not exist in an accentuated form in this country. Except for differences that ought to be composed between employer and employed, there is no

difficulty whatever which should prevent our country going on her way with renewed vigour and increased production, no difficulty in giving to every person capable of work an opportunity of employment which will assure him a reasonable living wage. The high cost of living is due absolutely to the world-wide conditions to which I have alluded, and over which no government and no combination of governments can exercise effective control. It is due to the enormous number of men withdrawn from productive activity, to the incredible economic waste of the past five years and to nonproduction at the present time. Such nonproduction is occasioned by the causes I have just enumerated so far as Europe is concerned. The! high cost of commodities is due also to that worldwide inflation from which we cannot wholly escape. We have a duty in this Parliament,
I have no doubt, to prevent as far as we possibly can undue combination and extortion, and it has been the policy and the effort of the Government during the past two years to carry out that policy. I think we have carried it out in reasonable measure. The tariff is alluded to and reductions in the tariff are advocated. They may be necessary or desirable. But, Mr. Speaker, I invite your consideration to this question. Having regard to conditions as they are in the world to-day-because the cost of living is much higher in the European countries that I have visited than it is in Canada; having regard to conditions in the United States, where the cost of living is I believe as high as it is in Canada, is there any one of us who can say that if the tariff were not modified or lowered hut absolutely wiped out root and branch to-morrow, the cost of living would be appreciably lower in this country? If we are to benefit in that way we must first find a country where the cost of living is lower than it is here. Let us consider -whether the lowering or the abolition of the tariff in the United States, or France, or Canada, or any other country, could overcome the world-wide conditions to which I have directed your attention? Some corporations and companies have made great profits. There is no doubt about that, and we have endeavoured to remedy that condition by the excess profits tax. But I want you to bear in mind that Canada is not the only country that has suffered in that way. In Italy, France, Belgium, and Great Britain itself, the cry is against the enormous profits made by some people in connection with the production of munitions, and otherwise. In every country the chief remedy sought, 184$
so far as I am aware, is to bring a large proportion of such profits into the public treasury for the benefit of the whole people.
Now, coming to the immediate question of the labour disturbances which unfortunately prevail in different parts of Canada let me say, so far as the eight-hour day is concerned, that we are committed to the proposals which are embodied in the Treaty of Peace, and the Federal Government proposes to carry them out to the extent of its jurisdiction and is impressed with the duty of doing so. To quote from the terms of the treaty:
First. The guiding principle above enunciated that labour should not be regarded merely as a commodity or article of commerce.
That stands as the first principle in the labour creed adopted by the nations which sat around the Peace table.
Second. The right of association for all lawful purposes by the employed as well as by the employers.
We are committed to those proposals, and it is the intention, so far as the influence of the Federal Government is concerned, to carry them out. And although my hon. friend from the Cartier division of Montreal (Mr. Jacobs) seemed to consider it entirely . a matter of no consequence as to whether or not we have constitutional power, surely the House will realize that we cannot invade the sphere of provincial jurisdiction merely because labour troubles at the present time are serious.
I took occasion to inform myself as to the respective powers of this Parliament and the provincial legislatures on this question and I have been advised by the law officers of the Crown that these are matters within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures and not within the jurisdiction of the federal Parliament. I observe that in the session of ,1910-11 the then Minister of Labour, Hon. Mackenzie King, speaking on a Bill introduced by Mr. Verville referred to the question of jurisdiction in these, words:
Every hon, member of this House knows that no Bill oan be passed by the Parliament of Canada which will give to the working classes generally an eight hour day. They know that that is the business of the provinces primarily, that it is the duty of the provincial legislatures to fix the hours of labour governing any particular industries.
If hon. gentlemen who are interested in this question will turn to the ""Labour Gazette"" of May 19, page 598, they will find that every province of Canada, except Prince Edward Island, has repeatedly legislated on the conditions and hours of labour and that the jurisdiction of the provincial

legislatures to deal with the question is sustained not only by the opinion of the law officers of the Crown, by the opinion of the Minister of Labour in the late Government, but also by the universal practice every since Confederation under which the provincial legislatures have dealt with this subject.
As to collective bargaining, I put forward the same view, that conditions of labour and matters of that nature all come within the purview of the provincial legislatures. But in so far as our influence and example are concerned, we have encouraged collective bargaining in the sense in which we understand it. The Railway War Board, which was established by this Government about a year, or a year and a half ago is one of the most useful examples of collective bargaining in its best sense that I know of. We meet our own employees at conferences and we have repeatedly brought about conferences between the employers and their men. We have taken every possible step towards a solution of these difficulties by mediation and conciliation and we arp doing our best, in composing these differences.
The leader of the Opposition has made a very important suggestion as to the enactment of a statute by this Parliament which will virtually abolish strikes and compel employers and employed to submit their differences to a fixed Tribunal. I have discussed the question of the right of the men to strike on many occasions and I would suggest to my hon. friend that before we undertake so drastic a step as to take away from the labour men of Canada a right which they prize as tihe Magna Charta of their liberties, we should require to have a very careful conference with them unless we were prepared to make matters very much worse than they are at present. The large majority of the labouring men in Canada are, in my judg-12m. ment, disposed to look upon these questions in a reasonable way.
It would be one of the greatest mistakes that this Parliament could make to drive into what one might call the extreme wing of the labour party in Canada men who have as a whole been fair and reasonable in their attitude towards this question. At the same time I am disposed to say to-night what I have said many times to labour men, that surely, by a fair and reasonable spirit on one side and on the other, wo can eventually, not by means of drastic legislation but by a better comprehension of each other's attitude, find some means more reasonable and more effective than

the strike for composing differences between employers and employed. I most sincerely hope and, more than that, I believe, that the labouring men of Canada will see their way to adopt that principle in the early future.
I put' the case before them, I think it was last summer, in the city of Toronto. We were discussing the question of the League of Nations and the abolition of war by means of conference discussion and publicity,-, with force perhaps in the background but only in the background. Take twenty-five or thirty nations speaking different languages with absolutely different ideals and at different stages of development and having a hard task in comprehending or realizing each other's outlook; if you expect these nations to unite for mutual discussion in the council of the League of Nations and thus compose their differences and if you base some reasonable hope upon the outcome of that proposal, surely the people of this country, living under the same laws and having very much the same ideals and the same point of view should be able to compose their differences at between employers and employed without resorting to the strike which has been described as little short of civil war. Indeed, a general strike carried out, as some people would desire to have it carried out, is little short of civil war.
I do hope, indeed, that the ideal which the leader of the Opposition has put before us to-night may be realized. I am not prepared to say it can be accomplished by the drastic methods which he has suggested. I rather think it must ""be accomplished by the better education of employers and employed, and by a realization of the new ideals which are an outcome of this war. In this connection I must express the hope-the very earnest hope-that some of the employers will give better indication of their comprehension of the new conditions and the new ideals arising out of war conditions. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, let us have good confidence in the sound, practical common sense of the people, of the workingmen of Canada, to find a solution for our difficulties in the not distant future. And let there be not the slightest doubt that in so far as the Federal Government and Parliament are concerned, and in so far as they have the right to speak or to legislate, their aid and co-operation will not be wanting to bring about a solution of these difficulties.

proceedings1919_06_02.csv,535525,ca.proc.d.1919-06-02.6.39,1919-06-02,69b07db5-d50e-4347-b919-ab2ed02f2a41,ca.m.5555,Mr. G. W. ALLAN (South Winnipeg):,,J006 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, in the debate precipitated this afternoon, by the hon. member for North Winnipeg (Mr. Blake), the discussion has taken a very wide range.
During the course of the afternoon the member for Centre Winnipeg (Mr. Andrews) gave to the House his views as regards not only the metal workers' strike, but the sympathetic strike, and although the hour is late I feel I must crave the indulgence of the House. I think it would not be inopportune if, at this stage, before the debate is closed, I should give the point of view as to these happenings, first of all of the employers, or the so-called ironmasters, and secondly of that large portion of the population of the city of Winnipeg that were-not directly at any rate, and to a very slight extent indirectly-in any way interested in the matter in dispute in the so-called metal workers' strike.
I was in Winnipeg five days, returning last Thursday, so that I can speak with some confidence, having been on the spot for that period of time, as regards what the conditions produced by the metal workers.' strike, and by the subsequent sympathetic strike, in that city actually were. I should like, first of all, to read a letter which was handed to me on my arrival by the assistant general manager of the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works, Limited. I desire to state to the House that I happened to have had an early and a continuous connection with that company from the time it employed only a few men until now it has grown to be a company of some considerable proportions, employing a large number of men in Winnipeg -in fact, between it and its subsidiaries, giving employment to between six and seven hundred men. I am satisfied from the inquiries I made, and from meeting with pretty well every phase of the question, that this letter will give the very closest approximation of the actual happening with the three iron companies, and that absolutely, completely, and without any possibility of contradiction or mistake, it gives the actualities of the happenings with this particular metal company. I may say that the letter does not happen to be dated, but was handed to me on the morning of the day following my arrival in Winnipeg. The letter is as follows:
The present situation developed, so far as our company is concerned, in the latter part of April, through the presentation of a schedule by the Metal Trades Council requiring the signing of an agreement, with that body, whereby many drastic changes would be made in our operations principally:
(a)	substitution of the 8-hour day for 10 hours.
(b)	An increase in.wages of from 30 to 60 per cent.
(c)	The submission of our Shop Rules to regulation by the Metal Trades Council.
(d)	The payment of a uniform wage irrespective of ability.
(e)	The arbitrary classification of men on a Railway Shop basis.
The officials of the company posted a notice intimating that they would be glad toi discuss with the Shop Committee this, or any. other matter considered to be requiring adjustment.
A meeting was held and the company after some discussion offered, as had been done some weeks previously to grant a nine-hour day with ten hours pay and a minimum wage of $4 per day, or practically 45 cents per hour for common labour. We pointed out that as our business was taken in competition with Eastern Canada and the United States our hours and working conditions must be governed by the conditions prevailing there, we therefore made the proposition that should it be established that the eight-hour day was in effect in competitive plants in the East, that it should be immediately put into force here; the same pay as for ten hours being given, that is, the hourly rate would be increased 2'5 per cent. It was thought and stated that this investigation which would be carried on by employees and employers independently would take a month or six weeks. It was also pointed out that for the present the company was prepared to deal with its own men only. The Shop Committee agreed to consider the proposal, and the following day submitted a schedule from which the name of the Metal Trades Council had been eliminated. The company's officials repeated the offer concerning the eight hour day, and stated that rates could be discussed, also other minor conditions.
On May	the larger number of our
workmen were called out, many of them stating that they left against their will, and since that date we have not been operating except in a limited way.
On May 8th, with Messrs. Barrett and Warren, representing the Vulcan Iron Works and the Dominion Bridge Company, I was called into conference with the Mayor and we suggested to him that we were willing to submit all differences to arbitration. He stated that he would put the suggestion before the labour people. This resulted in a meeting being held in the Builders' Exchange May 9th, at which Premier Norris, Mayor Gray, Mr. Winning and other representatives of the Trades and Labour Council were present, together with Mr. Hazel-ton, president of the Builders' Exchange, and we three representatives1 of the Iron Working Shops. At this meeting the question of arbitration wTas barely mentioned and little was accomplished. The following day a meeting was held, Premier Norris presiding, in the Builders' Exchange, at which there were present five representatives of the Metal Trades Council, and the three representatives of the Iron Shops. The following suggestions were offered by the employers:
First. The establishment of a 4 5-hour week on 55-hour pay.
Second. The deferment of the matter of recognition of the union until such time as an Employers' Association

aa outlined before the Mathers Commission had been formed, and the necessary machinery established to make such agreements effective. '
Third. The submission to a board of arbitration to be appointed wholly by the Premier of all points at issue.
The first suggestion was not unfavourably received, the second not discussed but the Labour representatives stated they would submit the third to their meeting the following morning. Premier Norris then proposed the Board as follows, and gave the names to the meeting:
T. J. Murray, Solicitor for the Trades and Labour Council.
R. B. Russell, Secretary of the Machinists' Union.
R. P. McWilliams, Solicitor.
H.	B. Lyall, Manufacturer.
The following morning the Premier named Mr. R. D. Waugh, Chairman, and advised those who had been present at the meeting accordingly. Late that day, on making inquiry, he was informed by Secretary Robinson of the Trades and Labour Council, that it was not an acceptable solution. In the meantime before the hour set by the committee who represented the Labour organization before Premier Norris, for the consideration of his proposal, the notices calling a general strike were being delivered. Since the general strike has been oalled the Iron Shops, at the request of the Citizens' Committee have agreed to enter into no negotiations or make no settlement until the sympathetic strike has been abandoned, and conditions have become normal again in Winnipeg.
The cause of the strike is the alleged refusal of the Iron Companies to recognize ""Collective bargaining,"" which the strikers interpret to mean the signing of agreements with the Metal Trades Council, a local federation of Metal Tradesmen of different crafts. Incidentally it may toe pointed out that the Metal Trades Council is not generally recognized by the railways who have agreements with different orafts only. The term ""Collective bargaining"" is susceptible apparently of different interpretations. In the report of the Mathers Commission of 1918 signed by ex-President Tipping [DOT]of the Trades and Labour Council, the system then in vogue with at least two of the companies and their employees, whereby they met committees of their own men, and arranged matters pertaining to the individual shops is referred to as ""Collective bargaining."" This [DOT]system of arranging the settlement of all differences and co-operating with employees by committees in regular conferences with them is as effective a method of ""bargaining collectively"" as can he conceived. True it does not recognize the Business Agent of the Union as it is assumed that he not having knowledge of the conditions in our shops, andi not toeing on our pay-roll should not exercise any authority in our plant; nor does it contemplate the signing of agreements with any but our own men.
On the other hand under the system no distinction is made between men belonging to the union, and those who do not, and our Shop Rules distinctly provide that we recognize the right of men to organize in any way and to be members of unions. For some months past we have had weekly meetings with Shop Committees at which all conditions were fully and freely discussed with very gratifying results.

Our reasons for objecting to becoming parties to an agreement with the Metal Trades Council at Winnipeg are briefly these:
First. Fully 80 per cent of our business is secured in competition with shops In Eastern Canada, and the United States, and our very existence depends upon conditions being no more onerous in our shops than in competitive plants. No shops in Canada or in the United States, to our knowledge, with whom we compete, operate under restrictive union conditions. We are a relatively small factory in the manufacturing field and cannot take the initiative in inaugurating new conditions.
Second. Winnipeg being a railway centre, probably eighty-five per cent of the metal workers of the city are employed in railway shops. The proposal is that we should sign an agreement putting into force railway sho-p conditions in our plant. These conditions are notoriously unadaptable to competitive business through restrictions on output, and imposition of rules respecting use of machines, classes of work which certain men shall do, etc. The preponderance of railway employees in such unions would inevitably lead to the domination of our shops by men who have no understanding of the necessities of competitive business.
Third. Any agreement made with the Metal Trades' Council of Winnipeg as at present constituted would, in our opinion, be participation in a plan to place industry in Canada under the control of interests which do not truly represent labour, but which have other aims in view than the betterment of social conditions in this country.
Fourth. Until the principle of the sympa-thetie strike is discarded the signing of an ""agreement which may be broken the next day on account of a disagreement in some other plant is useless, and would render contract business impossible.
I beg, however, to call your attention to the proposed plan placed before the Mather Commission on Industrial Relations, when it was sitting in Winnipeg this month, by Winnipeg Manufacturers. This plan is an adaptation of the Whitley, Rockfe'.ler, and other systems now in successful operation, and provides for the making of agreements between responsible organizations of Employers and Employees with Councils, Local, Provincial, and	Federal,
through which adjustment of any difficulties can be had. To this plan we can give our hearty assent believing it will solve our particular trouble, and it is the earnest hope of Metal Trades Manufacturers that it may toe adopted in some form or another.
Yours very truly,
H B. B. Lyall.
I now wish to say a few words as to what results the sympathetic strike produced upon that very large	portion
of the population of Winnipeg that had no special interest in and was in no way connected with the metal workers or the metal employers. The sympathetic strike took the people by surprise as it came so quickly, very much after the fashion of the war and due to the difficulty we experienced in believing that it

would be suddenly precipitated upon us in so comprehensive a manner. I for one, having lived in Winnipeg practically all my life-forty years this month-would not have believed it if any one had put it up to me six weeks ago-although I had followed fairly closely the events in that city and mixed freely with all classes of our people-that for a brief period, the Government of the city could have been taken over by the so called "" Big Five "" or council of five. But the fact was that practically out of the blue the city of Winnipeg was closed up about as tight as a box. The post office facilities came abruptly to an end and also the telegraphic facilities. The going out on sympathetic strike of the employees of the Federal Government, the Provincial Government, and the Civic Government, and the suspension of many services and many businesses produced the most drastic discomfort, at any rate for a short period, and this discomfort still subsists to a very considerable extent. The police voted to go out on sympathetic strike, but remained at their duty at the request of the Strike Committee. What degree of reliance could be placed upon them, I think, can very well be appraised under such conditions. The firemen went out. Then the water supply, the removal of garbage-all those services which are necessary for the comfort of the city with a population of approximately 200,000 people, were impaired or were suddenly brought to an end. The water supply as controlled, was absolutely inadequate for the purposes of protection against fire; and for a time the city was practically helpless in this particular. The pressure was such that no water could go beyond the ground floor of any building. To a very large extent, in common with all western cities, Winnipeg has a markedly large number of apartment houses, and it can be easily imagined, without my labouring the subject, what that meant so far as discomfort is concerned, and also what the cutting off of bread and milk meant, particularly to the patients in the hospitals and to babies. Those conditions in which seemingly for a time there was partially usurped the Federal, the Provincial and the Civic authority passed away very soon, and there is no doubt what precipitated prompt organization on the part of all citizens who were not participating in [DOT] the strike was produced by the practical tie up of the city, and the attempt to usurp governmental control. What was produced there was a banding together with extraordinary solidarity, which I have absolute confidence will remain
to the end, of all those who felt that their property, the lives of their families and the ordinary comforts and protections to which they were entitled demanded their attention and care. They felt that they should, to the full extent of their ability do what the Federal authorities required of them. To voluntarily assist wherever the public service was affected, which meant that when the 400-odd employees of the post office went out, the Citizens' Committee were prepared promptly to give whatever number of voluntary assistants could be taken charge of by some fourteen men who remained in the service of the post office. The statement was made: We will replace either the number that have gone out of the service of the post office on strike, or we will give you a larger number, or we will give you any number that you can handle and will increase that from time to time promptly on your demand. 1 may say that in the choice of those whom they turned over as volunteers to this Government, they gave the men most capable of according effective service. Among others sorting letters in the Winnipeg Post Office were Mr. C. P. Wilson, K.C., leader of the Manitoba Bar, and Mr. P. A. Macdonald, Utilities Commissioner of the Province of Manitoba. I saw man after man the heads of large concerns and others holding important positions in the city so occupied during the first period in which voluntary relief was accorded to the postal service.
To the province similarly the Citizens' Committee accorded volunteer assistance through their daughters and wives to the telephone exchanges to take the place of sympathetically striking telephone operators. Their offer was accepted by the Provincial Government and was of great advantage during the period that I was in Winnipeg. Of fourteen firehalls in Winnipeg, thirteen were fully manned by volunteers offered promptly by the Citizens' Committee to the civil authorities. There was not, on the part of the people in the district surrounding one firehall in Weston, which happens to be a suburb near the Canadian Pacific shops, seemingly a desire to have volunteer assistance, and that is the only firehall out of fourteen that I was informed was not fully manned. During my visit a fire thai had often been dreaded in Winnipeg, and which might have had the most serious results, started next to the Hudson Bay departmental store on Main street, skipped, owing to the wind being in the

PELLETIER (Matane):,,J006 COMMONS,,,"I am pleased that the Government has finally allowed the question of the present industrial unrest to come before the House for a fair discussion and a frank expression of opinion from hon. gentlemen. It is one of the most important questions with which we have to deal.
With the suspension of hostilities in Europe, with the dawn of peace bringing contentment and solace to all hearts, how is it that the country to-day is actually in a worse situation than when we were at war? How is it that the merry ringing of bells announcing the coming of peace in Europe announces at the same time a state of industrial war in Canada?
What is the cause of this industrial unrest and of the universal unsatisfactory feeling that prevails throughout the country? It is not necessary to go through a long and dreary inquiry to ascertain the cause of this trouble. It is apparent and every one realizes it at sight. It is the unbearably high cost of >
living and the
necessity for the working classes to have better conditions, better wages, lower prices for foodstuffs, clothing, and all the necessaries of life. But it is not sufficient to find out the cause of a social evil to remedy the situation. One must see who is responsible for such conditions. Then it will be possible, if there is goodwill on the part of those responsible, to find a solution of the serious problems which must be settled if Canada is to live. The fundamental cause of all the trouble we are actually going through lies in the lack of sincerity, wisdom, foresight and Canadian patriotism on the part of the present Government. The hon. gentleman to your right, Mr. Speaker, may think that such a statement is a slander against the present Government, and it would be such if I did not have absolute proofs to substantiate the indictment. The time has come when we must look the situation boldly in the face, examine our national conscience, and set aside the rubbish of electoral parley to consider if the governing influence of Canada has really worked for the general good, or simply for the benefit of the privileged class. The time has come to put a soft pedal on the patriotic camouflage which has been the only means of putting through this House and the country all sorts of measures and thousands of Orders in Council; and to scrutinize the real motives which prompted the Government to place Canada on the verge of bankruptcy and on the threshold of revolution. Not only does serious industrial unrest manifest itself, but there are innumerable strikes in large cities And there is also a supreme contempt of the Government of the land, and an evident relish for revolutionary ideas and principles, so much so that in the city of Winnipeg there was a tentative Soviet against which the Government did not dare to take stringent measures. Had it been an ordinary industrial crisis, had the Government not been responsible for the situation, and had the people at large had the least confidence in the ministers of the Crown, the settlement would have been an easy matter because the Government would have been the high court to which the grievances would have been brought. But such is not the case. The labouring class is dissatisfied, and does not care to have the Government's assistance, believing the Government to be a party committed to the opposing forces. I do not need further proofs than the fact of the reception given in Winnipeg to the ministers just returned from the West, and the result of their peace-imak/inig mission. Let us consider
.""018

for a moment how we have been brought to the unenviable position in which Canada finds itself to-day.
At the outbreak of the war, without any consultation with Parliament., my right hon. friend the Prime Minister pledged the country to England for 500,000 men. This offer was accepted, and to compel the people to accept it as granted, numbers of orators, journalists and canvassers sounded from one end of Canada to the other the note of devotion to the Motherland, to the cause of liberty and civilization, and devotion to the cause of the small countries. They declaimed upon the phantom of German tyranny as if Canada had been threatened with immediate invasion. This was done with the deliberate object in view to cover the extremely dangerous consequences, for a country as small and as poor as Canada, of assuming responsibilities beyond our means. During the long years of struggle, whilst the final victory was uncertain, and as long as the united efforts of the allied nations were necessary to keep up the morale of our soldiers, nothing was said. But now that the war is over and the Allies have been victorious, it can be said to the Government that its action was nothing short of national suicide, and we are beginning to realize the fact. For the four years of the war, we drained the country of our best young men, we crippled our industries by the multiplication of shell factories, we allowed speculators to increase the price of every necessity of life to such an extent that it became necessary to maintain the output of munitions, to increase the salaries of munition workers tenfold, while the other classes of working men were in a sorry plight. Today they ask that these conditions be made bearable, and they are not to blame. The responsibility for these conditions lies at the door of those who have allowed them to be created. But the Government has not only been extravagant in its promises to Great Britain; it has been totally inefficient in preparing for the necessary transition from war to peace. Notwithstanding the advices given privately and publicly, the Government did not see fit even to try to do anything in that direction, all its efforts having been bent upon the prosecution of military service defaulters and the contriving of means whereby to remain in power. Instead of taking measures to fix prices, to protect the labouring men against the greed and heartlessness of speculators, the Government has simply marked time w'aiting for r.M. Pelletier.]
events to pass on at will, seeming unfit to foresee the crisis we are facing to-day. If this is not correct, let the hon. gentlemen to your right, Mr. Speaker, point out one single measure prompted by wisdom and a desire to assist the poor. Let them show in what direction the country was prepared to switch its energies and activities from war-time industry to peace. What did the Government do whqn inquiries disclosed the fact that products, foodstuffs of all kinds, were rotting in warehouses and thrown away in order to maintain famine prices? What is the Government doing today when prices are even higher than they ever were before? What reasons are given for such conditions? Is it admissible that a Government, appreciating the importance of its duty, would allow food to be exported to such an extent thait its own people would suffer and be on the verge of starvation? Is there a country in the world that would bear with such a Government? Is there a country under the sun afflicted with such a ruling power? What is the result of such apathy, such inefficiency on the part of the Government? As long as the war lasted, as long as contracts and profitable orders were distributed, and there were men to be conscripted, this Government showed more autocracy than did the late Tzar. The whole Administration was run by Orders in Council adopted and enforced even when Parliament was sitting.
Now that the war is over, and since conscription has ceased, now that no more munition contracts can be given to heartless profiteers, the only activity displayed by the Government is as T have said before utter severity in the prosecution of defaulters who have suffered heavy fines and imprisonment.
Such a condition of affairs does not conduce to confidence in the Government, on the part of the working class, and a striking proof of this was given by the manner in which the ministers of the Crown were received by the union men in the West. We also have other striking examples of the energetic attitude of the Government in time of crisis, in the manner in which the strike activities were managed. We were sitting here discussing the abolition of titles when the ci >
of Winnipeg was in the pangs of Bolshevism. We are here discussing minor questions when the whole country is suffering, when the entire industrial structure is shaking-we are discussing, while the soul of the Canadian people want action and not words.
The Government has suffered from want of discretion in determining Canada's share

in the war; it has suffered from lack of sincerity in allowing prices of necessities of life to soar as they did; it has suffered from lack of foresight in not preparing for the after-war period.
It has suffered from lack of Canadian patriotism in sacrificing the future of the country; it has suffered from lack of wisdom in passing laws that Spread discontent and distrust in all ranks oi society; it has suffered from lack of ability as shown by the fact that it remained idle when it was time to act.
We are passing through a very critical period and no one knows what the results may be. Whatever the endeavours of this Government may be now I feel that it can accomplish very little, having lost the confidence and support of the people. The only wise and practical thing for the Government to do in the interest of the people, in my opinion, is to dissolve Parliament and allow the (people to elect honestly representatives who have at heart the welfare of the country.

It does seem to me, Mr. Speaker, if ever there was a time that we should get together and all take hold of one rope and pull in harmony, it is now. We talk about working six hours a day. In my opinion the time has come when we should work eighteen hours a day, and I think the fellows would do it too as long as they did not fear they would work that length of time to enable one or two men .to make millions out of it. They will not do that but they are ready to work and work well, when they deem the cause is a legitimate one. As an old farmer I cannot help but realize that it does not take any more bushels of barley to feed a hog to-day than it did five years ago. Yet the hog is worth five times as much to-day, it is a good time to sell hogs when the same amounted grain would yield five times the value, ft is about time that we got off our coats and worked together. I would like to see some very strong action taken with regard to the present situation. I do not like compulsion nor conscription; but I cannot help thinking that we ought to be able to establish courts of arbitration in this country that will give- a just award on a dispute that is referred to them. If that is done I think there would be enough public opinion behind the award to enforce it, and in	that
case our	troubles would be	over.
It is far better than letting this strike work itself out to the- bitter end, which means another fight. There are times when on principle I have as little theoretical regard for conscription as my hon. friend from Dorchester (Mr. Cannon). I do not believe in conscription, I never did; but, unlike my hon. friend, there are times when I think
it is justifiable. During a prairie fire if you come across a deaf man you do not stop to argue with him, but you grab him and take him along, and when he finds you did it to save his life, he is very glad that you did not stand upon ceremony. Conscription, I think, is sometimes justifiable, and in my closing words I strongly recommend that in this instance the Government adopt it forthwith.

Mr. BUOHANAbl:	I would like very
much to be able to continue the discussion with the hon. member for North Oxford, but it is impossible under the circumstances. As to the eight-hour day, I would like to quote the views expressed by Lord Leverhulme, a member of the British House of Lords, and one of the best known business men in Great Britain. He is not only advocating a reduction in the hours of labour to eight, but he is bringing the period down to six hours. I am not going to argue in favour of the six-hour day, but I would point this out, that in a book written by him he made the statement, that in the munitions industry in Great Britain at the commencement of the war, working hours at first were about twelve hours a day, and gradually they were reduced to eight and a half hours, and that this reduction of hours resulted in a greater production of munitions per day and perAveek. If that was the case, there cannot be very much objection to the adoption of the eight-hour day throughout this country. Lord Leverhulme in this volume from which I am quoting made this statement:
Government reports repeat over and over again, from definite experiments, that in a reasonable number of hours the human being turns out its maximum output. Fatigue the human being one day, let the man or woman come fatigued to work the following day, and so on, and after two or three days the output goes down, down, down, and is continually falling.

I think that is the case. I am satisfied that in my own business the production is just as good as when we had a nine-hour day.
In 1886 the output of a certain class of worker in the United Kingdom was 312 units;-
I am quoting these figures to exemplify an argument used by Lord Leverhulme to show that in the United States where they were more advanced in their legislation as regards working hours than they were in Great Britain, the production was greater.
In 1886 the output of a certain class of worker in the United Kingdom was 312 units. In 1906 it had dropped to 275 ; in 1912, the last recorded year before the war, it had fallen to 244-a drop of 68 units in twenty-six years. In the United States the output per worker in 1886 was 400 units; in 1906 it was 596 ; in 191 it was 600-a rise of 200 units. The output also rose during the same period in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, so that Lord Leverhulme is forced, to the conclusion that, of the English-speaking races all over the world.
And Lord Leverhulme reaches the conclusion that by the reduction of hours of labour, production in Great Britain will not be interfered with, but rather it will be helped.
Since industrial troubles have arisen in this country, many views have been advanced as to proper co-operation between labour and capital. Only yesterday, I read in a Canadian paper an article explaining the system adopted by the Sears-Roebuck Company of Chicago. I am going to place the two systems that I have before me on record because I think they are of considerable value in this discussion:
The Sears-Roebuck Company, a great mailorder house which employs about 20,000 men and women, have had in operation for about three years a plan of profit sharing.
In 18 mo.nths of its operation, the plan discovered the following facts:
Ninety-one per cent of the eligible employees contributed to the fund.
The employees in 18 months paid into the savings fund about $439,500. The company contributed in the same period $1,318,712, that being 5 per cent of its net profits without deduction of dividends to stockholders.
Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears-Roebuck, made the following statement:
An employee earning $25 a week would, on the basis of the past two years' record, have accumulated in 20 years' service, approximately $2i0,0'00. An employee earning $50 a week would in the same period of service have accumulated $40,000. It is estimated that this is a minimum!
I quote this merely as an instance of the possibility of developing co-operation between working classes and employers in order to bring about greater contentment
and a better opportunity for living well in this world. The other view that I have here was expressed by a manufacturer from Brantford, Ontario, merely giving his idea of a scheme that might be adopted to encourage better relations between employers and employees:
1.-The payment of a fair living wage. The happiness of the workingman will not depend on whether he has an eight or nine-hour day-
That may be considered a contradiction of the argument I have advanced in relation to the eight-hour day, but I am giving it simply as the view of this gentleman.
but on ensuring him a wage sufficient to keep his family comfortably and permit them to enjoy the good things of life.
(2)	The organization of sick benefit associations in connection with factories, similar to the Massey-Harris plan, the benefit to amount to say, $8 per week.
(3)	Every manufacturer should insure his employees, so that in case of bereavement the family will have something to carry on with.
(4)	Provision for old and faithful employees in the way of pensions when they retire.
(5)	The taking of the employee into partnership to the extent of each man's earnings. If he earns $1,000 he should be paid the same dividend on that amount as is paid the shareholder. It would encourage men to be faithful and to look after the interests of the business, because in so doing they would also benefit.
Having expressed these views as regards what capital should do to remove some of the grievances of labour, I would say this in regard to the position that organized labour should take. One grievance that the employer has and, I think, has justly, is that when he engages what might be termed a union man, he is not always guaranteed that the man is efficient for the work he is engaged to do. Labour should see that every man who is provided with a union card is efficient, and is entitled to earn the wage that is paid to him. It should also see that when an agreement is made with an industrial concern, that agreement is kept, not only by the union but by the employer. If we could bring about a proper understanding between labour and industry, I am satisfied that all agreements would be observed and that we could have a guarantee of efficiency.
I may be a little advanced in expressing the view that we should encourage labour representation in the House of Commons. I believe many of the problems we have to deal with to-day would be solved a good deal more easily i.f we had in the House a few men who represented the views of labour, and we do not have them here at the present time and we should encourage them. That would be an advantage not

only to the Government, but to Parliament and the country. Probably one way in which we could bring about a proper representation of labour would be by the adoption of proportional representation in Canada.
I have listened to the remarks of the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre (Mr. Andrews), and I am inclined to think that while at the beginning the difficulty in Winnipeg may have originated with reasonable labour men, it got into the hands of unreasonable labour men and I believe the One Big Union is at the back of the movement there. I have no sympathy whatever with the One Big Union, because no organization in Canada that expresses sympathy with Bolshevism and the Spartacans in Germany could have my sympathy, and as I understand it, the One Big Union, when created in Calgary, expressed sympathy with those movements. What I want to see is a development in Canada along constitutional lines, and we should keep as much as possible in advance, but I do not think the reasonable labour people of Canada have any sympathy whatever with the movements in Russia and Germany along revolutionary lines.
I have no disagreement with the principle of collective bargaining, as I understand it in my business and as I know it exists at the present time in the Canadian Pacific. If I might be personal and explain the method adopted in dealing with the International Typographical Union, collective bargaining is simply this: The International Typographical Union, in the city of Lethbridge, represents the employees in all the printing and job offices. And when we come to negotiate an agreement with the union we negotiate it with the employees of all the offices, and representatives of the employers meet representatives of the employees. That, in my judgment, is collective bargaining; but if collective bargaining goes beyond that and means that men in the baking, or milling, or moulding business are going to decide whether an agreement in another line of business is to be accepted or not, then I disagree with collective bargaining along that line. But if it is to be bargaining between men and employers in a certain line of business, then I am quite satisfied to have it generally adopted throughout Canada.
It would be in the interest of Canada that we should remove a good deal of the suspicion that exists between employers and employees and between employees and employers. I know the employer is under the

difficulty that he is suspicious of the motives of his employees, and on the othei hand the employee has the same suspicion wben dealing with the employer. I do not say that is always the case, but it is the case to a very great extent.
If we can get the heads of the industries of the country to trust and co-operate with the men in their employ to a greater extent than they have done in the past, 1 believe we shall remove a great many of the difficulties that have arisen. If I may make another reference to that book of Lord Leverhulme, one of his principles was this: "" Trust labour whole-heartedly and wisely, and all will be well."" Lord Leverhulme, one of the greatest employers of labour in the Mother Country, has been able to get along well with labour by cooperating with and trusting the men, and I feel that if we develop that feeling of trust in this country we shall alleviate many of the difficulties that have existed.
In conclusion, I would urge the Government to consider the organization of a permanent commission-I am not going to try and foist on the Government another commission, but I think it would be in the interest of labour and capital in this country if we had a commission somewhat of the same type as the Railway Commission to move about the country and consider difficulties that might arise, and try and solve them before they develop into a strike, when sometimes the difficulties are almost impossible of solution. There are many little differences and difficulties that occur in industries that, with a proper presentation of the case to an impartial tribunal could, I am satisfied, be solved before they had reached the stage where they are beyond solution and where a strike develops. It might be difficult to form in Canada a commission that could cover the whole country, and it might be necessary to have it divided so as to deal with East and West, because the commission would undoubtedly be kept busy meeting individuals from the Atlantic to the Pacific who had representations to make. I feel that it is our duty at this really critical period in the history of industry in Canada to get together, not only those who sit on the Opposition side but those who sit on the Government side as well, and do all that is possible to bring about a solution of these problems, in order that we may have peace and become the Canada that the men who fought and died for us in France aimed to possess when they came back to this country.

NICKLE (Kingston):,,J006 COMMONS,,,"I do not know whether I can usefully add anything to this discussion, as when I came to the House this afternoon I had not the slightest intention of seconding the resolution of the hon. member for North Winnipeg (Mr. Blake), but when he wanted a seconder I was very glad to lend my name so that the matter might be discussed.
In the discussion that has taken place it seems to me that we are to an extent not appreciating the changed conditions that have taken place, particularly in Winnipeg. Like the hon. member for North Winnipeg and the hon. member for Lethbridge (Mr. Buchanan), tl have endeavoured to secure as best I could a correct appreciation of the development of the facts in reference to the Winnipeg strike. I agree with wnat the Lon. member for North Winnipeg says in this respect, that the strike was originally precipitated probably because the ironmasters were unwilling to recognize collective bargaining,. that term being accepted in the ordinary sense. It means the ironmasters were not prepared to recognize the organizations within their own shops as having the right to speak and bargain for those whom they represent. There was also the question of hours and wages, but the crucial issue over which the cleavage occurred was whether or not collective bargaining should be recognized by the ironmasters, and this, as I understand it, was refused by them. But when the break toox place a change came o'er the spirit of the dream. The Central Strike Committee came into existence, and as the strike continued that committee became more aggressive in the demonstration and assertion of its point of view. Collective bargaining in the narrow sense of the word gave way to a different collective bargaining as being demanded. The collective bargaining, as I understand it, that is demanded to-day is not the collective bargaining that was refused by the ironmasters, and which, I may say in passing, I think they would have been wise in granting, but it is a new collective bargaining. It is a collective bargaining that recognizes tne right of a central strike committee to determine and bargain for the rate of wages and other conditions, not in respect of any particular employment, but in respect of any employment where there may be a difference. That changes the entire situation. It takes the bargaining away from the employees of a factory or craft and turns it over to a recognized outside committee, who shall have power to determine what the rate of wages and conditions shall 192
be in any particular industry or craft. The hon. member for Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe) was Keen in directing attention to this point. It seems to me he overlooked another fundamental point when he laid emphasis on the fact that the extreme socialistic view as represented by the Independent Workers of the World refused to recognize collective bargaining in any sense. To be consistent, the Independent Workers of the World and those who hold their views must be unwilling to accept collective bargaining in any of its phases, because they are unwilling to recognize the position of capital in industry. They are unwilling to recognize bargaining at all because, they say, there should be no such thing as capital in industry, that labour and the community are the only two parties interested in industry. In other words, that industry should not either directly or indirectly be affected by capital, but that labour, as the operators of industry, and the community that purchases the goods are the only two parties concerned, and that therefore there should be no collective bargaining because it is impossible for one party to bargain with himself. Labour is to take control of industry, and therefore labour could not bargain with itself in control. But to a very great extent that is theoretical.
Coming now to the practical, -we are face to face to-day in Canada and throughout the world with conditions that have confronted belligerent nations at the conclusion of all great wars, namely, unrest and high prices of foods, but there never was a time in the history of the world when a war produced such world-wide conditions, and the problem that confronts us to-day Teally is this: The immensity of -the task that we have just completed has practically put all the world -at one, in that high prices prevail not only in the countries which took part in the war but in other countries throughout the iw-orld. If hon. members interested in this discussion will turn to the last copy of the Labour Gazette which we secured in our boxes a day or so ago they will see that the cost of staple foods in the family budget has risen from $7.34 in 1913 to $13.35 to-day, and that the grand total of -the budget, as mentioned by the hon. member for Peterborough (Mr. Burnham), has risen from $14.02 to $21.34. But, Sir, these conditions are nbt confined to Canada. They are world-wide, and as I shall not be here to-night, and have but a few moments at the present time, I shall but roughly direct the attention of the House to -some of the conditions one finds
REVISED ED:TION

throughout the world. In the United States, for instance, prices have tremendously increased. The Canada Labour Gazette says:
The index number of the retail prices of foods in the United States calculated1 by the Bureau of Labour Statistics showed a considerable decrease for February, being down to 172, as compared with 185 for January, 187 for December, 1918, and 183 for November, 1918, and 160 for January, 1918, and 100 for the year 1913.
The normal price is taken as 100.
In the United Kingdom the Minister of Labour reported the retail prices of food to be 113 per cent higher on April 1st than in July 1914, as compared with a level 120 per cent the month before	
In Norway the statistical officer reported the cost of living for a family in November, 1918, to be 155 per cent higher than in July, 1914.... In retail food prices at Borne an advance of 1.8 per cent was reported in January, the level being 159 per cent higher than before the war. In Milan the cost of. living for a family in February was calculated to be 253 per cent higher than before the war, food being up 298 per cent, clothing 274 per cent, heat and light 11'5 per' cent, while rent was unchanged.
In South Africa the increase was about 40 per cent. And thus it is throughout the whole World. The question naturally is, why is this so? And the difficulty is in obtaining the facts. If we could get all the facts, then probably we should be able to apply economic theories to them and more easily find a solution. The hon. member for Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe) said something which I was sorry to hear him say, because I think it only adds fuel to the fire that exists throughout the country. He directed the attention of the House and of the country to what he stated as a fact: That the food trusts, as he termed them, and the milling trusts, were responsible for the very large increase in the cost of living. He very briefly called attention to the immense profits made by these industries, and, by his speech, gave the House and the country to understand that if these tremendous profits had been swept away the result would have been a very substantial decrease in the cost of commodities supplied by these industries. Now, Sir, I read with great care the report of Mr. O'Connor when it was published, and I also read the report of the cold storage inquiry as conducted in Toronto and elsewhere; and I gave considerable attention to the report of the milling industry as prepared by Miss McKenna. If I understand the purport and finding of these reports, it was to the effect that while these industries, through the immensity of their overturn, made very large profits, yet if the profits in respect of
fMr. Nickle.]
each item of overturn were reduced to nothing it would practically have amounted to this, that the cost of foodstuffs would have been decreased by a negligible quantity. Not for a moment do I argue that these industries should be left with such large profits, but at a time like this, and such as we have experienced during the past four years, it is absolutely essential that production should be driven to the extreme, and you cannot expect men, while human nature is human nature, to conduct an industry unless it can be made profitable. Price must always be in excess of cost, if an industry is to be maintained; and if this Government had been unwise enough to put the margfn of profit so low that the industries could not have been successfully operated, then the industries would have closed. But I do think that the Government should take, as it did take- and probably should continue to take by way of taxes-a very large proportion of the unusual profits earned by these companies, because it is not difficult for me to understand the unrest that pervades the labour classes of the country when they see such stock as that of the Maple Leaf Milling Company growing from below par t.o within 160, and stock of the Dominion Textile Company which a short time ago wias 98, standing to-day somewhere in the neighbourhood of 120. What the working people of the country are asking is : Are we, after having contributed liberally of our flesh and blood to the cause of the country, to be called on at the present time to bear an unequal burden in relation to present day conditions? The hon. member for Matane (Mr. Pelletier) asked what was the cause of the unrest to-day; why were people willing to make sacrifices during the war and to-day were restive? It seems to me that the reason is this-and it is a fundamental reason-that, unless human nature changes, we will bear a great loss or suffer much in respect of a great gain that we anticipate, but will not bear the irritation of small things when we think we are being unjustly dealt with. And if I can gather the spirit of the labouring people to-day-and I may say that I have had in my riding three strikes within a year-the dissatisfaction that pervades their ranks is due to the fact that they know that increased wages have not brought them any greater comfort, and they are imbued with the idea that unusual and improper profits are being made by certain people. Now, Sir, when you consider the philosophy

that underlies wages, you have to realize that money is only a medium of exchange. Price is only the declaration of value in money, and value is the ratio of exchange of goods. What happened in Canada after the war broke out? We have not forgotten that within a few months following the outbreak of war there was great depression in the country and men were willing to work for anything, for the question resolved itself into the alternatives of work or starvation. Then munitions contracts began, and the cry was "" Full steam ahead, because the Allies want munitions."" Competition was eliminated because the need for munitions and war supplies was so great that the cost was immaterial. They had to be had, otherwise the war could not be successfully carried on; and none of us have forgotten those days in 1915 when we thought we had almost lost because we had not the shells and other necessary impedimenta of war, and as the demand for munitions became greater the cost of living increased. There was an inflation in currency, and you may have an inflation in currency in two ways:	First, because there is more
money in the country than there should be, and, for a second reason, money may be circulating more rapidly. You may have a direct and an indirect inflation, and we had both in Canada. Vast amounts of money were being poured out in Canada, and money was circulating with great rapidity from the manufacturer down through to the workman and into the bank; fresh loans were made and the money went round again. Men received higher wages than they had got before, and prices rose correspondingly. We had in Canada a condition that has been experienced by every country at war. Prices were enhanced, but so long as times were good people did not complain. Wages rose, perhaps always somewhat behind prices, but there was a steady increase in wages in ratio to the increase in prices. But then peace came and the workmen were confronted with changed conditions. In all economic papers throughout the world,- and in our own newspapers, articles appeared which directed the attention of the workman to the fact that in the future he must look to a reduction of wages, because it was impossible, if Britain was to carry on her export trade and if Canada expected to conduct her business and secure trade, and to undertake the payment of her debts, for wages to remain as they were. Wages must come down, it was pointed out, 192A
because, in international trade, goods would be bought from the country which could most cheaply supply them. The workmen began to look around and to consider what their condition would be. One most thoroughly conversant with labour economics and world-wide conditions and a man of extensive knowledge in my riding, said to me: ""I have worked and slaved during the war and never had such wages before. But the day after the war was over I found myself no better off than before the war, and all I have earned is gone, having been swallowed up in the cost of living."" As a panacea for this evil-because the high cost of living is an evil-some gentlemen in this House advocate the -control of prices. It is a popular policy to shout that profiteering shall be stopped, but i't all depends on how you define your term. What is profiteering? Is profiteering to be defined as a reasonable effort by a man to produce his goods at the minimum of cost and sell them at the highest reasonable price? Or is profiteering to be regarded as the securing of monopolistic control, and by that control the lessening of supplies and the securing of prices out of proportion to the value of the goods? The first is quite justifiable, and if my views are worth anything in this House today, what I would urge is increased production. But if profiteering means, according to the second definition, the controlling of supplies and the -creation of a monopoly, and the taking advantage of the conditions so created to secure more than the article is worth, then profiteering should be condemned. But, Sir, the control of prices, is not as simple a matter as it appears to be. During the war France tried i-t and failed. According to a statement contained in Bulletin No. 27 of the Department of History and Political and Economic Science, Queen's University:
The Food Controller of France compares himself to a game keeper surrounded- by poachers and laments ""that the tradespeople and m;ddle men have invented no end of tricks to evad-e his prescriptions, and this he blames for his embarrassments.""
The control of prices was also tried in Germany-a country whose people had been accustomed to control, who were used to paternal government and to submit without complaint to governmental regulations.
The food controller of Germany said that he had utterly failed because ways were found by which the wealthy secured supplies from those who produced them, with the result that the condition of the poorer

people was worse with the control of prices than without. Mr. Hoover frankly admitted to the people of his country that price control could not be successfully operated.
In Canada conditions were such that the fishermen on the Pacific coast laid up their vessels because they were not able to make a living at the prices that were to be paid for fish. I only direct attention to this because I should be sorry to see the Government adopt a scheme that failed in other countries, and because I am satisfied that the last condition in this country would be worse than the first. The moment you adopt a food price that places the value, or the price, of a given article at less than the cost of production-because as I said at the beginning, no man will produce unless he can sell for more than it costs to produce-just so soon will the production fall off.
From the information I have been able to obtain from those who should know, and with whom I have discussed the question, it is evident that the great want in Canada to-day is agricultural production. We are an agricultural people. A great many of our young men went overseas. We have made a contribution to the war that I shall never regret. I do not agree with the hon. member for Matane (Mr. Pelletier) when he says that we impaired our national usefulness by the magnificent contribution that we made to the winning of the war. That is a contribution that our people will always be proud of and one which has placed Canada in a most enviable position in the eyes of the world. But, we would he blind to facts if we forgot that taking 450,000 or 500,000 of our men from the ordinary channels of industry has lessened the output of our industries. We would be blind to facts if we forgot that the destruction of war has robbed the world of a large part of the raw materials -used by the industries of Canada and other countries in their operations. We would be blind if we overlooked the fact that for the past four or five years a great majority of the young men of the world have been engaged in destruction rather than construction. Keeping all these points in view, I suggest that the Government should be careful not to make a move in the wrong direction, because if they start out wrongly, conditions will be worse than they are to-day.
I realize that discontent exists among the working people. I realize that they are not satisfied with their status. I do not know *whether or not a solution of the difficulty
IMr. Nickle.]
will be found in the Whitley report or not. It seems to me -that the principle embodied in that document has reference to conditions as they are in England more particularly than to the conditions as they 'are in Canada. In Great Britain the various crafts and trades are more closely co-ordinated than they are in Canada. We are a more scattered people and I doubt very much if the principles of the Whitley report could apply to Canada. But I say that the status of the working people has to be improved in this country. I do feel that the time has come when the demand of the working people for an eight hour day should be recognized-eight hours for five days a week, four hours on Saturday, Saturday afternoon for recreation and Sabbath for worship. I quite realize that it is impossible for this Government, within our constitutional limitations, to prepare and pass an eight hour day law but I do believe that the legislatures ought to give serious consideration to it.
Although I seconded the motion of my hon. friend from Winnipeg (Mr. Blake) this afternoon, I would not want to be understood as agreeing with every contention that he put forward. He stated two propositions at least this afternoon in which I think he is radically wrong. One is, if 1 understood him correctly, that he seemed to stand for the curtailment of free speech. I believe that is a mistake. I have always been impressed with the fact that there is safety in free speech. When in London and Glasgow in 1916 I heard it on the street corners and in public places. While in Glasgow I heard things said that were much more radical than .anything I had ever heard in Canada. While in Hyde Park I heard views expressed such as we are not accustomed to hear in this country. I have always felt that the free speech enjoyed in Glasgow and London was the safety valve of the people. If you give men an opportunity of voicing their views, while you may not agree with them you have an opportunity of refuting them. It is better to have views expressed in the open than in the byways and secret places.
Nor would I agree with the hon. member for Winnipeg that sympathetic strikes should be prevented by legislation. I do not believe that would get you anywhere. If you are going to recognize the right of collective bargaining as usually understood, if you are going to recognize the right of men to strike if they are not satisfied with the conditions of their employment, then you must recognize the right of those who are not satisfied with the recognition

being obtained by others of their craft to strike in sympathy and legislation against sympathetic strikes would not get you anywhere. It would make confusion worse confounded. It would make the unrest greater in Canada in the future than it is to-day. The parts in respect of which the Lemieux Act has failed are not the positive portions of the Act but those parts which say ""Thou shalt not."" Positive legislation is what is required and while I sympathize with some of the views advanced by the hon. member for Lethbridge (Mr. Buchanan), I want to urge the Government to be careful not to do something that will make conditions worse than they are to-day, but to do something that will bring employees and employers together, that will recognize the desire of labour for an improved status and that will bring at least harmony out of the discord that prevails in Canada. It is useless to say that this discord is mainly fomented by the foreigner. Vancouver, Victoria, and Calgary, are the homes of the strongest English-speaking groups that you have in any place in Canada and there is no place where the voice of discontent is more loudly heard than in these three cities.

This silence of ours has been variously construed. We have been told, and have heard, that we feared to handle the situation. We have been told, too, that our silence may be attributed to our desire to allow the Government to remain embedded in the mire to which its own actions have brought it. But I think I can safely say, and in doing so I am speaking for everybody on this side, that we considered the situation too serious to attempt to inflame the minds of the public whose patience has already been stretched almost to the breaking point, and that we considered it was well to allow the Government ample time and opportunity to propose a solution and to come to a satisfactory settlement of the present unrest. We considered that it was possible for the Government to bring about, by legislation, by arbitration, or by some means, economic and industrial peace in
Canada. We have waited, as I have said, two whole weeks, and what has happened? We have the spectre of revolution, which first became apparent two weeks ago, appearing like a hydra-headed monster in dozens of Canadian cities. We have in cities everywhere, from Halifax to Vancouver, with the possible exception of those in the province of Quebec, which I am glad to say are as yet untouched by the prevailing malady, industrial unrest; we have an upheaval such as this Dominion has never seen. ' And, if we are to believe the reports of the press, anarchy is being openly advocated, revolt is being encouraged, and grim revolution stalks unmolested through the cities of our country.
The lime therefore has come for us to face the situation, and I am convinced that we will do so, not in a cowardly, vacillating fashion, but in the manner in which we have for four years faced the issue of war- as men, conscious of our duty, proud of our common heritage and steadfast in our purpose to maintain justice and advance the common welfare.
In order to come to a proper understanding of our situation, it is perhaps well to go back to those first principles which should be the mainspring of any action in the relations between man and man. These relations have become more and more complex as our civilization has advanced, and in modern times we are occasionally at a loss in our endeavours to establish a code for their proper determination; but the principles themselves are as immutable as the laws of nature, as old as the human race, as true to-day as they were when the tablets were delivered to Moses, or when the Saviour of the world delivered his sermon on the Mount.
Applying these principles to the relation of capital and labour, it is possible to enunciate certain truths which are generally admitted. These truths have found their best-expression in modern days in an encyclical of His Holiness, Pope Leo XIII, from which I expect to quote at great length. These truths can be summed up somewhat as follows:	The condition of the worker is
primarily of the utmost concern to the State:	He should not be allowed to be
exploited by capital as a mere instrument for the making of money; hence it is unjust that the fruits of man's sweat and labour should not belong to him:	As a
rule it is quite legitimate for the worker and the capitalist to bargain; but there comes a time when, driven by fear, necessity, or otherwise, the labourer finds it im-

possible to make a bargain which will give him sufficient to gain a frugal, honest and honourable living: When that time comes it is the duty of the State to see that the labourer is not oppressed by the capitalist -to enable the employee to make a fair bargain with his employer:	Further,
the standard of living should not be the minimum at which the worker can keep body and soul together; there should be given to him a wage sufficient to provide him with comfort and recreation, to enable him to educate his family, and to provide against accident, sickness, and old age: To establish this standard, it is essential that the workers unite, for experience teaches us that man is naturally greedy, and the rich and powerful will rarely concede anything to the poor unless coercion is applied:	It is the duty of the State,
therefore, to foster and encourage such unions when the poor have not the same facilities for protecting themselves as the rich: It is also the duty of the State as much as possible to remove all causes of complaint between employer and employee, to prevent by remedial measures, taken beforehand, any recourse to the strike, which is invariably a great economic loss, in many cases most seriously affecting those not intimately concerned in the struggle, and always leaving rancour and bitterness in its train. It is neither justice nor humanity to grind men down and stunt their minds with labour of their bodies: Daily labour must be regulated so that it is not protracted beyond the strength of the workers. In all agreements between master and workman it is implied that proper leisure be left to the workman for rest, recuperation and recreation.
Now, having laid down these principles, let us examine the present situation. The demands of the men on strike, if I understand them rightly, are somewhat as follows:	first, recognition of their unions;
second, an eight hour day; third, collective bargaining.
With regard to the first, recognition of The unions, it is so generally admitted that the necessity for argument is scarcely apparent. Besides, I have an Order in Coun-[DOT]cil of July, 1918, in which it is stated:
That all employees have the right to organize in trade unions, and this right shall not be ^denied or interfered with in any manner whatsoever, and through their chosen representatives should be permitted and encouraged to negotiate with employers concerning working conditions, rates of pay, or other grievances.
tMr. Power.]
So there is no doubt that the Government acknowledges that the unions are to be recognized.
The second point, the eight-hour day, presents, perhaps, more difficulty. But bearing in mind that the sweating of employees is a most inhuman and immoral act, we have to come to the conclusion that under the strain of modern industrial conditions a man cannot work very much more than one-third of the twenty-four hours. This fact had been scientifically proved before the war; but it became more generally admitted when a commission of the British Government on the health of munition workers found that the efficiency of the labourers was augmented and that their health was better undeir an eighhhour working day than under a nine-hour or ten-hour working day. Ten hours work was found over-fatiguing and incompatible with the highest efficiency. Further, since the labourer is entitled to a certain time for rest and recreation, we must at least take that time from the ordinary ten hours of work. The members of the American National War Board on July 20, 1918, issued a memorandum on the eight-hour working day, and their conclusion was as follows:
The way to crime and chaos lies' plainly in the exploitation of our men and our women as if they were coal or oil. In our free America there is to be industrial and social freedom. Out of the ferment of unrest there has already begun to come a truer sense of the human values; a better adjustment of law to those values; a keener conscience as to the treatment of those values and the conservation which shall not stop with saving water or wood, but will make its greatest and more fruitful task the conserving of our people themselves.
So that we find it generally admitted in Europe and in America that an eight-hour day increases efficiency, promotes health, and helps' towards the happiness of the labourer.
Now I come to what is, perhaps, the most difficult of the demands made by the workmen-that is, collective bargaining. It is generally admitted that unions of any particular craft or trade should be recognized, and should be allowed to bargain with their employers.
But it is not generally admitted that, for instance, the employer of a metal worker can be asked to bargain with regard to the wages of that worker with a typesetter or a carpenter. This is the objection which,
I understand, has been voiced by the Winnipeg Citizens' Committee, and also by the

Minister of Labour. If we admit that a worker may bargain collectively in a given trade, I hardly see how we can deny him the right to bargain as a class. We have already granted different classes in this country the right to bargain as a class. Lawyers, for instance, in every province in Canada, have their bar associations or societies, and they not only bargain, but have their bargains, arrangements and fees consecrated by Acts of Parliament. The farmers-and all farmers are not the same kind of farmers, because there are different classes of farmers-are now endeavouring to bargain with the Government with regard to the tariff, although I do not know with how much success. The manufacturers -and there are many different classes of manufacturers-are also endeavouring to bargain collectively with the Government. Therefore, if one class, the farmer class, or barrister class, or manufacturing class, is allowed to bargain as a class collectively, I cannot understand why the labourer should not be allowed to do the same.
As I have already said, capital is invariably greedy of its privileges, it invariably seeks to obtain further privileges; and it can hardly obtain these further privileges except at the expense of the man who produces the capital. Therefore, if we are to remain in the present state; that is to say where one trade bargains with its employer, we might be in such a situation as this. We might find a strike of metal workers, such as we have, in which the employers would win. The strikers would be obliged to return to their work and the increase in wages and the better conditions of labour which they demanded would not be granted. I have no doubt that other capitalists, encouraged by this victory and using the military tactic of destroying one enemy after another, would be very pleased to emulate the victory of the metal men, and, one by one, our trade unions would be destroyed or rendered impotent. I, therefore, hardly think it is possible for us to admit the right of one trade, one craft to strike and not admit the right of all other labourers in the same locality or even in the same country to bargain collectively with regard to their own conditions, providing they have a common interest, and in the class which we have before us there is a common interest. There is a general demand in Canada for an eight-hour day. There is very little more to be said as regards the sympathetic strike. If we admit the principle of collective bargaining, there is absolutely no reason why we should not admit the principle of a
sympathetic strike. The same arguments apply in both cases, and if we admit recognition of the unions and collective bargaining, we should admit the principle of sympathetic strikes.
There is a question whether or not we should admit the advisability and the possibility of a strike amongst the servants of the State. By servants of the State, I mean those who serve a Government, whether federal, provincial or municipal. The condition of the worker under the State is somewhat different from that of the worker under the private capitalist. The former is assured, first of all of a permanent position; he receives his wages, and he knows that through political action he may be able to obtain higher wages. I do not think anybody can reasonably object to his striking, but we can all reasonably object to his joining a sympathetic strike. He, after all, is the servant of the people of Canada; he, after all, is administering or operating utilities for the whole of the people of Canada. The postal clerk is delivering the mail; the fireman is putting out fires; the policeman is the bulwark of law .and order. The same reasons which apply in favour of allowing a sympathetic strike in other trades apply in favour of prohibiting a strike amongst the servants of the State, because the latter can, by direct political action, increase their salaries, improve their conditions and establish a condition whereby their wishes may be met. The civil servant has not been sweated by the ordinary profiteer; he is the servant of the State, and should things not satisfy him, be has a good weapon in his hand-the ballot. Therefore, we should admit recognition of the union, the eight-hour day, collective bargaining, the right of civil .servahits to strike, but not the right of civil servants to join a .sympathetic strike.
It would, perhaps, be well to examine a little into the causes of the present unrest. There is, I admit, a general world-wide cause. We have just been through the greatest war in history; commerce has been dislocated, and if I may say so, our population has, to a certain extent, been brutalized. We have found that might and force have been the only means whereby justice and humanity have been able to conquer, so that in .spite of ourselves we have come to the conclusion that if we are right, we must fight. Therefore, amongst the people of Canada, as amongst other people throughout the world, the feeling ha*

arisen that we should have no patience; that we should proceed at once to obtain what is ours. This feeling is general, and it is probably brought about by the conditions of the last four years. But we cannot altogether blame on the world-wide war the state of unrest into which our country has been brought. There is no doubt that some time before the war the labouring classes were in a state of ferment. We had strikes; we had threatened strikes; we had unemployment; the conditions of labour were by no means normal.
However, we have found that in the four years of the war the world has advanced probably two or three generations, and that which satisfied the people before the war will satisfy them no longer. We have also found that there has been something wrong with our economic system. To quote a newspaper which I read recently;
The traditions of law show more respect for *property than for the person-more for Capital than for the Labour that makes wealth. This is all wrong. And labour does well to try by every honourable means in its power to procure for itself equal justice. Labour has as good a right as Capital to collective bargaining. Capital is doing it all the time in spite of laws to the contrary. As well might the Kaiser have attempted to dispute the right of the Allies to make Poch their generalissimo, as for capital to dispute allied labourers right to unity of action and collective bargaining.
The world has changed, and we cannot judge men and affairs by the standards which we would have used four or five years ago. To come down.to the more particular causes of the strike, we have found, to quote again the same paper, which dn turn quotes from one of the Winnipeg papers, I think tihe Labor News:
The Government was indifferent to it all. It appointed food controllers who did not control. It recommended titles for profiteers. It muzzled criticism, suppressed free speech, strangled independent newspapers, censored the truth and imprisoned the protesters. It let contracts to its patrons, and so by sharing in the plunder rendered itself impervious to protest and indifferent to need.
We find that the Government of this country, in disregard of our constitution and our traditions issued during some eight or nine months decrees as tyrannical and ukases as evil as ever were issued by the Bolshevik government of Russia or by its predecessor the Czar himself. Order in Council after Order in Council was issued until at last the people decided that they would no longer have any respect for them. The Government considered Parliament useless, Parliament was not summoned in any crisis whatsoever, but an Order in Council was passed; and, whether right or wrong,

the result was always the same-to bring into still greater disrepute the law and constitution of our country.
The policy of the Government with regard to the labour situation has been weak and vacillating. It reminds me of nothing so much as the policy of the last king of France before the Revolution, who, when the revolutionists were crying at the gates of his palace, was one moment for granting them a National Assembly and the next, for sending the ring-leaders to the Bastille. It might be likened also to the policy of the Czar just before the revolution, when one moment he was for summoning the Duma, and the next for letting loose the most reactionary elements in that country. And so with the Government of this country. In July, 1918, a set of pious ejaculations were issued by the late lamented Minister of Labour (Mr. Crothers). We were told what the relations of capital and labour ought to be. The capitalist was told to be good, the labour man was told to be good, we were all told to be good; but no solution was found for the difficulty. Still later, after a trip West of the Minister of Public Works (Mr. Carvell) an Order in Council was issued on October 11, 1918, in which it was decreed:
Any male person, employer or employee, of military age, 'as defined1 by the Military Service [DOT] Act, who violates any of the regulations above-mentioned shall be subject to the military law for the duration of the present war and de-mobilzation thereafter, and shall forfeit any exemption granted him and any right to obtain exemption under the Military Service Act.
As hon. gentlemen will remember, that raised a storm of protest throughout the country, and on the 2nd of November the Order in Council was amended. Later on, when we were still in<the period of demobilization, an Order in Council was issued on November 19, 1919, repealing the previous Orders in Council and providing:
That the Government is informed that concerted movements are now under way on the part of employers and workmen respectively which aim at improved relations as between employers and workmen, and looking to the elimination, so far as may be practicable, of lockouts and strikes in connection with Industrial disputes.
'I am very glad the Government was informed of that, and I would have been still more glad had their hopes been well founded. Unfortunately, shortly after this pronouncement from the Government, the unrest became acute, culminating in the present strikes at Winnipeg, Vancouver and elsewhere.
We have, therefore, as one of the proximate causes of the present unrest the diffi-

culty which the Government has found in demobilization. I do not intend to go into this question at any great length. Many theories have been advanced as to whether demobilization should proceed more rapidly or more slowly, but we have found this: The Government, despite all its agencies-its employment agencies, its land settlement scheme, its war-service gratuity scheme, and even its pension scheme-has been unable to find work for the returned soldier, and unable to provide for the dislocation of industry consequent on the armistice. The Government have been unable in any way to prevent or forestall the unrest which it was patent to any one of us would follow the conclusion of the war.
The cost of living has been going up by leaps and bounds, and there has been no attempt to prevent or control it on the part of the Government. I do not wish to tire the House by quoting the figures of the percentage of rise for all the countries in the world, but I might mention the increase that has taken place since 1914 in the following countries: United Kingdom, 120 per cent; France, 137 per cent; Sweden, 220 per cent; Canada, 84 per cent; United States, 75 per cent. One hon. gentleman stated today that in New Zealand the cost of living had gone up higher than my figures show, but if my figures are correct, and I have reason for thinking so, the cost of living in New Zealand in October, 1918, had increased only 42 per cent. So it will be seen that the increase in the cost of living in Canada has been exceeded only in European countries subject to blockade conditions. Compared with all other countries except these the increase in the cost of living in Canada is by far the highest.
It has increased considerably more than in the United States. There is twice the increase suffered by New Zealand and nearly two and-a-half times that in Australia. In one paper it is stated:
For four years our Government has permitted and even fostered one of the most nefarious following now to become organized into a band of middlemen, which is as great a curse upon the country as the cold storage octopus. It has an army of agents running wild through the country buying up everything in and out of sight upon the farms, giving the farmers such fabulous prices that it not only unsettles and sometimes prevents them from taking advantage of the normal rise in prices, but they themselves are admitting that the produce is not worth the prices that they are being sold for in the city of Quebec.
The excuse is that there is a shortage of food in Europe. If there is a shortage of food in Europe, where there is revolution and strife, is that any reason why we
should export more of our surplus and create the same labour unrest at home? Would it not be better to take the bull by the horns and bring down the high cost of living by spending millions immediately in building cold storage houses and controlling the farmers' produce, so that there may be normal prices, only charging sufficient commission to pay the working expenses of the cold storage plants? Then, again, can we not make a law to imprison the dishonest promoter and speculator by making it an offence punishable by imprisonment for middlemen to engage in speculation?
There is another reason for this general unrest. I think the Government is, to some extent at least, responsible for it. The wealthy people of Canada have not been judicious in the manner in which they have enjoyed their wealth. It is said:
The wage-earner is measuring his income against the evidences of luxury, advertisements of ladies' dresses at prices that have to support a family for a year, and not too much of them at that. Gentlemen's neckties at from five to fifteen dollars, and all else in proportion- goods whose commendation evidently is their dearness. Daily appear such appeals to fashion luxury in the newspapers as might well be called immoral in their encouragement to ungainly waste. Meantime, the wage-earner reads with rage of millions made out of war necessities, and of one claim upon the government, that he has to support, for eighteen million dollars, which a contractor would have made had his product not been rejected. He stands aghast at such figures, and, in his corporate capacity of trades unionist, he rebels against it. Here is the way the Winnipeg worker sees it: ""During all these fearful years the rich became richer and the poor poorer, and with the increase of wealth the arrogance of the wealthy increased. Their wealth did not make them more beneficent. It made them mad for still more wealth. They became more and more callous and indifferent to the needs of the masses.""
I charge the Government with responsibility, even though indirect, for this condition of things, in that they allowed this profiteering. They .allowed great wealth to be made in munitions and in the sale of supplies to our Allies, and people made wealthy through the instrumentality of the Government used their wealth most injudiciously. We have been told that we have in this country a very undesirable element-the Bolshevik!-and that in Winnipeg this element is in control. I am not fully apprised of all the circumstances of the strike in Winnipeg, but so far as I can see there is little on the part of the labour men except a just and legitimate claim of labour to enjoy the fruits of its labour and to enjoy better conditions. But it is be-

coming the habit in this country to designate every one a Bolshevist with whom we cannot agree. This is a very old failing of the Tory party. For centuries any one who opposed the Tory party was always hailed as the Bolshevist of that day. I remember having read in my history of England of Lord Russell and Sydney having been called Whigs. They were hanged for saying and, indeed, for believing, that the King was not King by divine right. They were the Bolshevists of those days. And the Roundheads, the Puritans, were the Bolshevists of the day of Charles I and Charles II, because they dared to insinuate that the immorality and the bestiality of the courts of England of that time were not conducive to the proper government of the people of England. Later on people were condemned to the dungeons for being Liberals. Then it became a byword of reproach to call a man a Radical. We have learned a lot from the early Radicals, and we have learned a lot even from our own ""Radicals. Had it not been for the Liberals and the Radicals of this country we should not at the present time be enjoying responsible government! Men of the Family Compact in Ontario, I presume, called William Lyon Mackenzie a Radical; and yet, were it not for William Lyon Mackenzie,
I doubt whether we would be sitting here in this Parliament to-day. Again, men in Quebec who denied responsible government to the people of Quebec and Lower Canada, called Louis Joseph Papineau a Radical and drove him into exile. But had Louis Joseph Papineau and those associated with him not taken the stand which they took, I am very doubtful whether there would be responsible government in that province and whether we would be sitting here to-day. Later on still, the same attitude was held in regard to those whose views were different from the policies of the party in power, particularly the Tory party, and such persons were called Socialists. Yet we have taken a great deal from the Socialists. The present Government, Tory and all as it is, has adopted the naturalization of railways, something which thirty, forty or fifty years ago would have been considered extreme socialism. To come to our own day and to the present moment, any one who seems to oppose the Government is promptly described as a Bolshevist. Well, Mr. Speaker, if opposition to the Government, and if a desire to establish the rights of labour, and a wish to have it understood once for all that we in this country are opposed to anything which will rob labour of 
its dignity and nobility, is Bolshevism, then Sir, I am wilding to be called a Bolshevist. But if Bolshevism means the subversion of all authority; if it means anarchy; and if it means the government of the country by one class alone; lastly, if it means, as we have been told it does in Russia, the nationalization of women and the murder of all those who are opposed to the theories held by certain sections of the people, then undoubtedly I am opposed to it. And I think you will find that in expressing this opinion I am voicing the views of most of those who have seen service at the front. The ordinary returned soldier has been a labourer, and was such before the war and during the war. I should say, without hav-ig 'the exact figures at my disposal, that before the war fully 20 per cent of the army consisted of wage earners; and further that 60 to 75 per cent were those who worked with their hands as day labourers. These men cannot be expected to become strike breakers. You cannot expect them to lose sympathy with their fellow workers. You cannot expect them to enter into competition with the men at present engaged in manual labour. You cannot expect them in any way to help the capitalist, whom to a large extent they blame for the late war. You cannot expect them to give up their own comrades and to put their services at the disposal of any person who has in view the victory of capital over labour.
He also knows what the promises of the Government are. He has been promised a great deal and given very little. He has his own troubles with them in connection with demobilization, pensions and gratuities and I consider that he is more apt to side with the worker than with the capitalist.
Having said all this, I think the least I should do is to suggest a remedy. A remedy would be to grant the demands of the strikers in so far as an eight-hour day and collective bargaining are concerned. In regard to the civil servants, if they do not want to go back to work, put somebody else in their places. In regard to the undesirable elements which we have in the country, or which I am told we have, if they are undesirable, if their theories and actions are such that we find that the free air of Canada does not suit them, let us deport them. Let us deport them whether they come from the slums of Warsaw from the ghettos of Rome, or whether they be the cockney off-scourings of Whitechapel or the dock rats of Liverpool. It matters not who they are, if they are undesirable citizens; I do not care where they come from; they are not fit to remain in

our country. We had been led to believe until to-day that this undesirable element in Western Canada was the foreign element. We find now that the leaders of the Winnipeg strike are not of the foreign element but are British born-the British born that we heard so much about a few years ago. If these men are not satisfied with the laws of our country as they are at present administered; if they are not satisfied with our manners and customs, deport them. I would like to quote from a little pamphlet entitled "" Social Reconstruction -A General Review of the Problems and Survey of Remedies."" It is signed by such a conservative body the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States. They say:
The labourer must come to realize that he owes his employer and society an honest day's work in return for a fair wage, and that conditions cannot be substantially improved until he roots out the desire to get a maximum of return for a minimum of service. The capitalist must likewise get a new viewpoint. He needs to learn the long-forgotten truth that wealth is stewardship, that profit-making is not the basic justification of business enterprise, and that there are such things as fair .profits, fair interest and fair prices. Above and before all, he must cultivate and strengthen within his mind the truth which many of his class have begun to grasp for the first time during the present war; namely, that the labourer is a human being, not merely an instrument of production ; and that the labourer's right to a decent livelihood is theT'first moral charge upon industry. The employer has a right to get a reasonable living out of his business', hut he has no right to interest on his investment until his employees have obtained at least living wages. This is the human and Christian, in contrast to the purely commercial and pagan, ethics of industry.
In conclusion, I have confidence in the Canadian workman. I have seen the Canadian workman in more difficult circumstances than those of to-day. I remember well the circumstances under which I saw the Canadian workman two years ago to-day when our trenches from Hooge to Mount' Sorrel had been completely wiped out. I saw the Canadian workmen counter-attack in broad daylight and in the face of numerous machine guns they never faltered. They carried on until there was hardly a man of them left and although they did not take the position on the first day they tried again and again and within two weeks every inch of the trench lost on the 2nd of June, every gun and every trench instrument that had been taken, were once more in the hands of the Canadian workman. Bearing that in mind I have no doubt that the man who was able to do that under those circumstances will be able to make arrangements whereby he will see to it that
he works for the greater prosperity and greater benefit of this country.

ARTHUR MEIGHEN (Minister oi the Interior):,Minister of the Interior; Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs,J006 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, the subject of debate does not concern directly any of the departments of the Administration for which I am just now responsible, but inasmuch as for the moment the seat of chief disturbance is in the province from which I come, and inasmuch as I had something to do with the study of the situation on the ground, I venture to intervene in the debate. The motion of my hon. friend from North Winnipeg (Mr. Blake) will have served a good end if it succeeds in throwing some light upon the age-long problem of the relations between capital and labour -and it can do no more than throw some light upon it-or if it succeeds in bringing into relief, and enabling us to study at close range, the difficult and concrete conditions under which that problem has taken acute form in Winnipeg and various cities of the country. It is wholly beyond hope that by any consideration this Parliament can give to it in any single debate, we can make any substantial progress .towards a solution of the world-wide problem of labour and capital. But perhaps it is not impossible that some ideas and principles may more clearly emerge whether merely precautionary, as were those with which the excellent speech delivered by the
9 p.m. hon. member for Kingston (Mr. Nickle) was replete, or whether of constructive positive policy, of which, I fear, so far every speech has been barren. In the struggle between labour and capital the history of the past has been the advance of the cause of labour, and the history of the future will he the same. No one can read the progress of the past or the signs of the times aright who is not prepared to admit that to the labourer belongs a larger, and ever larger, share of the product of his labour. Whenever legislation interferes it must be on behalf of the man behind. But merely stating a general principle like that does not lead us far in the consideration of any specific administrative acts that we can apply to the conditions that exist in this country.
The first thing necessary is to know the conditions that do exist and the causes that brought them about-what they are, and how far any general principle can be applied thereto. A general strike was declared in the city of Winnipeg on the 15th day of last month. Previous to that on the 10th day of the same month a strike had been

declared on the part of the employees of three concerns-the Dominion Bridge Company, the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Company, and the Vulcan Iron Works-of the city of Winnipeg.
The dispute between the employees of those companies and the companies was a dispute as to what part, if any, should be taken by a body of men elected by certain branches of labour known as the Metal Trades Council in the determination of the conditions of labour in the shops of those three concerns. It is commonly said in Winnipeg, and has often been repeated here, that the principle of collective bargaining was the principle upon which the two sides to that initial dispute split. In one sense that may possibly be correct, but a mere statement like that leads us nowhere, because collective bargaining in the form described by many members has never been denied, and is not claimed to have been denied, by any of the three companies who are taking part in this dispute.
Collective bargaining on the part of all three had been their practice for some time; so much so that one at all events, and I think all of them, had adopted the habit of each week consulting with shop committees of their men as to conditions in the factory, as to improvements that might be made, as to hours of labour and wages. That is to say the principle of collective bargaining had been applied, insofar as collective bargaining was constituted by the negotiations between any single concern and the employees of that concern as a body. That fact admits of no dispute.
On the other hand, however, it was contended on the part of the Metal Trades Council, which is affiliated with, or indeed a constituent part of the Trades and Labour Council of the city of Winnipeg, that a bargain made between the collective employees of a concern and that concern, should not stand as a bargain until it was ratified by the Metal Trades Council. To that the employers in each case objected. They placed their objections on the ground that the Metal Trades Council was constituted by men elected by bodies and by crafts who in large degree had no part in and had no relation to any craft engaged by them; on the further grounds that the Metal Trades Council as constituted was composed very largely of men elected by the Metal Trades of the railway companies, and that conditions that might obtain in the shops of the railway companies could not possibly apply to conditions in the competitive shops of the other companies, inasmuch as the one had to compete in the

markets and the other had not. However, it will be realized at a glance that there was a margin between the two sides to the controversy. There was a "" No Man's Land "" between. Collective bargaining by the employees in a single concern was not accepted as collective bargaining by the Metal Trades Council, nor by the Trades and Labour Council of the city. The employers, on the other hand, refused to extend, temporarily at all events, the principle of collective bargaining. They did, however, later agree that upon the establishment of anything in the nature of an organization between the employers themselves they would then be prepared to deal collectively with jthe united employees of the three concerns, or with a body of craftsmen of the description of those engaged by the three concerns, though there might be included outside parties not actually engaged by those concerns themselves.
It is only fair to those who went on strike to say that at the time the strike had been declared there was, so far as I know, no concession made of the willingness of the employers to negotiate otherwise than collectively with the employees of the three concerns respectively. Now in this relation it should be known at this stage, that in the opinion of the Minister of Labour the conception of collective employment, as entertained by the employers in that case was somewhat too narrow. fl&t was equally and very decidedly his opinion that the conception of collective employment, as contended for on the part of the Metal Trades Council, was so wide as to be impracticable and dangerous to the cause of labour itself. Hit is the opinion of the Minister of Labour that where there is an organization of employers, then it is the duty of that organization to deal collectively, not only with the united body of their own employees, but with at least single crafts and unions of employees, consisting not merely of their workmen but of men in the same trade or craft though employed by others.
The point at issue mainly is this, and the reason I will explain as I pass along: The employees contended that the Metal Trades Council should be supreme, that they should have the right of imprimatur and ratification of all engagements entered into by the employees of any concern with the management of that concern and the Metal Trades Council as constituted undoubtedly held within its personnel representatives of crafts that have nothing to do with the crafts engaged by the three concerns affected.

Now there are other elements in the controversy of which it is well that Parliament should have full knowledge. The Government of the province, chiefly through the spokesmanship of the Premier, had made strenuous endeavours to effect a reconciliation. In the course of its endeavours meetings were held and a proposal was made that everything in dispute, and the main thing was the principle of collective bargaining, because on the part of one at all events arrangements had really been arrived at between the employers and the employed, but had been refused ratification by the Metal Trades 'Council-a proposal was made that all the matters in dispute be referred to a board of arbitration, the personnel of which should be five, and all selected by the Prime Minister of the province. That w'as not concurred in on the part of the strikers. Then later on, and before the general strike-before the 15th day of May, when the general strike was declared-the Premier requested from the Trades and Labour Council, or the Metal Trades Council, I am not sure which and it does not make any difference-yes, he requested of the Trades and Labour Council, to know whether or not, if the principle of collective bargaining on the part of the Metal Trades Council were conceded by the employers the general strike would still take place, and to that request he received a negative reply. As to that there is no dispute, there can be no dispute. The general strike took place in the face of the denial of the president of the Trades and Labour Council-in the face rather of his assertion that it would take place whether or not collective bargaining on the part of the Metal Trades Council was acknowledged as a sound principle by the employers. Whether or not it would have been so acknowledged I cannot say, but at all events the contingency of its being acknowledged was refused on the part of the president of the Trades and Labour Council as sufficient to ward off the general strike. As a result the general strike took place. The industry of the city of Winnipeg was for the time being paralyzed ; public services were placed in a state of tie-up, and Winnipeg was virtually in a condition of isolation and siege.
Now, in discussing the inner principle of a general strike, and the rightness and the soundness of the action of a sympathetic strike, it is well to consider where action of that kind is bound to lead. It led in Winnipeg, as I say, to a general paralysis of the whole industrial structure of the city. It led to a denial of the necessities of life
to the people of that city, even to the strikers themselves.
And as a consequence inevitably it led to the establishment of a separate Government-or better, assertion of governmental functions on the part of those in charge of the strike itself. And why? Because it could not lead anywhere else. A general strike ties up all industries and all activities, and denies to all parts and elements of the community the service of the necessities of life, not only public service but each and every ministration, the delivery of bread, the distribution o,f milk, the circulation of water-indeed all things that are necessary for the protection and preservation of life. As a consequence, and in order that the strikers might themselves exist, they had to exercise control over the distribution of the necessities of life; they had to appropriate to themselves public services to which all the people had contributed; they had to declare that the public services were their property for the time being and could be used for their benefit alone. And they did so declare, and upon that declaration they acted. They had to declare, furthermore, that there should be such a distribution of water by which they themselves should be served, but by which many others should not be served at all; that there should be a distribution of the milk of the city, that whom they nominated should be provided but that the general public should be denied; they were further bound to declare that the very bread of life should be distributed to such as were named by them, but that it . should be refused to all others within the compass of the city of Winnipeg.
Those pretensions are an assertion of governmental authority. But the strike leaders were driven to make them if they were to continue effectively anything in the nature of a general strike. Consequently I say it is proved by the example of Winnipeg, and indeed follows inevitably from the very logic of the situation, that a general strike to succeed or, indeed, to continue, must result in the usurpation of governmental authority on the part of those controlling the strike. It did so result in Winnipeg; it must ever so result.
When that stage was reached, when that object lesson confronted the citizenship of Winnipeg, that citizenship was aroused and became organized, and as a consequence of that organization and of the united front it presented there was a rapid retirement on the part of those controlling the strike from the position of governmental authority

that they had assumed, and consequently and inevitably there was a reduction in the general strike itself, because the leaders could not continue the strike as an effective general strike without the maintenance at the same time of the exercise of the functions of 'Government. That is why in the last ten days the strike has not assumed the proportions and has not involved the hardship that it did in the early days of the struggle.
A sympathetic strike is, of course, essential if a general strike is to take place. A sympathetic strike is a strike on the part of a class of labour, based not upon any grievance of its own, but founded entirely upon sympathy for those involved in another quarrel. Hon. gentlemen opposite and also, I think, some hon. gentlemen on this side, have approved the principle of the sympathetic strike. Now, I do not want it to be assumed from what I shall say that there is any statutory office this Parliament can fill with regard to sympathetic strikes-at all events, any useful statutory office; there is, however, a function that any Government can exercise in this Dominion, and that is by making known where it stands on this question, and why it stands where it stands, and let that have its influence by way of conciliation, or by way of moral constraint.
Now, what I am arguing is that the sympathetic strike almost necessarily involves the violation of contracts. A union itself is based upon the principle of collective bargaining. A union cannot effect its purpose unless it can bargain as a union, and make its engagement with an employer or combination of employers. In a word, one of the principal functions of a union is to make an engagement on behalf of its constituents with the employer concerned. If, having made any such engagement it is to be free to break it by reason of the quarrels of others, then of what value is the engagement? As a result we found in the city of Winnipeg the remarkable spectacle of men in 'the city by the hundred, yes, I believe by the thousand, who were on strike, as they claimed, for the principle of collective bargaining, and who at the same moment were declaring that any bargain on their pant had no validity at all. In one breath they were saying: A collective bargain must be acknowledged on the part of the employers in this city. In the next breath they were saying: No bargain, collective or otherwise, has any force with us at all. Indeed they themselves were
f Air. Meighen.]
violating a collective bargain which they had made in one case only some few weeks before.
Now, it must be clear to hon. members that if the principle of the sympathetic strike, resulting in a general strike, is to be sound, then there can be no such thing as the sacredness of contracts-there can be no attribute of a bargain that would make a collective bargain of any value whatsoever. Therefore, I say that the Minister of Labour is sound and right when he declares that while a strike may be just when the balance of merit is on the side of the strikers, there is nothing that can justify a sympathetic strike in breach of a bargain; and there is nothing at any time that can justify a general strike involving upon the whole innocent community, the paralysis of industry, and the denial of the necessities of life.
In that condition of affairs we found Winnipeg when we visited it last week. We found at the same time a tremendous volume of public opinion well aroused and determined that assertion of government authority on the part of the strike leaders -or on the part of any one else-as opposed to the constituted authority of the country, should be at no time acknowledged by the-people of Winnipeg. And the citizens of Winnipeg in taking that position have rendered a service not only to their own city and province, but to this entire Dominion. They have shown an example to the citizens of this country that the body of sensible opinion in Canada can and will set its face decidedly and effectively against anything in the nature of a general strike-anything in the nature of a soviet or any other form of government inconsistent with constituted authority.
I do not think it is necessary for me to bring written evidence of the assumption of soviet or other irresponsible authority further than the facts that I have adduced as to the declaration of right, and indeed, the acting upon that declaration of right to control the distribution of the necessities of life. But if further evidence were needed all one has to do is to look up the columns of the Labour News of that city and read the statements of the strike leaders themselves, who openly declared that they were in control and intended to continue in control, although they said they intended to do so without bloodshed and without force. Just as if the whole principle of government of this country could be overturned without bloodshed and without force! But

it is apparent from a perusal of that paper that the strike leaders for a time believed themselves to be in possession of governmental power and were determined to exercise it, but were faced by an overpowering concentration of public opinion against which they could not avail.
Furthermore, the opinion had taken permanent root in that city that the issue that had given rise to the strike on the part of the employees of the three concerns was no longer the main or the present issue to be decided; that it had been swallowed up in a far greater issue, just as if a man or a class of men, in determining that (hey should assert a privilege of their own, had burned a city in reaching out for that privilege. Therefore, they said: Those who are fighting here for some form of collective bargaining have, to ensure the success of their claim, taken steps that are inconsistent with constituted Government, and they have raised an issue that entirely overshadows the first issue on whioh they went out on strike, an issue that must be decided once and for all before we return to weighing and determining the merits of the first cause of quarrel. In that position, I submit the citizens of Winnipeg were right.
It was essential that the greater issue raised by the assumption of Soviet authority-and it was nothing less on the part of those in control of the strike in the city of Winnipeg-should be once and for all decided and be decisively beaten down before they should concern themselves with the smaller and much less important issue upon whioh certain men had originally gone on strike. That is the stand the citizens of Winnipeg took. That is the stand the Minister of Labour took, and I leave it to the House whether or not he acted in the interests of this country in taking that stand as determinedly as he did. In that position the matter rests to-day.
We found as well that about 450 employees of the city post office about 180 of whom were letter-carriers and the rest postal -clerks, had joined in the sympathetic strike, and in violation, as we claimed and I think rightly, of their oaths of office, had deserted their posts, and as a result the postal service, a necessary public -service, was out of existence. What'-action should have been taken under those circumstances? Inasmuch as the strike on their part was on a sympathetic footing and nothing more; inasmuch as within only a few weeks before representatives of those men had, in writing, assured the Government of the satisfactory treatment of their grievances; inasmuch as they had gone out without notice and without cause, we decided that some time should be given to them to return and that with the approval of the Government on the expiration of that time their positions should be vacant if they failed to return and they should be no longer employed in the public service. As a result of the announcement of that decision which appeared in the issue of the Morning Press of Saturday, the 24th May, there returned on the morning of the 26th, I think, 70 of those employees. On the morning of the 26th May returning employees were harangued by the Eev. Mr. Ivens on the one hand and Mr. Winning, President of the Trades and Labour Council on the other, who standing respectively in the rear and in the front of the office tried to persuade the returning men that they should hold back; that the decision of the Government was nothing more than a hoax or a bluff, and with all the. force of their oratory-and it has some quality-they endeavoured to make the men hold fast against constituted authority and stand in full allegiance to the strike leaders instead of to the public of this country. Had it not been for that, I doubt not that more would have returned. The -business, however, of this Government was to see to it that all desiring should have free access to the office; that no physical impediment and no threats should deter them, and that duty was fully carried out on the part of the officers of the Government. No man was deterred, no man was intimidated; all had free and full privilege of' returning to work, and not doing so, the promise of the Government was implemented, and at twelve o'clock on the 26th May all who did not return, about 380 in number, lost their positions in the service of Canada and shall not be further employed.
Concurrently with the action of the Dominion Government in this regard, the Provincial Government took precisely similar action with regard to the telephone employees and their decision took effect also at exactly the same hour. The city of Winnipeg has since taken similar, although not wholly similar, action with regard to its employees. As a consequence, it is only the truth to say that the force of the general strike in the city of Winnipeg has been very largely broken; business has been restored, not to normal, but to something approaching normal level. At all events, the conditions of life are tolerable, but the-attitude of mind of the citizens remains still, in my belief, adamant that nothing

but defeat and complete defeat shall attend the efforts of men who dare to assert the authority of Government and who in doing so 'bring hardship on the whole community in order that they might win in a quarrel between certain employees and certain employers. The strike about that time and since has extended to some other cities in Canada, strikes not altogether related to that in Winnipeg, although in many cases related. Wherever in those strikes, the public service has been demoralized, the attitude taken by the Government and the policy adopted has been, the same as it was in .the city of Winnipeg. We have notified all concerned that if they engage in those strikes on a sympathetic basis-and there is no other-they thereby resign their posts in the public service and they are not further to be employed. That has taken effect in Calgary, and in the city of Winnipeg some 109 railway mail clerks went out on strike after I left, but all returned within the twenty-four hours' time given to them by the Minister of Labour for that purpose. They had not been warned in the same way as postal clerks in other cities, and that being the case, it was deemed fair that a reasonable time should be given to them, so they were allowed 24 hours, and all returned within the 24 hours.
We felt it necessary that the Government of the country should be well advised as to the exact facts connected with the extraordinary circumstances obtaining in that city. The telegraph was more or less denied; communication with the city was very limited; it was impossible at this distance to gauge not only what were the exact facts in dispute and the merits of the various classes that went out on strike, but the state of public opinion in that city in order to enable us to know whether or not we could supply voluntary effort to take the place of the strikers; whether or not public opinion was sufficiently aroused and seized of all the facts to back up the Government and enable it to carry out a policy of replacing those strikers , by voluntary workers for the time and by permanent substitutes at the expiration of a fixed period. Consequently, it was visited by members of the .Government and a survey was made of the whole situation. Men representing the strikers were taken into conference fully and at length. All they had to say, everything they had to urge, was heard sympathetically on the part of the representatives of the Government. For, let me say here: If there stands in Canada to-day a man who repre-
sents in fullest sympathy the cause of labour and labour organizations and labour unions, it is the Minister of Labour; a man who has undoubtedly the confidence of labour and labour organizations in this Dominion, and a man who, in my judgment, having had some opportunity to study closely the circumstances has to-day the confidence even of most of the strikers in the -city of Winnipeg.	'.
I have argued that the sympathetic strike cannot at all events become general, and in the main cannot take place, unless we concede the right to the violation of solemn contracts. I have argued further that the general strike cannot take place unless it is to be followed by an assumption of governmental power on the part of the leaders of the strike, who have no constituted responsible authority.
Let me carry that argument a little further, because what I want to impress upon the House is this: There is not in this dispute any question at all about the recognition of the right to labour unions; none whatsoever. No man can give a moment's thought to the circumstances and pretend to argue that the question of the recognition of labour unions is an issue in any degree at all; it is not an issue. The question as to the form of collective bargaining is in part an issue, and there may be merit on one side and merit on the other. In the opinion of the Minister of Labour there is demerit on the part oi both, and some merit on the part of each, hut no one can argue that the right to labour unions was involved in this strike, What shall be the form of collective bargaining was in the first place an issue. It was superseded after by a far greater, and a far graver issue that is now being fought out and decided; but for the time being it was an issue. What I want to impress upon the House is this: If collective bargaining is to be granted as a principle-and it is granted as a principle, as hon. gentlemen say, in other countries as well as in this-then there must be some unit to which the principle of collective bargaining is to apply, and beyond which it cannot go. It cannot for one moment be argued merely because collective bargaining is to be acknowledged that there shall be an unlimited and heterogeneous collection of all classes oi labour that may get together ad infinitum and then say to employers or to any class of employers ""You must bargain with us and cannot come to a decision unless with us."" If that is to take place then not only

the Metal Trades Council of the city oi Winnipeg, composed of crafts that are in no way concerned or employed by the employers in the dispute, can itself bargain as to conditions and wages with many of its members, even the majority of its members, have nothing at all to do therewith, but the Trades and Labour Council of the city of Winnipeg may also do the same, and you might extend 'it right on and on until you would have every organization of labour in the Dominion united and all exerting their united influence in every dispute that might occur. Can any one contemplate such an event? Can anyone contemplate that such an event could possible exist concurrently with responsible government by the people? Are we to have on the one hand a concentration of employers, and on the other hand a concentration of all the labour interests of the Dominion, fighting it out for supremacy? Collective bargaining, unless you bring it down to some unit, is bound to reach that end. If you are going to have a combination of all organizations of labour in the Dominion taking part in and determining the event of every dispute as to labour conditions and wages here, there, and at any other point, why then you have the perfection of Bolshevism. It would be nothing less. You would have an organization that could hold aloft the weapon of the strike or any other weapon- could hold that weapon aloft in majesty and dictate and read out to the rest of this country the conditions of life itself. Can any one find fault with the reasoning that leads to that conclusion? .
All I say in this:	Collective bargaining
is sound, but a unit must be found towards which the principle of collective bargaining is to apply and beyond which it must not go. Otherwise, you lead inevitably to a concentration of labour on the one hand, and of capital on the other, to a condition of dictation on the one hand and subordination on the other, whichever it may be, and to the complete elimination of governmental authority, because under those conditions it could not subsist. A general strike would then mean a paralysis of the activities of the entire Dominion, and indeed it might extend beyond the nation itself. Therefore, let me repeat, you must come to some unit, whatever it may be when you apply the principle of collective bargaining.
What should the Government have done that it has not done? I remarked early in my address that we had had nothing in the
193	.
way of constructive suggestion. It is true that the hon. member for Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe) prefaced his speech by the assertion, in language of which he is a master, that by our long career of errors and blunders and disasters this Government had brought about the terrible condition of affairs that he says now presents itself, but, no doubt out of affection for the Administration, he mercifully refrained from even mentioning any of these blunders or errors.

JACOBS (George Etienne Car.tier):,,J006 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe) this afternoon deplored the fact that when the Government decided to send delegates to Winnipeg to endeavour to settle the unfortunate disturbances which exist there now they should have selected the hon. Acting Minister of Justice (Mr. Meighen) )for that purpose. Those of us in the House who may have thought that the hon. member for Kamouraska was using language perhaps a little too harsh in regard to the hon. Acting Minister of Justice, will, I think, come to the conclusion, after having listened to the address with which he has just regaled the House, that he was quite right in his statement that it was a mistake of prime importance to send a gentleman with the cast of mind, and constituted with such a temperament as his, to endeavour to settle a strike of the magnitude we have on our hands now. One would have imagined, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. gentleman thought that he was in a court of justice and that he was pleading the case of the metal employers as against the employees. I do not know that I ever heard a finer piece of forensic special pleading in my life than that which we heard from the hon. Acting Minister of Justice to-night. Incidentally he told us

that his sympathies were with labour, that at some time in the future labour would probably achieve what it had set out to achieve; in other words, that "" man never is, but always to be blest.""
We have a situation confronting us in Winnipeg that concerns the whole Dominion, and yet the hon. gentleman talks to us about provincial and federal rights and the encroachment of one upon the other. That is, I consider, something quite beneath the hon. gentleman. When we have our house on fire we endeavour to extinguish the flames in the best way we can with the means at hand, and in our efforts we take the best means at hand. The attitude ot the hon. gentleman towards this question reminds me of the story of Mr. Squeers, of Dotheboy's Hall, in Nicholas Nickleby. He was such a kind man and his wife was such a kind woman that when the poor orphan child was dying they got out the best dictionary in the house and laid it under his head for a pillow. That is what the hon. gentleman is endeavouring to do now. He has treated us to fine words, he has given us a magnificent address; he has told us the position of the manufacturers, and he has told us that the strikers have .actually been so bold as to violate a contract. He says that in going on this sympathetic strike they violated a contract. I admit they violated a contract. The Allies went to war with Germany and contracts were violated as soon as war was declared. Does not the hon. gentleman know a strike is war, that war is negation of all law and that when you are at war you do not stop to consider contracts or who is right or who is wrong while the -war lasts? The discussion does not turn on the question of the contract or who is right and who is wrong, but you ask yourself the question: Why is it that the Government allowed this trouble to go so far without taking any action in the matter? We have sat here for the last four weeks talking on the legislation which has been presented by the Government. For the last four weeks we have had rumours of these strikes in the West, and particularly in Winnipeg. What has been done by the Government in the way of an attempt to see that this strike did not come about? Absolutely nothing. We have a Minister of Labour in Canada. Have any of us ever seen the Minister of Labour? We have certainly never seen ' him in this Chamber for the good and sufficient reason that he can not constitutionally enter this representative Chamber of the people. We have to seek for him in the rarer atmos-
phere of the Senate chamber. Last year we complained about the masterly inactivity of the then Minister of Labour; we charged him with being asleep when he should have been awake, but we never accused him of being awake when he should have been asleep. Now, they have changed the situation and given us a Minister of Labour who does not sit in this House. Last year we were chastised with whips, this year we are chastised with scorpions. For three weeks past questions have been asked almost daily of the Government as to what was being done about the strike, and their maid of all work, the hon. member for Halifax (Mr. A. K. Maclean), who speaks for the Minister of Labour, would get up, and in his bland manner, tell us that ""the Government has the situation
10 p.m. well in hand."" They have it well in hand? They have it well on their hands now and it is for them to get rid of it. Nothing was done towards seeing if some solution of the difficulty could not be found. The Department of Labour leaves these two interests to settle their differences amongst themselves. The place for the Minister of Labour during the last four weeks was in Winnipeg attempting to bring the parties together. He did nothing of the kind, and it was only when public feeling was worked up throughout the whole Dominion that he, accompanied by the Acting Minister of Justice, went to Winnipeg. What did they do when they arrived? We find by the press that the mayor of Winni-' peg, who naturally would know something about the conditions which prevailed there at the time, complained that for forty-eight hours after they arrived they never even called upon him officially or unofficially; that they never saw the mayor, in so far as I know, during the entire time they were there. The complaint was made publicly by the mayor that these gentlemen representing the Government, and particularly the Minister of Labour, never considered it worth while to go into immediate conference with the mayor and try to settle the strike.
The question of collective bargaining seems to be the difficulty between the two parties to the dispute, or it was at the beginning. As I understand it, when tne strike trouble first started, the employees of certain industries demanded the right to collectively discuss with the employers matters affecting every branch of trade of that particular industry. What difficulty was there about that which the minister could

not settle? There might have been some difficulty between the two contending parties, but it was the duty of the Minister of Labour to have located himself in the city of Winnipeg at that time and had 'he done so it would not have taken very long for him to have brought the parties together. He could ha-ve brought the parties together if he had been there but he was recreant in his duty. He never faced the situation and now the Government are trying to stand from under when they find me situation is such that .they cannot handle it..
In regard to collective bargaining, it is generally recognized in the United States, it is recognized in England and it is recognized in every country where they have discussed the matter up to the present time. But judging from the remarks of the Acting Minister of Justice one would imagine that if this were to be accorded to the strikers it would mean the overturning of our constitution and the rebellion of the people of the whole country. These people were perfectly right in their demand for collective bargaining because it is only by banding together that they can obtain rights in a way corresponding to that in which the manufacturers band together for their own purposes.
When this conflagration started in Winnipeg what were we doing in this House? We were discussing soothing syrup. You will remember that we went into a very long iand learned discussion upon the question of soothing syrup, not for the strikers ,in Winnipeg but for the infants under one year of age. The hon. member who speaks for the Minister of Labour waxed quite eloquent upon the deleterious ingredients of .soothing syrup. A day or two was devoted to this question in Committee and we finally sent it to a Select Committee for further consideration. Then we discussed the question oif titles. I am disposed to agree that the question of titles is one of importance and that it was right that it should have been discussed at that particular time.
The Eight Hon. the Prime Minister was away at the time, and it was necessary that we should get that Bill through before he returned, or the same thing would have happened here which happened last year. I do not begrudge the fact that we did spend a day and get this matter cleared out of the way before the Prime Minister arrived. ""When the cat is away, the mice will have their say."" I think the last time I saw the Prime Minister it was a day or two before he left for England last year,
and prior to his arrival on the other side we found that the net result of his having held up the question of titles was that his brother secured one, his private secretary secured one, and the apologist for titles in this House, the Minister of Trade and Commerce, also secured one. Perhaps if I had known titles were so easy to secure, I might myself have said a word or two in their behalf and been rewarded in the same way. I merely mention this to point out that it was necessary that titles should have been discussed before the Prime Minister's return this year.
Then we had the Sexual Offences Bill, the Fisheries Inspection Bill, and matters of that kind, and this important question, which should have been discussed three weeks ago, and ventilated in the House so that the country could know something about it, was stood aside until now, when it has got almost beyond our power. The Minister of Labour finally found his way to Winnipeg, where evidently several conferences were held with the strikers and with others. And what do you think happened afterwards, Mr. Speaker? An S.O.S. call was sent to Mr. Samuel Gompers, Just think of it. A call was sent to Mr. Samuel Gompers, advising him that the strikers had already defeated themselves, a congratulatory message, I fancy, but inasmuch as there was reason to think that possibly the intervention of Mr. Gompers might help to a certain extent, it would be advisable for him to take some action in the matter. Well, as I understand it, Mr. Gompers is not in any way connected with this movement, which started in Winnipeg, three or four weeks ago. It has got beyond the power of Mr. Gompers, and I cannot see why the Minister of Labour should have seen fit to call upon that gentleman unless it be that he wanted to return a compliment which had been paid to us some years ago when a serious strike was on in Colorado and Mr. John D. Rockefeller wired to Mr. Mackenzie King to come down and settle that strike, and inasmuch as the strike was satisfactorily settled I suppose the Minister of Labour considered it would be exceedingly courteous on his part if he were to invite Mr. Gompers to come to Canada for a similar purpose. As my hon. friend the member for Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe) stated, it was a most humiliating thing on the part of the Minister of Labour, implicating, as he did, the Government to invite an outside gentleman to take a hand in the settlement and discussion of this matter. Had it succeeded it might have amounted to some-

thing; nothing has heen heard of the summons, and, as far 'as I know, Mr. Gompers has not even answered the wire.
The Prime Minister is being given a great deal of credit, and rightly so, for tlhe work which he has done in the matter of the Peace Conference at Paris. He is a past-master in the art of peacemaking; that would seem to be his metier. We have it heralded in all the government organs of the country that as a peacemaker he stands pre-eminent. Might I suggest that while he has this divine afflatus about him he find his way out to Winnipeg and see whether he cannot use some of the methods which he has so successfully tried in Paris and bring about the settlement of this strike. We know he is-at least the newspapers have told us so-one of the most intimate friends of Mr. Lloyd George, and probably, having sat at the feet of that estimable gentleman, he must have learned something oi the art of peacemaking. Mr. Lloyd George undoubtedly knows something about peacemaking. Whenever a strike of any proportions whatever looms up on the horizon in England Mr. Lloyd George is on the spot and the strike is settled forthwith. Why is it, therefore, that having had the tutelage of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Prime Minister of Canada does not see his way to bring about a successful termination of the Winnipeg strike? He has the opportunity of his life now, and I hope he will take advantage of it as soon as possible. We have been getting along very well without the Prime Minister. I do not mean to say as well as if he were here:, but we have been pottering along fairly well for the last six months, and I think that the House would be quite willing to lend his services to the city of Winnipeg for a short time to see to it that this strike is brought to a conclusion.
In connection with this matter of collective bargaining, I would like to give the House an illustration of how it is working in the city of Montreal. Hon. gentlemen are aware that some time ago credits aggregating something like #is5,000,000 were granted to the kingdom of Rumania, and orders, were given for the manufacture of clothing and woollen goods to different merchants in Canada. Those merchants met here and parcelled out the orders among themselves. What did they do as soon as they got those orders? They at once sent for the President of the Garment Makers' Union of America, who controls all the garment
[Mr Jacobs.]
workers of this country, and they asked him to supply them with a certain number of garment workers in order to do this work. They asked for pressers, and stitchers and tailors, and so on, and made a bargain collectively with the Garment Workers of America in order to supply the necessary workmen to do this work. That is the way astute commercial men do their business. If that thing can be done in the case of Government contracts, and other Government work,, why cannot it be done in the case of the strike in the city of Winnipeg? I think, Mr. Speaker, it will generally be conceded by the House and the country that the Government has woefully fallen down in its endeavour to settle this strike; that it will have to admit its bankruptcy, so far as settling matters of this kind is concerned, and it will only be a very short time when the necessary petition to force them into the bankruptcy courts will be filed by the people of this country.

McKENZIE (Cape Breton North and Victoria):,Leader of the Official Opposition,J006 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, the question which has been brought to the notice of the House this afternoon by the hon. member for North Winnipeg (Mr. Blake) is one of the greatest possible importance. It has been very fully discussed from both sides of the House. So far I do not think it can be said that it has been approached as a party question by any person who has spoken. The hon. gentleman who has just taken his seat, the Acting Minister of Trade and Commerce (Mr. Maclean), who is speaking to-night for the Minister of Labour has made one of his usual plausible, well worded speeches but I do not think it can be said that he has given us anything definite, anything constructive or anything that will tend to alleviate the present situation the solution of which is dearest to the heart of every well-wisher of the Canadian people and of Canadian institutions. One would expect from the , representative of the Minister of Labour some constructive policy on this very important question. I take it, Sir, that the hon. Acting Minister of Justice (Mr. Meighen) who was at the scene of the trouble, having spoken and having given nothing in the way of a remedy for the difficulties with which we are confronted; that the hon. the representative of the Minister of Labour having also spoken, having gone very fully over the ground, and having sat down without saying anything that would encourage the hope that there is anything forthcoming from the Government to relieve the situation and to direct us along proper paths looking to the betterment of conditions, both of these gentlemen having spoken and other representatives of the Government, men of importance and standing with the Government and the country, having spoken and having said nothing to answer the substance of the motion;-we on this side of the House have the right to suppose that this is the last word in so far as the Government is concerned and that the Government has nothing at all to offer.
I may say that if I had any function more than that of a private member to

discharge in this House that function, under present conditions, would be brought, and should be brought, to the assistance of the Government if there was anything offered, or if they had anything to offer, to better the conditions with which we are now confronted. I am sure that whether or not we could take any party advantage from the situation, nothing would be further from my own thoughts or from the thoughts of any person who has spoken on this side of the House. I recognize, with hon. members who have spoken as representing the Government, that we must maintain Government in this country and that law and order and government must be respected. I recognize that this Government as constituted to-day represents the voice of the people, and that while they are the Government, and while they are occupying the seats of power that they do occupy, it is my duty, and the duty of every member of this House, to respect their position and to assist them when it comes to a crucial question such as this.
But the question is: Have they on this occasion, and on all occasions since they assumed power, done themselves justice; have they retained within themselves that power which they should have held, or have they been coquetting with and courting powers outside of the Government, powers which are supposed to be largely at the back of the Government? Have they coquetted and flirted with such bodies to such an extent that they have lost the confidence of other large bodies in this country? I fear that whether that is justified by the facts or not, we have large bodies of men in this country, representing the ordinary common people, if I might so speak, who believe-and it is just as bad to believe as if it were absolutely true-that this Government have no more will of their own, but that there are certain factions, combinations and powers which just carry them along, and that they do exactly as they are dictated to by these Higher powers. That, Sir, to a great extent, is what has caused unrest. It is believed the Government have forfeited their birthright for the mess of pottage that they have received from these parties. Whether that is true or not, it is just as bad as if it were true to say that it is true. It is the old saying-a saying that is perhaps not a classic-that you might as well hang a dog as give it a bad name. If you give a government a bad name whether it deserves it or not, its usefulness, to a great extent, is gone. From

the expressions of opinion which came to us from Winnipeg, Calgary and other cities in the West where strikes have been instituted, and from the men who are at the head of these unfortunate movements, it would appear that the Government had really lost that hold which the Government should have on the country.
There is nothing better understood than the responsibilities of Government in performing its own share of the contract. We tulic rbout the sacrednrss of eourructs and no person can have greater re-
11 p.m. speot for the responsibilities of men who are parties to contracts than myself. The Government has a contract. The people of this country agree that they shall support a certain party in power, support a certain Government, or support the King if you want to go that far. They give fealty and support to the King upon the definite understanding that the King and the Government in return will give protection and service to the country. Give proper laws and see that they are enforced. There is such a thing as kings and governments losing the right which they hold under the contract by not performing their functions and doing what they should do under the contract. It is being contended now that this Government is not so much alive to its responsibilities to the people as it should be.
I think I am bound to say-I think I must say, Sir-that toryism exists to-day as it existed a thousand years ago. Men die but principles never. The principles of toryism have been handed down from generation to generation. The good, honest men who sit on the treasury benches tonight are not responsible for the heritage of toryism which has been handed down to them; they are simply carrying forward a principle for the origin of which they have nothing to do. They are merely flies on the wheel carrying forward the principles of the party to which they belong.
Can anybody find anything in Toryism, from Adam down, but adversity to labour, adversity to the poor man, adversity to-democracy? And it is impossible to think that; we are going to get the coloured gentleman in the fence to change his sentiments-or the leopard his spots. It is the same-old thing. We had eighteen years of Toryism in this country. I would ask the most' genuine and orthodox Tory sitting in this-House what, during those eighteen long years, was done for labour, or for the labouring classes, by Toryism. We had a commission appointed in those days. Some-twelve years or so before the Tory Party;

went out of power in 1896 there was a commission appointed with Doctor MacLeod- I forget where he came from-at its head. He joined that commission as an active young man, but before anything was reported he died of old age, and nothing was [DOT]done. The Liberal Party came into power and found nothing but the ashes of this commission, with no possible result. That i,s all that was done by, or that stands to the credit of, the Tory Party for labour in this country during those eighteen jmaxs. Now these things may be disagreeable, they may sound harsh, but such in the case; and, as i said, those very principles have been handed down to this Government; and while it may have been retrograde in other matters, while it may have been inconsistent in other respects, it has been faithful to the law in carrying out Tory doctrine in dealing with labour, and it was determined to do nothing until such conditions as we have now presented themselves. It is no surprise to me, Sir, to find that the same old conditions are in vogue to-day that have been in vogue for the last fifty, sixty or hundred years, as far as the dealing of this party with questions of this kind are concerned.
It has been said that the labour people should have waited, that something was going to be done. I wish to point out that in the carrying out of what I said, the same principle, the same rule, the same tactics as in past years have been followed exactly since the present Government came into power. In 1917 I and others urged in this House upon the then Minister of Labour that something should be done to allay the conditions that then existed. After some trouble, and after some sarcastic speeches had been made against us, the so-called O'Gonnor Commission was appointed. Mr. O'Connor made a report which if acted upon might have been of some benefit and might have inspired the labouring people with some confidence. What occurred? The men who are said to own the Government rose in their might and declared, ""The O'Connor Report is absolutely false."" Mr. Henderson was then appointed a Court of Appeal to deal with Mr. 0'Connor. A year or so passed before we heard anything of Mr. Henderson and when we did hear from him nothing at all was done. Time passed, and even now we find that the Government is still in the dark and does not see a glimmer of light anywhere. We heard a great deal of my own "" light in the window,"" and there was a lot of fun made of it, but
it appeared that even "" the light in the window "" has not been seen by the Government from either the O'Connor or the Henderson Report, because, forsooth, they said, "" O'Connor was a mere lawyer and Henderson was a mere lawyer. Now we must get a judge of the Supreme Court to perform the operation of trying to penetrate our six-by-eight skulls and get some knowledge and light and leading into them."" A commission on which a judge of the Supreme Court sits is now travelling from coast to coast, trying to get information for the Government. It was not very long until the Government discovered that that was not enough, and the hon. gentleman who led the ministry in the absence of the Prime Minister thought at last he had struck on the remedy, the panacea, for all the ills, and he was going to appoint a Committee of this House. So that we now have a committee appointed to try and get information. We had the O'Connor Report and the Henderson Report; we are having Judge Mather's Report; and now we have the promise of a committee report, but nothing in the world has been done. Is it to be expected when the poor people whose bread is so high that they cannot get enough for their children, whose flour is beyond all reach, and everything else that comes upon the table of the poor man is getting entirely out of control, is it any wonder that they should give up all hope of this Government cloing anything and should try to take matters into their own hands? This is where the Government, it seems, cannot assert its rights. As I was pointing out a little while ago, it is the duty of the Government to exercise its vigilance and display its anxiety for the poor man and the people generally and when the Government fails to do that, then to some extent-although rebellion, or trouble, or violation of the law, is never justified- a man is justified when he takes matters into his own hands and tries to do the very best he can. That, Sir, is the situation that faces us to-day, not only in Winnipeg, but in every other part of this country. Absolutely hopeless of getting any immediate action from the Government people are trying to do the best they can to bring about better conditions for themsleves by their own actions.
We are told that nothing can be done toward the cutting down of prices. That was the old doctrine of the Tory Government some twenty-three years ago. Nevertheless, this Government has done something, not in foodstuffs very much, but the principle is the same. It started out, I be-

lieve, by cutting down the price of newsprint, and it has done something to cut down the price of coal and other commodities ; but as far as I know it has not done anything at all to make it easier for the poor man who has to go to his grocery store in the evening with his meagre earnings of the day to get enough to satisfy the necessities of the household wants. The Government has not done anything of that kind, and consequently we have the conditions which to-day prevail.
Now, Mr. Speaker, the chief thing is, what are we going to do? Is there nothing that can be suggested to better the existing conditions? Very shortly after the Prime Minister arrived home I took the responsibility of suggesting to him that the Government ought to have a conference of the leading men, both of labour and of capital, called to meet himself and his Government at Ottawa, and that some good results might follow the adoption of such a course. Nothing was done in that respect, and I suppose, possibly, there is not muoh good in talking about it now. However, I do not think it is too late, and the Government and the Prime Minister would get the credit of being in earnest if they would even now call upon the leading capitalists and the leading labour men to meet and see what can be brought about by a heart-to-heart talk in the presence of the Government ancf himself about matters of this kind. For the last number of years it has been in my mind, and I think I have expressed the opinion in this House more than once, that we should have in this country a court-not a commission but a court-of the highest possible class to deal with such conditions as we are now confronted with. It has been said that such courts have been a failure, but there is no use talking about it, we must have some definite, powerful, capable institution in this country to deal with matters of this kind. As far as I can see, Mr. Speaker, there is nothing to-day which this House or the Canadian people can deal with, the war being practically over, that is so pressingly important as the relations between capital and labour.
If we had a court of importance equal to that of the Supreme Court of Canada- or of more importance if you please- which would devote its attention absolutely to questions of this kind and give final judgments in them, I think that would be the only way in which such questions could be finally settled. I believe that the day 
will arrive when men of sound judgment will be surprised that we left the labouring people so long with no other remedy than the institution of the strike. Where can they go now for any remedy?

It is true that the honourable member from Kamouraska ended by a pitiful appeal to the Government to do something-something- he knew not what. The honourable member for (South Quebec (Mr. Power) also seemed to think we could in some way reduce the high cost of living by taking the bull by the horns. Outside of these two admirable suggestions, I am afraid the afternoon has passed without any recommendation being offered, except indeed a word of practical caution on the part of the mover and of the honourable member for Kingston (Mr. Nickle).
The Government of this country is peculiarly responsible for the administration of the public service to the best advantage of the people of this country. Is there any step we could have taken with relation to the public service that we did not take? It is argued on the part of some that there was a failure to implement promises made last summer to the post office employees. There was no failure at all. I had (Something to do with the settlement of that strike last summer. With all my limitations, and I know they are many, I ventured to act as a conciliator, and some way or other I had some success. Every promise I made was carried out to fulfilment. I said that if they should return to work I would recommend pay while out, that all should be accepted back, and that immediately the Civil Service Commission should sit upon the determination of their grievances, but that I could not recommend an increase by



way of bonus or otherwise without the authority ,of the Civil Service Commission. Not only were all these promises implemented, but under the special circumstances which were revealed here, a bonus was granted. Consequently, no fault can be brought home to the Administration that has the remotest relation to the strike on the part of the members of the public service that has taken place in the city of Winnipeg. Furthermore, whatever one might argue in that regard the strikers themselves by their action put any such argument by the board because they openly and frankly declared that they struck out of sympathy with the metal workers of that city, and in order, as they thought, to establish the principle of collective bargaining.
Now I am not here to argue as to what should be the change, if any, in the law with regard to strikes. That should first be considered collectively by the Administration, if any change indeed can be suggested. But I do wish to impress this upon the House: that the authority under our Federal constitution of the Dominion Government or of the Dominion Parliament with relation to the settlement of strikes is limited-very limited indeed.
Whether or not it is best that the precise division of responsibility that now constitutionally exists should have existed, or should continue to exist, I do not say. But the fact is that it does exist. It is fixed by the law and constitution of this country, and it is well that all should understand where that division is. The determination of civil rights in this Dominion is in the hands of provincial legislatures and those alone. The relations between employers and employed as to hours of labour, conditions of toil, and so forth, are relations of civil rights, and as such are beyond the jurisdiction of the Parliament of this Dominion. The habit has grown of following a plain assertion of truth of this kind by the comment that it is passing the buck to another; but the buck can never lie at the feet of those who are constitutionally incompetent to move it. Truth lies on one side or the other. Why should we not face it? I am making no complaint as to failure of any provincial authority to intervene or establish different relationships between employers and employed. That is another question altogether. On authority of the officers of the Crown, that power is not ours, and consequently we cannot exercise it, and should not be complained of for not indulging in the exercise of an aut'hor-
ity which we have no power to make effective. We could, it is true, by constituting the employment of labour, say, beyond a certain number of' hours per day, a criminal offense, assert and assume jurisdiction. But it is going pretty far to ask the Parliament of Canada, especially as respects employers and employees in private concerns, to say that a certain act on the part of these concerns is a crime, before any provincial legislature has decided that the prevention of it is a civil obligation. Laws regarding hours of labour in certain classes of workers have been passed by some, I think by all, provincial legislatures of the Dominion. Laws upon that subject generally, upon conditions of labour, child labour, women labour, hours of labour in general, have been passed by provincial legislatures almost times without number and are clearly within their jurisdiction and competency. Laws of that nature are not within our jurisdiction unless we choose to make a certain deed, which is not perhaps at all an offence against civil law, and which is not denied as a matter of civil right, a criminal offense. It would scarcely be suggested that we should take that course. Therefore, let it be clear that as respects a general law for the reduction of the hours of labour in this Dominion the problem, for the present at all events, is one for the provincial legislatures. Furthermore as to a general law setting up and enforcing the principle of collective bargaining, that itself is also a matter in regard to which the function of the Dominion Government can not be directory but com ciliatory and advisory alone. We could not by specific legislation declare and make it an obligation of an employer or set ot employers to adopt the principle of collective bargaining. All we can do in that regard is to say where we stand on the subject-where the Department of Labour stands and what is its advice and to press that advice by way of conciliation where-ever it can do good. Having done that, our powers are exhausted so far as these subjects are concerned.
Now, in a general study of the whole problem, while I think all hon. members will agree that the whole tendency has been and will be an addition to labour of its share in the product of industry, the part that any single country can play at any one time in the solution of that problem is very limited indeed. ,No single nation, no single industrial national unit, can advance appreciably beyond the general line of the industry of the

world. The industrial units of the single pation must compete in world trade with the industrial units of others, and handicaps cannot he put upon them which will unduly or disastrously militate against them in that competition. If such is done all will suffer-employers and employed. Subject to that consideration, it seems to me the duty of Parliament and of Governments, provincial and federal, is to see to it that labour conditions are ameliorated and that labour hours are reduced, because unquestionably with the multiplication and increased efficiency of machinery all the wants of mankind can be supplied without anything in the nature of oppressive toil. Unquestionably, by a much shorter day than has obtained in times gone by we can get along in this world and have all the legitimate wants of mankind supplied; and I say that it is the duty of legislatures and of Governments to make it possible, and indeed to make it imperative so far as lies in their and our constitutional powers, that the hours of labour be shortened and the conditions of labour be improved, so long as we do not go more rapidly than is consistent with the reasonable necessities of our industry in competition with the industry of other nations. That is the way in which I view the duty of the Parliament of Canada, and the duty of the provincial legislatures of this Dominion as a matter of general principle.
The problem is, indeed, a difficult one. These particular employers in Winnipeg have said already, "" We are quite ready to go down to nine hours and we believe we can do that and compete with our competitors in Ontario and other provinces, but we say we cannot go to eight hours until they do the same."" And they have said- at all events the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works have said clearly, that just as soon as their competitors in Eastern Canada went to eight hours they were prepared to do the same and to bind themselves in writing accordingly upon that proviso. That is an illustration of the condition and the difficulties that present themselves in one province as compared to another. Consequently it might have been well-I am not arguing whether it would or not; there are difficulties .the other way also-if the constitution had been framed so as to make this question a federal instead of a- provincial one. But it is not worth arguing. The fact is that it is not a federal question.
The tendency is, and I hope it may be more rapid in the future than it has been in the past, to a reduction in the hours of
1931	tP
toil, particularly on the part of the manual labourer, whose title to such reduction is sounder and more just than that of any other class of labour in the world. The tendency, I repeat, is to a reduction in the hours of labour and toward an increase in the remuneration of toil, both in the absolute and relatively, to other occupations. My only object has been to set out as clearly as I could what concrete facts present themselves in the face of the dispute that exists in the city of Winnipeg, and its reflection in many other cities in the-country, to submit that those concrete facts comprised the issue in the first place were overshadowed by a subsequent larger issue, and that such larger issue must be rightly decided before the officesof thisGovernmesrut, or, indeed, of the provincial government can be usefully exercised towards a settlement of the initial dispute. That view I believe the provincial government share.
I have also ventured to outline the general principle along which I think legislation should move in the treatment of the great struggle that has for ages long subsisted between capital anl labour and that can at best be ameliorated and not, at all events for many years, wholly removed or solved.

MACLEAN:,Minister Without Portfolio,J006 COMMONS,,,"Mr. Speaker, this afternoon the member for North Winnipeg (Mr. Blake) -moved the adjournment of the House in order that he might discuss the strikes in Winnipeg, and other Canadian cities, together with all the circumstances, conditions, and causes, near and remote, having any bearing upon them or any connection therewith. I thought it might be quite fitting that I should read the motion that the hon. gentleman made this afternoon so as to remind my hon. friend (Mr. Jacobs) who has just taken his seat that he has -entirely forgotten that motion, and has not directed any of his remarks to it. This is regrettable because the hon. gentleman is exceedingly able, -and I am sure that the House would have welcomed any remarks which he could offer upon the very interesting subject which has- been debated this afternoon-a subject which is not only interesting, but a serious one for the country. The hon. gentleman was disposed to criticise the Minister of Labour because he had not visited Winnipeg earlier. My hon. friend is apparently under the impression that the 'Minister of Labour had not intervened in this matter until his arrival in Winnipeg some time last week. I wish to assure him that this particular industrial strike in that city had had the personal attention of the Minister of Labour long before he visited Winnipeg, as all strikes throughout Canada from time to time have had his personal .attention.. '
My hon. friend (Mr. Jacobs) also expressed surprise that the Minister of Labour should place himself in telegraphic com-

munication with one of the greatest and most distinguished labour leaders of the world, Mr. Samuel Gompers. This criticism was not quite apt, because Mr. Gompers is much interested in this particular strike, many of the trades unions in the city of Winnipeg being affiliated with the international organization of which he is the head.
My hon. friend complains very bitterly and persistently that the Minister of Labour was unable to be present in this House, for reasons which he gave, and thereby was unable to inform hon. members as to the progress which was being made in the settlement of this particular strike, and as to industrial conditions generally throughout Canada. A statement appeared this morning in the press from the Minister of Labour, which was made public ju&t prior to his departure from Winnipeg for Ottawa, and I am disposed to ask the House to listen to me for a moment while I read two or three paragraphs of that statement. I think it proper that I should do so because the minister is not here to express his views himself, His statement is as follows:
The promoters of the general strike in Winnipeg now sit in the ashes of their folly. Something like 30,000 men and women were called out, professedly for the purpose of enforcing the recognition of the right of collective bargaining. In responding to the call, the majority violated and repudiated their obligations to their own trade union and their contract with their employers. Individually and collectively they wilfully discarded their agreements indicating that the possession of what they are Contending for is of little value.
Labor organizations which require that contracts made be fulfilled, merit and command the respect of employers, of the public and of governments. Labor leaders who advocate that only might is right, who hold that law, justice and honor should be discarded at will, merit and receive the condemnation of all good citizens.
If an employer or a number of employers in a given industry deny to their workmen the right to bargain collectively for the sale of their service, the entire force of the workmen may properly be directed against the offender and the public will approve and sympathize. In a general sympathetic strike the force is directed against the whole community who are innocent of any responsibility for the offence and public indignation Is immediately aroused because of the inconvenience, loss and suffering imposed upon innocent people. Therefore sympathetic strikes must always fail.
In March last at Calgary the play was written. ""The Winnipeg strike"". Was its first rehearsal with the main performance promised for a later date? The Winnipeg rehearsal has cost approximately two million dollars in wages lost in Western Canada and has proven the play to have been badly written and unpopular With both the public and most of the performers.
Employers must not mistake the outcome of the general sympathetic strike as a defeat to
organized labor, on the contrary, labor will emerge from the conflict strengthened with the wisdom gained from its experience. Numerous strong labor organizations have by their voice and actions largely contributed to the outcome because they believe the general sympathetic strike is wrong, vicious and demoralizing, Employers should rather seek to deal justly and at this period liberally, with their workmen and assist the bona fide labour unions in their legitimate efforts to obtain a reasonable wage for all who are willing to help.
That, Mr. Speaker, is the judgment of a man who is a friend of labour, and there is none greater in this country. I cannot for one moment make myself believe that there can ever be any serious difference of opinion in this country as to the adtion of the Minister of Labour in connection with the Winnipeg strike. Originally there may have been some merit- in the demands of the strikers, as the Minister of the Interior has already stated. That issue, however, soon passed away, and the issue became this: shall constituted authority prevail in this country, or shall a certain section of the community usurp it? That is fhe issue to-day, and it should end in only one way. It would be an unfortunate thing for this country if -the principle asserted by the strikers were to prevail, and I 'am surprized that their action has received the volume of commendation that it has in this House and outside.
Now, Mr. 'Speaker, in connection with the unrest which prevails throughout the world to-day, wfaat we are most interested in is to know, in the first place, what are its causes; and, -secondly, what can be done to abate it. Can any remedy be prescribed? There is to-day without doubt some political, social and industrial unrest in Canada. That is true of every other country in the world, and history shows that it is a characteristic condition following -all wars. I assume that every intelligent and reflective man anticipated political, social and industrial unrest following the war. And it is not at all wonderful, -Sir, that these conditions are found in this country, certainly no far-seeing man could expect this country to participate in one of the greatest wars in his-' tory for a period of four and a half years and at its end find stable conditions politically, industrially and socially. We shall have more of such unrest, and it is well that our people should recognize that fact. It would- be the part of folly to expect that we shall be entirely free of further industrial unrest. Other countries do not expect such to he the case. In the first place, the war 1s not over, and while the world cries for peace there cannot be peace until the treaty is signed, the armies are demobilized

and the economic processes which prevailed in. pre-war days restored. As an actual fact, the combat still goes on in Russia and in Hungary. Before 1914 the war now being waged in Russia alone would, I imagine, have been regarded as one of the greatest in history. Even if the war were over, we could not immediately grasp the results of - that terrible catastrophe. Unemployment will, I fear, prevail in many countries of the world for quite a time to come, and worse than that, famine will make its appearance in many countries. I* would imagine, although I do not presume to speak with accuracy, that up to the present time probably famine has reaped as great a harvest as have the contending armies. The most serious and solemn spectacle which presents itself to the world at the present moment is the fear of famine, decimating the peoples of many countries by the thousands and by the millions. So serious is the outlook that I cannot but take quite seriously the industrial situation in this and in other countries.
Our problems in Canada are largely manifested in the form of unemployment and industrial unrest. Is this a surprise? Should it not have been anticipated? Let me ask hon. gentlemen if it would be fair to expect that any Government or that organized society, could provide absolutely to meet this unemployment and this industrial unrest? The war built up large war industries; existing business expanded; the warring nations were contending for the immediate delivery of war materials and prices which would have been called insane in peace times were offered for wax material. This resulted in increased prices of materials and increased wages for workers; and wholesalers and retailers, demanding some of these increased wages, raised their price to the public. Positions sought men and not men positions. Then a sudden reversion to peace necessitated the disestablishment of all the industrial works that had been established during the war, and unemployment necessarily followed. Then men were looking for positions and not positions for men. This could not be avoided in Canada nor anywhere else. These conditions prevail in every country in the world to-day, and it should be a matter of pride for Canadians at this moment that our conditions in this respect are not at all comparable with the conditions which prevail in Great Britain, in all other European countries and even in the United States.

No Whitley scheme could meet the case fully and completely. Conditions of trade are always intimately associated with industrial problems. Trade is but the exchange of goods, and if opportunities to carry on an exchange of goods are prevented or minimized by any factors, whatever they may be, then trade is hampered, and there must be industrial unrest and some unemployment. We cannot anticipate, and nobody could rationally hope for, an immediate resumption of trade conditions as they prevailed in pre-war days. In the first place, as I have already stated, peace has not yet been signed; axmies have not yet been fully demobilized; capital is timid, and trade channels have been disrupted.
It will be many months, I fear, before a very large part of this world will be able to resume its economic processes. Until international trade is resumed, we shall have industrial problems. We may minimize them by the granting of credits to countries which wish to become purchasers of our products but which are unable to buy the same unless we furnish the credits. This has been done to some extent. The granting of credits has been -criticized, but nevertheless unless this had been done conditions in this country would have been far worse than they are at the present moment.
I refer to these conditions merely to emphasize this fact that employers and employees should recognize them. It should be conceded generally that we are confronted with conditions which we did not create and which are unavoidable, conditions which are difficult of solution, which are capable of a great deal of harm to this country and its citizens. The inevitable conclusion is that the duty devolves upon everybody, employer, employee and citizen, to contribute his part in the solution of a problem unprecedented in our history and one which unfortunately confronts almost -every nation in the worid. If we in Canada exhibit the spirit of patriotism and cooperation which our people exhibited during the long four and a half years of the war, we shall in the end overcome all these domestic, industrial and political difficulties which to-day confront us.
This war means a social reconstruction of this country, and, I imagine, of all countries. Representatives of all strata of society have fought, bled and died together in the same trenches to maintain a common purpose. I believe that this democratic spirit and this comradeship of the

trenches will not soon perish from the earth, and that is generally conceded by men in this and other countries. The conditions of those engaged in labour prior .to the war, especially in some countries, were not creditable to our civilization. That is not as true of Canada as of Great Britain and some other European countries. The war has clearly left the impression upon all thoughtful men that the amelioration of conditions of labour and improvement in the status of people engaged in labour must receive the early and sympathetic attention of all countries, and it is the duty, not merely of governments, but of members of parliament and of citizens to recognize this and to play their part in achieving this end.
The hon. member for Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe) this afternoon made many assertions which were, after all, pure assumptions on his part and which, as a matter of fact, are not correct.
For instance, he talked as if there was a tendency on the part of somebody to deny to labour the right of organization. That statement was unnecessary because it is quite incorrect and unfounded. Nobody in this country worth thinking about denies to labour the right of organization. It is a.piece of folly on the part of any industrial head to deny to his employees the right of organization. He should welcome it, and I am sure that in saying that I am reflecting the personal judgment and wishes of every member of the Government.
There is no disposition on the part of the Government to deny the statement that the hours of labour should be shortened. Personally, I should like to see an eight-hour day in this country, and I have felt that way for a good number of years. As a matter of fact the eight-hour day prevails very largely in Canada to-day. It is being adopted gradually, and I trust that it will become common even without legislative intervention. My hon. friend from Kamouraska seemed to argue that there was a tendency on the part of the Government, or Parliament, to oppose the eight-hour day, and he also argued as if there was a tendency on the part of the employers and the Government to oppose collective bargaining. In both these respects he is in error. I know of collective bargaining taking place in my native county many years ago. Collective bargaining may have different meanings in different places; one person may ascribe to it one meaning, and another person a different meaning. But collective bargaining has obtained in this country for
many, many years. I remember reading of it and hearing of it when I was quite a boy. We have instances every day of collective bargaining. We have it in four different ways: First, we have it expressed in the form of an agreement between an employer and a committee representing his employees, whether unionist or non-unionist. That form of bargaining has obtained for many years in Canada. Second, we have the agreement negotiated between an employer and a trades union acting on behalf of the members of such trade in his employ. The hon. member for Lethbridge (Mr. Buchanan) expressed this afternoon his approval of that form of collective bargaining. Third, we have the agreement negotiated between an employer and a union comprising all the different trades in his employ; we have that in Canada to-day. Then, lately there has been urged the new definition of collective bargaining in the form oi an agreement between an employer and a confederation of trades unions such as the building or the metal trades. Even before the Winnipeg strike we had an agreement of that kind negotiated in the city of Toronto in the building trades, on the principle of the Whitley scheme. That agreement did not succeed in averting a strike,, but at least there was one instance of collective bargaining in accordance with the Whitley Joint Industrial Council recommendations.
The honourable member for Kamouraska, spoke as if the Whitley scheme so-called was exactly the mode of collective bargaining suggested at Winnipeg. I say it is not. The Whitley plan involves collective bargaining, but it is more conformable to, the form of collective bargaining to which, we have been accustomed in Canada for many years past. I should like to read two or three extracts from the report of the Whitley Committee made to the Prime Minister of Great Britain. In the final report I find this:
Taking our first and second reports together they constitute a scheme designed to cover all the chief industries of the country and to equip, each of them with a representative joint body capable of dealing with matters affecting the welfare of the industry in which employers and employed are concerned, and of caring for the progressive improvement of the industry as an integral part of the national prosperity.
On the 31st of December, 1918, in accordance with the recommendations of the Whitley Committee many joint industrial councils had been established, in the following trades, for instance:

Bobbin and shuttle making; bread baking and flour confectionery ; building; china clay ; furniture; gold, silver, horological and' allied trade; heavy chemicals; hosiery; made-up leather goods; match manufacture; metallic bedsteads ; paint, colour and varnish ; pottery ; rubber manufacture; saw milling; silk ; vehicle building; wool textile and woollen and worsted.
Separate joint industrial councils were established in all these trades. The whole purpose of the Whitley scheme, as I understand it, is to set up a joint industrial council in which are represented the employers on the one hand, and the employees of some particular industry, and perhaps some closely allied industry, on the other. It is quite possible this scheme may have good results in Great Britain, and perhaps in other countries. I trust it will be successful wherever it is tried. Obviously, it is more capable of experimentation in Great Britain, on account of the size of the country and the ease with which the district councils may be organized. In Great Britain a few of the great trades might be organized in one industrial council covering the whole country.
I do not think I need say anything about the Winnipeg strike itself or the circumstances leading up to it, because that has been fully and ably covered by the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Meighen) who had personal acquaintance with the whole issues.
I should like to say a few words as to one of the causes which is assigned for high prices of foodstuffs, which in turn is assigned as one of the primary causes of industrial unrest in this country. High prices, being world-wide, cannot afford a complete answer for the conditions' which prevail in Canada to-day and which have been the subject of criticism in this debate. In almost every other country of the world prices are just as high as in Canada. Roughly speaking, you will find upon investigation that prices are exactly or very nearly one hundred per cent higher in 1919 than in 1914 in practically every country in the world. Our prices are lower on the average than they are in the United States or in Great Britain; and they are immensely lower than in many of the European countries. Now what is the cause of it? Mere criticism of the fact provides no help in the solution of the problem; and if it is capable of solution only by slow degrees and processes, it is better that we should realize the fact and frankly express that as our view of the matter; because if existing high prices are altogether attributable to governments, then we are disguising the real

issue. It has been stated by some hon. member, and it is not necessary that I should elaborate the point, that the chief reasons for the high prices prevailing in the world to-day are, first, an inflation of currency, and, secondly, a lack in the supply of commodities. These, I think, are fundamentally the two reasons for the present high prices. The same causes contributed to high prices following other wars; and students of the problem have given these two reasons as fundamental factors in the case. Now, if that be true, the situation can be met only in two ways: first, by greater production, and second by a deflation of our currency, and this latter can only be accomplished by a reduction of our war debt as rapidly as our country sees fit. If these be the primary causes, still I do not wish to be understood as saying that we cannot provide some palliative, something that might minimize these higher prices. At least it is the duty of the Government and of all who hold positions of responsibility to explore, so far as they can and as constantly as they can, any avenues which might provide any solution or partial solution of the problem. Somebody has suggested a fixation of prices. I am disposed to agree with the injunction tendered us this afternoon by the hor;. member for Kingston (Mr. Nickle) in this regard. It may be tried; possibly it should. As a matter of fact, the fixation of prices when tried in other countries during the war has not been entirely successful, and except as regards wheat and newsprint we did not directly attempt to fix prices in this country.
So far as foodstuffs and many other commodities were concerned, the Food Board attempted to control the profits of the wholesaler and retailer, and I believe this had some good effect; and I would venture it as my opinion that that would be a better method than the direct fixation of prices. There are many difficulties in connection with an attempt to fix prices in Canada. England tried it, and with some success. But their circumstances were very different from ours. In the first place, England is an importing country; what she produced in foodstuffs was quite negligible. Every industry and establishment in England was given over to the manufacture of war material, and she was obliged to import practically all her foodstuffs, at least. More than that, she was compelled to purchase these importations of foodstuffs for her people; and thus, being obliged to import, it was not a very difficult matter to control prices as she did. In

many cases the Government of Great Britain assumed part of the loss. This is particularly true as regards flour and bacon, and one or two other commodities. The portion of the cost of flour assumed by the Government of Great Britain amounted to about $5 a barrel. I do not know what it was in respect of other commodities. And in the case of New Zealand and Australia it was easier to attempt fixing prices than it would be in Canada. There, export was rendered almost impossible by lack of shipping, and it was possible, perhaps very much in the interest of producers in those dominions, to assume control of productions which could not be exported. But in Canada there are many difficulties. Some person suggested this afternoon that exportation should be prohibited or limited. I think that that would hardly be a hopeful experiment in this country unless it were carried on in a small way. This country must export foodstuffs particularly and raw material, otherwise we would be unable to carry on trade with other countries. Again, in a country of the magnitude of Canada, it would be impossible, in most cases I would say, to fix a price that would suit all sections of the country. Further, when prices are fixed they must be changed every week or every fortnight or month, and possibly every day, and this would cause endless irritation to consumers and producers. I submit, therefore, that on the whole itwill be found a most difficult method of dealing with the matter of prices. During the whole period of the war, as I have already stated, the Food Board attempted to curtail the profits of the wholesaler and retailer. The Cost of Living Commission, which was a bureau of the Labour Department, throughout the war co-operated with the Food Board and other war organizations in the way of obtaining information as to production cost, and selling cost, and in this way was in a position to afford a great deal of publicity which was of considerable use. However, in connection with the high prices prevailing in this country, which I admit are regrettable and impose very great hardships upon *our people, we must realize that we are in no worse position than the people of other countries. And while this is not much of consolation to those who must submit to burdensome prices to-day, yet it does indicate that the condition is one which is not local but has a world-wide application and is one of the incidents of the war, due to an inflation of money and a lack of supply to
meet the demand, and which we can overcome only gradually and by a resumption of the efforts enjoined in the slogans so popular and acceptable to the people during the war, namely, more production and more thrift. Only in this way can we escape altogether from the conditions now prevailing in respect to prices which undoubtedly account very largely, or at least to some extent, for the present high prices.

SINCLAIR:,,PURCHASING OF DEPARTMENTAL AND OTHER SUPPLIES.,,,"The practice has become prevalent of dispensing with public advertisement in many cases. A department professes to know the number of people who deal in certain articles in some province or vicinity, and instead of calling for tenders by public advertisement they send a circular letter or notice to the dealers. If this can be done in a fair way the practice is satisfactory. But the difficulty is that certain names are omitted from the list in the department and complaints are frequently made, as they were in the case of the War Purchasing Commission, that certain people did not get these notices. It should be easy to provide that in cases of this kind merchants or dealers could send in their names and post office addresses and be entitled to the usual notice.

Of course, it cannot make tenders come in; all it can do is to require that tenders shall be presented, and it proceeds on the basis of accepting the lowest tender. There may have been some cases where the commission called for further tenders or endeavoured to get lower prices by reason of the first tender being excessive. I am sure that any member who looks into the work of the commission will be satisfied that it has rendered a very conspicuous piece of public service ever since it was inaugurated.

BURNHAM (West Peterborough) :,,PURCHASING OF DEPARTMENTAL AND OTHER SUPPLIES.,,,"I should like to draw the attention of the minister to a little incident which will serve as an illustration of something that has happened very frequently, and may happen much more frequently, very much to the detriment of the member for a constituency. Under the old system it used to be known that tenders for coal were required. Now this Bill does not apply to the wthole system of tendering. Consequently, there is just as much room for inefficiency and for doing evil that there was before. There is no way under Heaven by which business can be properly done if you cannot rely on the honesty of the people doing it. Let me give an instance. Instructions were sent to a janitor to find out how much coal was required, and what the price, would be. He did so, but instead of asking several people what their tenders would be, he asked only one man, and he sent that man's tender to Ottawa. It was accepted, and then the people rose up on their hind * legs and said "" What sort of a member of Parliament are you to allow such work
as this to go on?"" I said "" I, did not do it."" "" Oh, yes, they said, that won't go here. You are the member for this constituency and must watch the Government in everything. You must look into this matter."" So having ascertained the facts, I communicated with the Minister of Public Works, and in due time he communicated with the officer he had employed at Peterborough, one of his own officers, and found I had stated the matter correctly. I said to the Minister of Public Works "" What are you going to do about it? This man is perfectly honest. I do not think he intended to do anything wrong, but the efficiency of your system is now on trial. What are you going to do?"" He replied "" I will have to fine him five dollars."" So the Minister of Public Works fined his own agent in Peterborough for inefficiency in a transaction under this brand-new system which the member had nothing to do with, but which he will' have to watch very carefully.

I have been reading the Bill and I cannot understand the necessity for three commissioners to purchase the supplies for the departments of this Government. I will guarantee to supply them with a man who, if he is furnished with a good, clever stenographer and one or two inspectors, will purchase all the supplies that the Government will require in a year and who, even then will not be any busier than the purchaser for any large institution in this country. Referring to clause 5, I find that the Governor in Council may appoint an officer to be called the director of the Purchasing Commission for Canada. What is he going to do? Is he going to direct the commission how to purchase? As I understand it, the deputy minister, or some other head of a department, may put in a request for supplies and the commission will purchase them. I suppose this director will direct them how to purchase the supplies.

I do not know what else it can mean. I believe that under the present system there is a waste in purchasing for the Government departments, This will mean not merely three commissioners; a whole department will be built up with forty or fifty clerks, stenographers and so on. It will run into a department and a very expensive one. We want to economize. That is what we were told to do yesterday, and by the looks of the financial statement, it is necessary not only as a people but as a Government. I see no economy in this Bill as introduced. I am sorry I did not hear the minister's explanation for it. There may be a reason for it. I understand there is a great deal of waste in the purchasing of supplies by the different departments. This new department will require, I suppose, a lot of typewriters. There are.plenty of typewriters in the different departments that are not in use, but this new department will not have any old typewriters; they will insist on having new typewriters, new furniture, new stationery, almost everything new, and they will not under any possibility gather up equipment that might have been used by commissions and departments that have been abolished. There is no necessity for waste in purchasing if it is properly conducted. Why we want three commissioners to do the purchasing when one man could easily do it, is more than I can comprehend; besides which there is to be another man who is to be called the Director of the Commission. I see no sense in the Bill at all.

to the House the considerations set forth in the report of the War Purchasing Commission, to which report I have already alluded. The disadvantages of the methods which have prevailed in the past were presented to us in this way:
The need for centralization is clearly demonstrated 'by the numerous disadvantages of the present arrangements under which each department makes its own purchases, subject to approval of the War Purchasing' Commission. Some of these disadvantages may be stated as follows:
(a)	Each department is now buying supplies in utter ignorance of what the others are doing.
(b)	The departments generally do not get the benefit of the technical knowledge and experience acquired in each department.
(c)	The quantity of goods required by some of the departments is not sufficient to enable them to purchase at the best prices.
< d) When high prices prevail, owing to shortage of material, this condition is aggravated by competition amongst the Government departments themselves.
(e)	There is a lack of uniformity of specifications and also of inspection.
(f)	Large volume of emergency orders resulting in higher costs and giving opportunity for irregularities and * complaints arising therefrom.
(g)	There is a deplorable lack in the departments of study of market conditions, revisions of specifications, et cetera.
The report continues:
That co-ordination in Government buying would do much to remove or lessen the disadvantages of the present methods is beyond question. Enquiry shows that while each department may require certain supplies which are peculiar to its special needs, yet the larger proportion of the total outlay is for goods common to several departments. If the requirements in a particular line, instead of being ordered separately by each department, were bought collectively by a central purchasing office with its stall of experts for each class of goods, the larger quantities ordered, the elimination of competition among the departments, the decrease in emergency purchases, the adoption of uniform specifications and methods of inspection, and the many other improvements which would be possible would result in an enormous saving of money, and still further remove any temptations to personal favouritism which may now exist or tend to creep in in the future.
Some reference was made this afternoon to the possibility of delay through waiting for the action of a Central Purchasing Commission in respect- of small supplies required by departments of the Government in different- parts of the country. That subject has been under consideration. It was dealt with by a provision in the Order in Council, and as to emergency purchases of that character-small purchases urgently required and as to which it would be quite undesirable to go to the expense of advertising for tenders-there is no reason why these

I would anticipate that when the commission is fully organized the great majority of those in the different purchasing staffs of the various departments will be transferred to the commission.

Advertisements given by the Government to the press constitute a purchase of space. Will this express ""right to purchase "" include that purchase? Some days ago, whilst discussing the Post Office Department, I suggested to my hon. friend that the Government should put an end to the policy of wide advertising in such cases as mail contracts, and I gave some concrete instances.

year that a weekly paper published in the county of Drummond and Arthabaska had notices of tenders for mail contracts to be awarded in the province of British Columbia. This is a pure waste of money, and the commission should have power to direct the purchase of space in the press. If the minister will assure me that this expression, "" right to purchase,"" covers the purchase of space in the newspapers for advertising purposes I have nothing more to say.

If we had time to go through all the ramifications of all the departments we would find that a whole lot of things had been purchased in supplies of various kinds that would not measure up to the standard. I think that if this proposal were submitted to any group of business men who are accustomed to purchasing any considerable quantity of goods they would say it is the only possible system by which efficiency can be attained. To have purchases distributed broadcast, and to have experts in engineering-for instance, in the Public Works Department-start out to buy dry goods, boots and shoes, or woollen goods, about which they know nothing, is the height of absurdity and could not possibly be carried on in any private business, because a private business is done on a basis that would not permit the waste necessarily involved in such a system.

from any other branch of the public service so far as relates to the desirability of purchasing supplies at the best possible price and on a purely business basis. But the opinion of the War Purchasing Commission, who were requested by the Gov-

ernment to look into and report upon this matter, was that the national railways constituted such a distinct and important branch of the public service and had such an efficient purchasing organization in operation that no public interest would be served by taking it over. The Order in Council of February, 1918, authorized the War Purchasing Commission to make an investigation and report on the matter, and that was the report they made.
I was referring to the purchase of supplies. Last year there was purchased uu-der the direction of the War Purchasing Commission, apart from certain supplies which I shall mention presently, $48,718,537 worth of supplies. In addition, contracts were made for the supply of provisions and other commodities for the military camps and other public services, the contracts being made on a certain basis as to price for the supplies required for two, three or four months as the case might be. The commission has no record of the amounts supplied to the various branches of the public service under these contracts, but the total would be several million dollars. The commission during the past year has handled on the average about 100 distinct transactions a day, or a total of about 30,000 for the year. This gives some idea of the volume of business which has come before the commission and which has beer presonally supervised by the members of the commission.

Something has been said about the absence of ministerial responsibility. The commission cannot purchase a dollar's worth of supplies unless they are requisitioned by a minister, and the minister must requisition the precise article he wants. It is not open to the discretion of the commission to buy anything they want. If a two dollar or a fifty dollar basket is required the requisition must definitely call *for it, and if a steel cabinet or a wooden cabinet is required it must be requisitioned for. The very best prices will be obtained and the best business judgment exercised in the purchasing of goods, and this question does not affect the duties of the Auditor General one iota. He will perform his work as faithfully and as fearlessly as ever.

One would suppose that ""included in the Estimates"" would mean the regular Estimates where provision is made for furnishing the necessary moneys but the use of the word ""requisitions"" takes away that meaning.
Mr. [ROWELL: I would draw my hon. friend's attention to two sections which deal with requisitions and supplies respectively. He will see that section 12 provides for a written requisition. That contemplates a specific requisition for the actual supplies that may be required at any time. But the Government holds the opinion, upon the advice of the existing commission, that purchases may be made with great advantage if supplies, say for three months or for six months, are purchased instead of small supplies such as a department might requisition for a month or two, and also that it might be a great advantage to have the . supplies of certain given commodities for all the departments made at the same time. Therefore, section 13 requires that all of the departments shall send in an estimate of the supplies they will probably require for such period or periods of time as the regulation may prescribe. The regulations may require each.department to give an estimate of 'the supplies it will require for six months, or whatever period of time may be determined as being best from the point of securing the goods at the lowest price. If a department puts in an estimate then the commission may purchase on the basis of that estimate, or, if it puts in a specific requisition, the commission may purchase on the basis of that requisition. That is the reason -why these two words are used in this clause.

I want to say that Sir Hormisdas Laporte will not be on the new commission; he will not accept a position on it. His duties will not permit him to do so. But if there is one thing more than another he has urged upon the attention of the Government, it is that we should make this commission permanent. He speaks out of the knowledge and experience gained during the past four years, from what he knows of the purchasing methods in all the departments of the Government, from what he knows of the purchasing by large business houses like the one with which he is himself connected. It is not a matter of speculation with him. He knows that it will save the public millions of dollars to have this commission established. If there is one thing that he wishes to see before he retires from office after four years of service, without receiving a dollar of remuneration for the splendid work which he has performed, it is the perpetuation of this commission for the benefit of the people of 'Canada.
What is true of Sir Hormisdas Laporte is equally true of every other member of the commission. In one of the last conversations I had with the late Mr. Gundy, one of the ablest business men from my own province, who had served his country without any compensation and who would not have accepted a position oh the permanent commission because he was compelled to return, as he thought, to resume his business duties in Toronto, he said: "" In my judgment the Government would 
be doing a great thing in the interest of efficiency in the management of public affairs and in the saving of public money by making this commission permanent."" He urged the value of the work of this commission and the great importance in the public interest of making it permanent. As a business man he considered the establishment of this permanent commission as one of the most important achievements of any Government. What is true of Sir Hormisdas Laporte and Mr. Gundy is equally true of Mr. Galt. He joined in the recommendation whidh the Prime Minister read to the House this afternoon urging the Government to continue the commission.
My hon. friend from Maisonneuve said that there was no better business man in Quebec than Sir Hormisdas Laporte. Why should one of the foremost business men of Quebec, Sir Hormisdas Laporte, why should one of the foremost business men of Ontario, Mr. Gundy, why should one of the foremost business men of Manitoba, Mr. Galt, after years of investigation and experience in this wofik, unite in making such a recommendation to the Prime Minister if it was not that, as business men, they believed it was in the public interest to do so and that it would mean the saving of millions of dollars to Canada? Otherwise they [DOT]would never have thought of making such a recommendation. The adoption of this method of purchasing supplies during the war meant that we abolished party patronage in the purchase of millions of dollars' worth of supplies. Does any member of the House, now that the war is over, want to see a revival of that old system of patronage in the purchasing of supplies? The hon. member forMaisonneuve said that if patronage had not been abolished there must be on this side of the House some members of the society of Ananias. Party patronage was abolished in the purchase of supplies by the appointment of the War Purchasing Commission. Bring this commission to an end and in the purchase of supplies for all the departments of the Government party patronage will be restored. This Bill is to continue the work of this commission so that party patronage shall be abolished in the purchase of all supplies.
Let me read to the House what the Prime Minister said upon this subject at the opening of the last Parliament:
In addition, we have given our attention to
abolishing patronage absolutely in respect of

all purchases. Hon. gentlemen who were members of this House in the last Parliament will reoollect that in the spring of 1915 the War Purchasing Commission was established for the purpose of contnoling the purchase of all articles required by the Government for the purposes of war. It has done good work and given excellent service; the gentlemen who compose it have given their services freely and voluntarily as a patriotic duty. We have passed an Order in Council that not only war purchases but purchases of all articles, commodities or materials required by the Government shall be made through the War Purchasing Commission and hy tender and contract.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier:	Who are the members
of this commission?
Sir Robert Borden:	Hon. H. Laporte, of
Montreal, chairman; Mr. Gault, of Winnipeg, and Mr. Gundy, of Toronto. On the retirement of Sir Edward Kemp from the 'board when he went overseas, Mr. Eaporte was appointed chairman, and Mr. Gundy became the third member of the board.
That statement by the Prime Minister, made at the opening of the session a year ago, was to implement the pledge made by the Prime Minister when the Union Government went to the country in the general election in the fall <jf 1917.
I had the privilege of speaking with the Prime Minister in the province of Ontario at a number of meetings. I do not know what he said elsewhere, but I know what he said in Ontario, and according to my best recollection there was not a meeting at which he spoke where he did not point out to the electors that the policy of the Government was to abolish party patronage, not only by appointments to the public service by extending the scope of the Civil [DOT]Service Commission, but. also in the purchase of all war supplies by enlarging the powers of the War Purchasing Commission, and to make the work permanent. On every platform on which I heard the Prime Minister speak he .made that pledge to the country, and I know with what enthusiasm it was received by the people. I want to say to my hon. friends on both sides of the House, much as some of them might and db prefer the old system of party patronage in which political influence undoubtedly affects purchases in the departments of the Government, that I have been sufficiently in touch with the political life of the country for the past twenty years to know that prior to the establishment of the War Purchasing Commission political influence played a large part in the purchase of supplies in connection with the Government. The people of this country are heartily sick of that kind of thing, and they responded most cordially to the Prime Minister's announcement of policy in this matter.

I do that more sincerely because I regret to add that his speech did not succeed in removing some distrust which 1 have of this legislation. Indeed, some of the facts to which he referred rather increased than allayed that distrust. He made some references and gave us copious figures regarding certain purchases which we made in war time that would have been a good justification of this legislation in war time, but I understand that the object of the Bill is to perpetuate in times of peace the machinery which was found necessary during the war.
In my opinion, one of the most fundamental principles which the Government need to observe, if they are going to be a successful Government now, is to make as rapid a transition in their thought from war time to peace time as is consistent with the situation. There are a good many things we had to do in war time which I think we shall be glad to discontinue, and be compelled to discontinue, in times of peace.
My hon. friend for Brant referred to the great success this commission had had in purchasing salmon, but I do not apprehend that the Government of Canada are going to be perpetually in the fish-dealing 'business. They had to purchase the salmon,

I presume, to feed the men at the front, and the same remarks apply to a great many of the other figures which my hon. friend gave. That was all right for a Government in war time, but I have, I repeat, very grave distrust of continuing that system in time of peace. The creation of this commission seems to be the shifting of governmental responsibility. We have been a country in Canada for some time now, and the various departments of the Government have had their experts making purchases for their departments., Their duties would be to study the needs of their own particular department, and if they were connected with the department and studied its needs it would appear to me on the surface, at any rate, that they would be better qualified for purchasing ifor that department than a commission would which had surveillance of all the departments of the Government. Furthermore, I think the creation of this commission will be associated with an increase in expense. I do not know what the minister's view would be on that point, but if he would assure me that it would lessen the expense he would remove one of my objections, and no doubt score a point in favour of this legislation.

His belief-because it is only a matter of faith with him; he has told me he believes it would reduce the expense- partakes of the nature of a prophecy, and as I have said before, the only thing you can do with a prophet is to disbelieve him, especially when he prophesies something that is contrary to one's own experience. I have very grave doubts that it would not increase the expense. It certainly increases the machinery of government, and if my hon. friend can increase the machinery of government and reduce the expense he will certainly be something of a miracle worker, because our universal experience is that with an increase in the machinery there inevitably follows an increase in the

expense of government. These are the reasons why -1 do not accept the belief of my hon. friend on the subject. I have very grave doubts about this being a departure for the better, and I shall be glad if	those doubts	can be removed.
It is no pleasure for me to oppose any legislation introduced by the ministry, and I would be very glad if the doubts that I entertain could be removed. But they exist jn my mind and I would not be doing my duty if I did not express them.

chasing agent or agents. I do not see how any one having any business experience can disagree. Any ordinary business man, or small firm that is purchasing goods up to $100,000, without going into the millions, will find it to their advantage to pay a salary to a man who understands how to purchase, who knows where to get the right kind of goods, as has been pointed out by the hon. member for Brandon (Mr. Whid-den), and who knows what the goods are when he sees them. How does any large corporation, such as a departmental store, for example, do its purchasing?

I ask hon. members to recall public criticism in the press and in Parliament, by the Opposition, in reference to the purchase of supplies, while the Liberal Government was in power, and, when the Conservative Government was in power, by the Liberal Opposition. Prior to the appointment of this War Purchasing Commission, in the press and throughout the country there was public criticism of middlemen who stepped in and got a rake-off and commissions. Who has heard that criticism in the past two or three years? It has ceased to exist. The business men of Canada have absolute confidence in the impartiality and fair dealing which the War Purchasing Commission has given them. They are satisfied that they have been given a square deal and that there is no discrimination, and for these reasons I submit that it is greatly in the public interest that the commission should be continued.
My hon. friend from Red Deer (Mr. Clark) inquired with regard to expenditures. He was not able to accept my estimate for the time being without some proof. In the different departments of the Government there are at present probably no fewer than three hundred officials engaged in connection with the purchasing,- inspection and acceptance of supplies for the Government, and the opinion of the War Purchasing Commission is that by consolidating all the work under one single purchasing commission there will be a substantial saving from the mere standpoint of the number of officials employed to do the work. There will be a saving by reason of the greater efficiency in purchasing.



If only one per cent is saved in handling business to the extent of $40,000,000 per year, it would represent an economy of $400,000 per year.

There are one or two other points I desire to make clear. The ministers must requisition for the supplies they need. Parliament must vote the money for every dollar that is spent; not a dollar of expenditure is taken away from ^Parliament. The War Purchasing Commission does what the Central Purchasing Branch of the Canadian Pacific railway does. It purchases, inspects and accepts goods, but the department must requisition for them and pay for them. The department must be responsible for the purchases, and for these reasons I submit that the Bill is greatly in the national interests and is the fulfilment of the. pledge made by the Prime Minister when the Union Government went to the country in the year 1917.

He has been trying to argue himself into the belief that he did not put his party in an entirely false position when he opposed this Bill. He has introduced many other subjects into the discussion of this clause; I shall not follow him in them all. As to the Civil Service, that can be discussed when we reach the Bill dealing with that matter. I shall not follow him on the Military Service Act; it is not germane to the present discussion, but I may say at least that the statement he made, is, of course, quite without foundation. But coming to the subject under discussion, I say to my hon. friend that there is no political patronage in connection with the purchases made by this commission. If he thinks there is, he has the opportunity of endeavouring to establish that belief before the Public Accounts Committee. If the name of any man producing any particular line of goods is furnished to this commission, the commission will ask him to notify them of all the goods that he handles, and he will have exactly the same opportunity to tender as every other person has. The commission has endeavoured to secure the best list that could be secured of men engaged in various lines of industry and dealing in various kinds of commodities, in order that they may receive notification of the supplies which the Government wishes to purchase, and in order that they may put in a tender if they wish to do so.
I am quite sure my hon. friend has not taken to heart what the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) said with reference to the chairman of the commission, Sir Hormisdas Laporte, or Mr. Gundy, or Mr. Galt. Those men have not lent themselves to political party patronage, but they have carried on the business in an honesit, straightforward way. This commission is-doing .so and will continue to do so, notwithstanding the remarks of my hon. friend.

I venture to think that if hon. gentlemen opposite were free from party entanglements and obligations, this Bill would never go through the House. Some of the very best men sitting behind the minister have spoken against the Bill, saying that the commission was not necessary and that it involved a further expense when every dollar should be carefully conserved.
We have at present a committee of members of this House inquiring as to where we can cut down the Civil Service. They say that everything is overlapping; thait we have ten to every one that we require in the Civil Service. Those are the statements that are made. I do not know whether they are true or not. We have also a commission to which we have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to find out where we could weed out and cut down the Civil Service. In the midst of all this the minister comes here to create a new department in which at the first flash he is to put 300 men for whom he is creating a home. He admits there is no work for them, because

he says this commission is _ being created for the purpose of cutting down work. Then he is appointing a director over them, and there is no telling how many are to be added to this new department of the Civil Service. Yet I am to be told by the President of the Council that I am afraid of my own action and the action of the Opposition in this House because we are opposed to the creation of a new department and the further involving of the people of this country in the unnecessary expenditure of millions of dollars year after year. If that is all that I have any reason to be afraid of, or if that is the only mistake I have made in my position as leader, I have very little to fear from the judgment of the people.

I quite understand that cases might arise where it would be obviously the duty of the commission to take the state of the market into consideration. For instance, I remember that when the new Parliament buildings were on the point of being commenced the parliamentary committee appointed to
supervise their erection decided to buy the steel framework of the building in advance because it was hinted to one of the members that the price of steel would go up by several points, as it did. Of course, there was a saving by that purchase. But that was a very extraordinary case that occurred during war time. In normal times the commission, I think-indeed, I am positive of it-should not go beyond the amount provided by Parliament for each of the departments. I think my hon. friend ought to make that clear in the Bill.

I delayed giving any definite statement on the subject until I had had opportunity of conferring with the Minister of Labour (Mr. Robertson.). Immediately on his return from Winnipeg I took the matter up with him and he informed me, as I have already stated in the House, that during the past winter and spring he has had many conferences both with employers and employed, and it was because of the suggestion received by him from the employers on the one hand, and from the employed on the other, that he suggested the appointment by Government of the Industrial Commission which is now engaged in investigating these questions in different parts of Canada. Suggestions both as to the scope of the commission and as to its personnel were presented to him by the employers and by the employed. He took all those suggestions into consideration, and I think he gave to both employers and employed the representation which they themselves had proposed. That commission will report, I hope, in a few days. It is understood that immediately on their return on the 15th of June they will make a brief report, to be followed at an early date by a fuller report. The Minister of Labour has the view, which I share, that pending the reception of that report and the information which it will afford, it would be unwise to call the general conference proposed.
There is much, however, which commends itself to my judgment in the suggestion for a general conference, and I can assure my hon. friend that immediately the work of that commission has been completed, and the results of their labours cornmunicated to the Government, most attentive consideration, and I am inclined to think favourable consideration will be given to the suggestion contained in the telegram my hon. friend has just read.

I do not purpose to make a speech, but I purpose to offer one or two observations. I am informed not only by merchants who have had dealings with the War Purchasing Commission, but also by purchasing agents of uie different departments, that the operation of this War Purchasing Commission has not been a success.
For example, I am informed that they ask for tenders for certain commodities, returnable on a certain day, but that they do not order the goods until three or four months afterwards. That is to say, no time is stated within which the goods must be delivered if the tender is accepted. The result is that it is impossible for intending tenderers to give the better price, because they do not know the date of delivery, and for that reason the War Purchasing Commission has been paying much larger prices for goods than would be paid if the

purchasing was done upon a more businesslike basis. In fact, I am told that the business of the War Purchasing Commission has been managed by one or two clerks, and that business men who have dealings with them find the commission very unsatisfactory as to prices, date of delivery, and general quantities required. On the other hand, I am informed by purchasing agents of the departments-perhaps more or less in confidence-that they were able to purchase more advantageously for the Government when they purchased solely for their own departments; that they got better delivery and better prices, and that the goods were superior. I am also informed that local purchasing is practically cut out; that the War Purchasing Commission have been buying largely in the United States and that they refuse to recognize local agents for the supplying of goods manufactured in the United States. The result is that a large number of mercantile agents have been unable to do business with this commission. I bring these matters to the attention of the House because 3D think that before we embark upon a scheme which means a large expenditure of public money in the payment of large salaries to members of this commission and its staff, we should investigate the matter more carefully and see whether the system is any improvement over the one that was in vogue prior to the creation of the War Purchasing Commission.

You will agree that this is one of the most important subjects from the business standpoint that has been brought before the House this session. I think we should concern ourselves more about the soundness of the principles which underlie this Bill than about the question whether some of the details in connection with the manner in which we have been purchasing recently are an improvement on the methods of the pa*t.
We are departing, by this Bill, from the procedure that has been adopted by the War Purchasing Commission, in that a new organization is being set up. We are combining in one department the experts and others who have been looking after the purchasing in the different departments, in order that these specialists may devote their attention and abilities to work which will benefit all departments. Let me illustrate.

During the fiscal year ended March 31,'1919, provisions were purchased in fifteen departments, dry goods in sixteen, hardware in eighteen, mechanical goods in eighteen, drugs, chemicals and scientific articles in sixteen. This Bill proposes that men shall be engaged as specialists in these different branches of purchasing. One man, for instance, will be an expert on groceries and provisions. It will be his duty to
4 p.m. study the markets, to know the goods, to find out when it will be most favourable for those who are able to tender to supply the goods to the Government. He will select articles as standards that are most generally used, in order to permit a larger number to submit tenders fbr the supplying of those goods.
Another thing we should consider is that the goods themselves must be carefully inspected; tests and analyses of certain articles will be necessary. This commission can better employ these experts and get much better general results in that respect. I know of an instance where a manufacturer was asked to tender for a certain article. He tendered at a wholesale price to the War Purchasing Department, but they purchased the goods from a jobber at a higher price. Now, the Purchasing Department were led to believe that the goods they were purchasing represented better value than those which the manufacturer in question offered to supply; but it turned out that the goods were the same as those bid on by the manufacturer. I do not blame the War Purchasing Commission for that, but under the new system that difficulty would be overcome.

whole debate, and I have very grave doubts as to the advisability of the House passing this measure. Of course, I do not pretend to discuss the relative merits of the gentlemen who were, and, indeed, still are, the members of the War Purchasing Commission. I do not know these gentlemen except Sir Hormisdas Laporte, who is one of the most distinguished citizens of my province and enjoys the very highest reputation both as a business man and as a faithful administrator. But that is not the point at issue. I believe in the old saying, which, indeed, is more than a saying because it is found in the Holy Book, that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. I believe that every man exercising a responsible function coming within the bounds of the constitution should be amenable to Parliament; but I shall discuss that point a little later on. For the present I simply wish to say this: The war is over. It is true that yesterday the Minister of Finance said that as regards the necessities and 
requirements of 'the financial year this should properly be called a war year. I do not deny that at all, but the war is at an end, and the extraordinary proceedings bordering on unconstitutionality which took place during the war and which were criticised and challenged by His Majesty's loyal Opposition should now be discarded. The Canadian people have submitted themselves during those fouir eventful years to what I would call autocratic rule. Although a Liberal, and inclined to be - radical, I admit that the peculiar conditions existing not only in Canada but throughout the whole civilized world justified to a certain extent some of the measures which were not enacted, but imposed upon the good-will of the people of Canada. We have been governed by Orders in Council. Parliament has disregarded some of its most sacred and ancient privileges. We have witnessed in this House members of the Government receiving the emoluments of office during nearly one year without having even received a mandate from the people. I protested at the time against such a violation of the British constitution, British precedent and the ancient and time-honoured usages of our own Canadian constitution. The people resented the autocratic methods which the Government thought proper to adopt for the time being, and I warn the Government that the people of Canada to-day are not in a mood to stand for any such breaks in the future. During the war, of course, the Government had a practically free hand in spending the millions which were taken from the public exchequer for the business of the Canadian army and the Government generally. Indeed, it has come to this, that during the last four years the Government has enjoyed the fullest privileges as regards the expenditure of public money. We had yesterday from the hon. the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) a statement which is now before the whole Canadian people. I may be regarded as cheeseparing, but I say that with the financial condition of Canada today as it is the duty of the Government is to put. the brake on the expenditure of public money. On this score alone I say to the Government "" halt."" The amount involved may not be over $50,000 or $60,000, or perhaps $100,000, but I say in all gravity, with a full sense of my responsibility and not for the mere pleasure of digging the Government in the ribs, but as a Canadian, and having regard to the financial standing of Canada, that the Government ought to exercise, the closest control over every dollar of expenditure.

My hon. friend the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowell) is a member of a practically new government. The Government which took office in 1911 and the Union Government by which it was superseded, have created so many commissions since that time that, although an old member of the House, I would be at a loss to give a list of those commissions without speaking by the book. I think it is not going beyond the mark to say that at least forty or fifty commissions have been created since 1911. Each commission was created for the purpose of relieving the members of the Government from some of the work for which, with all due respect, the members of the Government are paid in hard cash by the people-the tax-payers-of Canada.
The financial condition of this country is most alarming. I need not repeat the figures quoted yesterday by the Finance Minister. There must be a beginning in the reduction of public expenditure. We must revert to the old Alexander Mackenzie method of practising economy. Only last evening we heard a minister of the Crown, at the head of one of the most important and responsible departments of the Government, namely the Department of Railways and Canals, admitting that in connection with the Trent Valley canal, and the deepening of the Welland canal, the expenditure was practically useless, but, as he said, we must give employment to the returned soldiers of those districts. When he was put to the test, and asked by my hon. friend from Antigonish and Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair), and by my hon. friend the leader of the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie), how many returned soldiers were employed on the Trent Valley canal, and on the deepening of the Welland cdnal, he said there were about 200 employed, although the money to be expended will reach a total of over $4,000,000 in both instances.
There is grave unrest in the country and the people will not stand very long for the wild expenditures that are being made on the most flimsy pretexts. Now, let us come to this new commission. Is it necessary? I have the greatest respect for the opinion of my right hon. friend the leader of the Government (Sir Robert Borden), but, with his experience as a parliamentarian and a minister of the Crown, is it necessary that the War Purchasing Commission which has ended its business, honourably, creditably-I frankly admit-should be continued in operation? Is it necessary that we should now embalm in the statute books legislation which makes of a temporary
commission created for a special purpose, namely, war purchases, a permanent one?
With all due respect to the Prime Minister of Canada, I say it is not going beyond the mark to say the contrary. It is not necessary to make that commission permanent. Having ended its business- the purchase of supplies during the war- it is unnecessary, now, that we are reverting to the old lines of business, to add this new burden on the shoulders of the taxpayers. I do not know exactly what this new commission will cost the Treasury, but I believe I am not far astray when I say that it will entail an expenditure of nearly $100,000 at least. I am told that an army of secretaries, typists and bookkeepers were employed during the war, and possibly during that eventful period it was proper to have that organization. The purchases were enormous in size and the amounts involved were very large, and it was proper, I repeat, that during that period a special commission should have been created in order to protect the public treasury. But, now that the war is over, the commission has ended its business. I feed confident that it has handled this business creditably and honourably, and speaking from what I know, I state most positively that a man of Sir Hormis-das Laporte's standing in the community would not give the commission anything but the best advice, and the people of the country anything but the best service. We are. however, reverting to pre-war conditions as regards the administration of each department of the Government. I was a member of government for eight years, during five of which I was directlyresponsible,with my colleagues of the Laurier Administration, to Parliament. I know that a minister of the Crown who is simply honest and is endowed with some business ability can manage his department by taking, of course, the necessary safeguards and by exercising the necessary checks upon the expenditure which comes under his eyes every day. I had one of the large spending departments to administer, namely, the Post Office Department. I know that the expenditure of such a department can be honestly supervised with the best results. A requisition is sent to the proper officer from whom it must come before the deputy minister, who is the first officer of the department, and from the deputy minister it goes before the minister. Every requisition must pass through several channels, and a minister of the Crown, if he is honest and knows his business, will be sur-

rounded by good' officials whom he will trust. Have not we reformed our Civil Service? Have not we increased the salaries ol the deputy ministers and given them, so to speak, a more extended authority to protect the public exchequer against the raids that might be made from outside? And, Mr. Speaker, have not we abolished the patronage system? If we have, not abolished it, then, Sir, some of the hon. gentlemen opposite belong to the tribe of Ananias, because we have been repeatedly informed in this House, day in and day out, that patronage had been abolished in every department of government. If patronage no longer prevails, if the system of public tender is followed in each department, what need is there to create this new commission, and for what purpose have - e this year increased the salaries of deputy ministers? Their salaries were increased first from $4,000 to $5,000, and now from $5,000 to $6,000 a year. Are they going to be deprived of all authority? What is their business if not to administer their departments and to see that expenditures are honestly made and procedure honestly carried out? I say that there are checks and safeguards at every step in each department if the deputy does his duty and if the minister in charge will simply live up to the statute defining his powers in his own department. My hon. friend, the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowell) belongs, as I do, to the legal fraternity, and I believe that he has a keen business intellect. Will he tell me that in his own department, and sticking to his business-of course, if he is lost in Imperialistic dreams, that is another matter-he could not keep a vigilant' scrutiny on ""expenditures? Now that the war is over and peace is going to be signed, let us come to essentials, let us get down to elementals-in popular language, let us get down to brass tacks. We are no longer at war. The Peace Treaty will be signed in a short while and we shall resume the even tenor of our way, constitutionally speaking. Canada is Canada. There is no revolution from a constitutional point of view. There is some unrest in the country, but it is against the Government, and the profiteers, not against the constitution. We are resuming our duties as in pre-war times, and I would urge my hon. friend to come down from the high heaven of his dreams to solid earth. Let him tackle the business of his department. Although /I do not share his views politically, I know he has enough business acumen to direct the affairs committed to his charge in conformity with the statute. What is the use
[Mr. I.emieux. 1
of that Bill? Has my, hon. friend read the statutory powers of each department? If he has, he will find that in each department there are checks and safeguards; and above all there is in the Government of Canada an officer who is the watch dog of the treasury and who officially is known as the Auditor General of Canada.
Do you beiieve, Mr. Speaker, for one moment that old Lome Macdougall, that John Fraser, that the present Auditor Genera]- whom I have not the pleasure of knowing, but who is an honest and sturdy officer of the Crown-might have been or would be in need of a commission to curtail expenditure, to see that the law as regards public tenders was followed? What are the duties of the Auditor General if not to call the attention of every minister of the Crown, when he has overstepped the mark, to the fact that he has not confined himself within the powers conferred upon him by the laws of Canada? When I was in the Government, Mr. Speaker, my nightmare was the Auditor General. I was afraid every year-

' ently overlooks the fact that we already have in the several departments approximately 300 employees engaged in this work. The task of purchasing the various classes of supplies required by all the departments is an enormous one. After those supplies are purchased, they must be inspected. The officials must see that all the supplies purchased are in accordance with [DOT]specification; that they are up to standard in quality and quantity. Then they must [DOT]accept. The officials are responsible for those three things, purchasing, inspecting and accepting, and that is a very large undertaking when not less than $40,000,000 worth of goods of all kinds are being purchased in all sections of the country. I do not think we would be justified in cutting down the number further than we have. This leaves it open to the Government to review the whole situation and decide what is most advantageous.
Mr. PETER McGIBBiON:	I can quite
understand the hon. minister's object if he is going to make these commissioners inspect everything and be an authority on everything. They will have to have proper inspectors, no doubt, to see that the quality and the standard of these goods are right. I cannot conceive of three commissioners being so qualified on everything that they can pass judgment after having inspected every line of goods this Government is going to buy. That work they will have to delegate to proper inspectors. Taking that into consideration, I do not see why it is necessary to have three commissioners.

These newspapers were selected to suit the minister, and it was simply perpetuating the old patronage system. The officer produced a number of newspapers containing a certain advertisement and they all happened to be of one stripe of politics. We asked if this was not a patronage list, and this officer denied that it was. He said: ""We have no patronage lists."" ""What do you call it then?"" he was asked. He said ""I call it a selection."" That was his new name for it, but it was the same old thing we used to call a patronage list.

happen. The Commission and all its employees may pass away but the Civil Service Act of last year provided that appointments to commissions of a temporary character must be made by the Civil Service Commission. Some of the war commissions, in selecting their staffs, paid higher salaries than were given the members of the staffs of the several departments of Government. The result was an obvious discrimination between those regularly in the service and those who were taken on by these commissions. It naturally caused a great deal of dissatisfaction on the part of those in the Civil Service and a great deal of embarrassment and annoyance to the permanent departments of the Government because the persons employed by these commissions were being paid on a different basis from the others entirely. They had the very same trouble in the United States during the war only they had it in a more aggravated form than we had. It was for that reason that the Civil Service Commission was

given jurisdiction over appointments to the staffs of these commissions.

says may be quite true as a matter of law, but he will see that the old commission does not go out of existence until the new one is created. The object is to continue the work which has hitherto been carried on by the other commission. The other commission, carrying it on during the past four years, has inevitably secured a number of employees who have developed a high degree of efficiency and skill in this work and in supervising the work of all the departments of Government. They have a general knowledge of all the departments which the employees in any one department, no matter how efficient they may be, have not. While these men have no claim to be transferred, yet in the public interest, having regard to the necessity of carrying on the work efficiently, the Government deems it desirable that there should be some provision whereby those possessing this ability can be transferred. That is the object of subsection 2. It does not follow that all will be transferred; it only follows that those whom the new commission may desire, and the Civil 'Service Commission recommend, will be transferred in order that the work of the new commission may be as efficient as possible.

bound to dispense with their services. Why make an exception of this particular service and make the employees permanent when hundreds are being turned off in other places? They should all be treated alike and be called upon to make a new application. If they pass there can be no complaint, but you are going to transfer every one in this War Purchasing Commission to a new permanent department. After you have done that, you will find in the Militia Department, say, about twenty or thirty or forty men out of employment because their work is finished. Will they be transferred to some other department without an examination? They came in without an examination and now that their work is finished they are to be turned off. If the principle that the minister is establishing here is to be applied, these men will argue that as 'permanent places have been found in this new department for fifty or a hundred men, or whatever may be the number, it is unfair to turn them on the street. What sort of fair play is there in that? If the policy , were adopted that every one who comes into the new department should enter ab initio under the Civil Service Commission no fault could be found as there would be no favouritism or preference.

On the other hand, it is suggested that we are not giving them power enough. This is the view underlying the Bill. The department must take the responsibility for the quantity and the general character of the goods it desires to have purchased. The minister of the department is responsible to Parliament. He must requisition the supply, and must finally pay the account; he must ask Parliament to vote the money. As the law now stands, he can go out and buy the supplies, but. when this commission is appointed he will have to make a requisition to the commission. If the commission had the power to change the requisition of. their own motion the minister might come to Parliament and say, "" I have no responsibility."" We do not think it is desirable that he should have that escape or that the commission should exercise that power. If the commission is satisfied that the requisition is not wise they report direct to the minister to whom they are responsible. They lay the facts before the

Prime Minister, that a certain department is asking for too much or for something that is not in the public interest. It appears to me that this provision maintains ministerial responsibility and ensures the best results in the purchase of supplies.

do not intend to delay the House long by any remarks of mine, and in that way I shall gain the approval of the minister who has just taken his seat (Mr. Burrell). I always listen to him with attention when he speaks, and generally when he replies to remarks from this side of the House his words are a complaint as to the length of the speeches made by us. I wish very frankly and courteously to tell the minister and the House that we on this side intend to take just as long on any subject matter of interest to the country as we think proper, subject, always, to the gag which the majority can place upon us if they desire to do so.
The minister has stated that the argument of the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) was not a businesslike argument. He says that the proposal to appoint this commission is a businesslike suggestion, and that whatthisBill proposes to do, namely, to put the purchasing of all Government requirements into the hands of what practically amounts to an irresponsible commission, is something which all large businesses do by centralizing their purchasing activities. I grant that it is of advantage to have the purchasing centralized, but I say that in order to do that, it is not necessary for Parliament to abdicate its power and its responsibility. Suppose the Canadian Pacific directorate appointed a small purchasing committee. Suppose that small committee spent lavishly the money belonging to the Railway Company. Suppose that at an annual meeting a shareholder said to the Chairman of the Canadian Pacific ""You are spending too much on this, that or the other thing."" What would the minister think if the Chairman of the Canadian Pacific said: ""We have appointed a committee which is only removable in a very difficult fashion every ten years. Therefore, do not blame the directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway for this extravagance, because it is the fault of the committee which you and I appointed at the last meeting."" Does the minister think that that answer would satisfy the shareholders of the Canadian Pacific? It would not satisfy them for a moment. There is no man in this House

who desires to see patronage eliminated more than I do. Patronage has. been the curse of politics in this and other countries. It is what induced some people to call politics ""une sale cuisine,"" or a dirty business. But it is not necessary, I respectfully submit, to appoint a commission of this sort to get over the difficulty. There are purchasing agents in every department, and one way to get over the difficulty would be for these purchasing representatives of every department to have an association whereby they would communicate the necessities of their several departments to one another and see that one was never bidding against the other in buying supplies, or if it is necessary to go still further -and my experience of public matters is not sufficient to enable me to state whether it is or not-a purchasing department might be formed composed of well-paid and intelligent civil servants, and presided over by the minister, who will be responsible to this House for what that purchasing department does.
"" TheTninistex-said- thatministeriah^-espem-sibility would not be affected. I am sure the minister is frank and fair in his mind, and I put this proposal to him: Let us suppose that he wished to have a waste paper basket for his office as Secretary of State, and he requisitioned one. This commission, with large ideas, and believing that ministers from the West desire expensive waste paper baskets, went out and bought, we will suppose, a mahogany waste paper basket for about $40, as was done for- one of the ministers from Saskatchewan the other day. Now the minister says, "" I would be responsible for that purchase."" He would not be responsible. He would be responsible for asking for a waste paper basket, and responsible that a waste paper basket was bought, but he would not be responsible for the price paid for that basket, because if he was attacked for buying a trifling waste paper basket for $40 he would hold up his hands and say: ""I come from a country where such extravagance is regarded as disgusting, and the responsibility for buying that $40 waste paper basket rests on the shoulders of the independent commission appointed by this House. If you feel that this waste paper basket matter is of sufficient importance, then if a joint petition of the House and the Senate is carried in both Chambers we can remove the commissioners from office."" No, the responsibility of asking for the goods will be on the minister, I frankly grant, but the responsibility for the price paid for the goods will be upon the commission and not upon the minister.
What does this mean? This Bill is just a reflection of what governments have been doing in this and other countries. Administrations have got rather tired of ordinary members of Parliament; they are in the way, and things cannot be done as quickly as they could be done if ministers could only have their own sweet will. In Great Britain commissions have been formed ad libitum. They have been created in large numbers in this country, and one of the duties that falls upon the representatives of the people in this and other countries is to see that the House of Parliament resumes its functions, that it shall no longer be a rubber stamp for what the ministers desire to do.
In one sense that is not the great question. In another sense it goes to the very root of the matter. Are the ministers desirous of avoiding responsibility? In the days gone by heirs to thrones and princes must not have their teachers' hands laid upon them. They had "" whipping boys "", and if the young prince did not know his lessons the-""-""whipping boy-^-got-tho flogging.-If ministers do wrong when purchases are made, if improper prices are paid for the supplies which are bought, what will the ministers say? They will say: ""Turn to the whipping boy, turn to the commission; it is not our fault.""

The situation so far as the postal employees are concerned, whether at Winnipeg or elsewhere, is very simple. In. Winnipeg they went out on a sympathetic strike although they had no grievance of their own and they were given a period of between two and three days within which to return to their duty. They were distinctly and emphatically informed that if they did not [Sir Robert Rorden.j
return to their duty by Monday noon, the 26th of May, they must regard themselves as permanently retired from the public service. I understand that a very considerable number of them were disposed to return, and seventy of them did return. The others were deterred, I understand, by the assertion made to them by interested people that the Government was ""bluffing"" and would not dare to carry out its proposal in regard to the men who had thus deserted their duty in the public service. A very distinct intimation was sent by telegram to Calgary, to Edmonton, and to every other western city in which strikes had not then taken place, but where there seemed a possibility that the employees in the public service would go out on a sympathetic strike. That telegram has already been communicated to the House, and will be found at page 2957 of the unrevised Hansard of the 27th of May, 1919. *L need not read it again.	*
It was a distinct and emphatic intimation to the postal employees that if they undertook to go out on a sympathetic strike, disregard their public duty, accept the direction of another authority than the Government, dislocate the public service of this country, and occasion widespread public inconvenience, they must regard themselves as permanently retired from the public service of this country.
I have had a great many communications on the subject since, and I have sent replies. I do not think it is worth while reading them to the House, but I am perfectly prepared to do so at any time if my hon. friend so desires. I can only say that the Government, having taken this position, and taken it, I think, with good cause, would render no good service to the public interest by withdrawing from it. There was the most plain and positive intimation to all these employees as to the result of the course which they proposed to take, and having given that warning I do not think they are at liberty to blame the Government of this country. They have no one to blame but themselves and those who induced them to engage in this sympathetic strike. I greatly regret that they find themselves in their present position.

out local buying but simply provides that purchases shall be made by this commission. The question of where purchases should be made is a matter with which the commission deals. Provision is made in the Bill, as is necessary, that certain supplies may be purchased by the departments in small quantities or in case of emergency, which might arise in any section of the country. Just as in every well organized business where there is a central purchasing department, there must be a certain amount of latitude given to officials on the ground in the making of small or (emergency purchases, so provision is made ffor such purchases in this Bill. The Bill provides for the appointment of three commissioners to hold office for a period of ten years, and they shall cease to hold office on reaching the age of 70 years. A3 I have already intimated, the salaries are left blank, and that clause must stand
iMr. Rowell.]
until the resolution is submitted to the committee authorizing this expenditure. The main clause of the Bill defining the powers of the commission is section 6, which reads:
(1) The commission shall have the exclusive power and right to purchase, contract for, inspect and accept supplies for the public service. Provided, however, that the commission, when it deems it advisable, may, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulation or by the commission, authorize any portion of the public service to purchase, contract for, inspect or accept supplies.
Members will see that the commission can make no purchase except upon requisition of the various departments. Under section 12 the departments must present requisitions showing the kind and quantity of supplies they require. The commission have no authority to change any such requisition, but if they feel that the requisition is not one which they should comply with or that for any other reason the attention of the Government should be drawn to it, they may communicate to the Prime Minister their observations on that requisition for such action as the Government may see fit to take in the premises.
Section 13, it will be seen, provides that estimates of the supplies required shall he made on or before such dates as may be prescribed by regulation and sent to the, commission. This will enable the commission to purchase at one time for several departments and in large quantities.
Section 16 requires that the purchases shall be by tender.
Section 17 provides that the commission shall keep full records and make such reports to the Prime Minister as he shall from time to time require.
In brief outline I have set forth the main provisions of the Bill, and I can only close as I opened: The object of the Bill is to secure the benefit of the purchase on a business basis, through one central organization, of all supplies required by the Government for public purposes, wholly free from party patronage or political influence, so that the Government will receive for every dollar expended a dollar's worth in return. Every citizen of Canada is interested in securing this result, and this Bill marks a great step in advance over the pre-war and early-war conditions.

Bill is to continue the work which has been carried on during the greater part of the war period by the War Purchasing Commission. The intention of the Government is to make sure that in future the purchase of all supplies required by the various departments of the Government shall be made through a purchasing commission of business men with tenders called for from the business men of the country and wholly apart from personal or political influences. The members will recall that in May, 1915, an Order in Council was passed creating what was known as the War Purchasing Commission. The Order in Council provides that:
All purchases of clothing, equipment, arms, juns, ammunition, horses, munitions and materials of war and supplies of every kind, and all contracts for such purposes, and all contracts for transportation, payable out of the funds appropriated by the War Appropriation Act, 1915, or out of the funds appropriated by any other Act for the purpose enumerated in the War Appropriation Act, 1915, shall be made by the commission or made under its direction and control, and the commission is hereby empowered on behalf of the Government to make such purchases and to enter into or direct and control the making of such contracts.
Under that Order in Council Sir Edward Kemp, Mr., afterwards Sir, Hormisdas La-porte, and Mr. George Frederick Galt, of Winnipeg, were appointed members of this commission. The commission carried on its work of purchasing all war supplies and all supplies purchased out of the War Appropriation Fund, until the autumn of 1917, without any change in personnel. Sir Edward Kemp, upon being appointed Overseas Minister of Militia, resigned the chairmanship of the War Purchasing Commission and also resigned his membership in it. Sir Hormisdas Laporte was appointed chairman, and

Mr. W. P. Gundy, of Toronto, succeeded Sit Edward Kemp on the commission. The commission as reconstituted conducted its work under this original Order in Council without substantial change until the spring of 1918. In the month of February, 1918, the powers of the commission were enlarged so as to cover the purchasing in all departments of the Government, with the single exception of that of Government railways. An Order in 'Council was passed on the 6th February, 1918. The recital gives the reasons not only for the Order in 'Council, but also for the present legislation, so that I may be permitted to read one or two clauses from it:
And whereas the Prime Minister is of the opinion that the provisions of the above mentioned Orders in Council and the functions of the War Purchasing Commission might with advantage be extended to all purchases by the several departments of the Government for any purpose, whether connected with the prosecution of the war or otherwise, subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth:
And whereas the Prime Minister observes that the establishment of the War Purchasing Commission has resulted in a very great saving of public moneys, 'as well as in the abolition of patronage in respect of purchases for the war and it is important to extend this system as widely as possible, pending consideration of permanent provision for that purpose after fuller study and consideration of the problems involved.
Under the original Order in Council it was provided that purchases should be made by or under the direction and control of the commission. In carrying on the work the commission have acted under the latter part of this clause, viz.: the purchases have been made under the direction and control of the commission, with the results outlined by the Prime Minister in the recital to the Order in Council of February, 1918.
This commission was appointed for the period of the war and the members served in an honorary capacity. They have all given their services to the country without any compensation whatever, and I am sure the, members of the House will feel that the House owes an expression of appreciation to those public-spirited business men for the faithful and efficient service they have given to the country in this important branch of the public service. It is a matter of great regret to the Government, as I am sure it will be to the House, that one oi the members of the commission, Mr. Gundy, of Toronto, died very unexpectedly some ten days ago, while in the service of the country, and the commission has lost the benefit of his valuable services. He was deeply interested in the work of the com-

mission, and gave unstintedly of his splendid business ability in its service. So great was his devotion to his country and to his country's cause in the war, that 1 am sure if he had had the opportunity to choose the circumstances under which he would pass away, he would have chosen to die in the service of the country he loved and while working in the cause which lay so near to his heart.
The Bill provides for the creation of a Central Purchasing Commission under which in future the purchase of all supplies for the Government will be made. As I have pointed out, under the existing Orders in Council purchases were 'made under the direction and control of the commission and each department continued its existing purchasing staff. The commission did not consider it desirable to disturb the existing staffs, as the War Purchasing Commission was of a temporary character, and when it was formed they thought that probably when the war was over pre-war conditions would again prevail. But now that it has been decided to make the War Purchasing Commission a permanent organization, there is no longer any reason for maintaining the existing staffs of all the departments, and the object of the Bill is to centralize the purchasing for all the branches of the Government in one purchasing commission. The members of the House know that all great business concerns of the present day have long since centralized their purchasing in order to obtain the very best results for 'the moneys expended. Some of the benefits that will result from centralized purchasing in such a business body as this will be, first, that instead of purchasing a certain quantity of supplies for one department, this Purchasing Commission will ascertain from all the departments the total quantities of supplies of any given article which they require and will thus be able in one purchase to secure all the articles of any given class which all the branches of the Government may require. In purchasing under these conditions the commission should, and no doubt will, obtain in many cases all the desired supplies at a lower price than would be possible in the purchase of smaller quantities by different departments. There will be an advantage in having a body oi men devoting their whole attention to the business of purchasing Government supplies. Purchasing to-day has become almost a science in the large business concerns of the country. Men of the highest ability are appointed to this responsible task in order that the institutions with
which they are connected may obtain the benefit of their skill and ability. In making purchases in this way the Government will have the benefit of a thoroughly efficient organization. I am sure that members of the House will be interested to know what the total purchases of the Government amount to from year to year. During the past two or three years purchases have, of course, been enormous. Purchasing under normal conditions would not be on as large a scale as during the war years. But it must also be borne in mind that during the war years the purchase of supplies for many departments has been on a very limited scale. Some departments have been keeping the purchase of supplies down to the lowest limit and when normal conditions return the volume of supplies required by these branches of the Government will be substantially larger than the volume required during the period of the war. The estimate of the commission is that the annual purchases for the Government will be not less than $40,000,000. They have been much more than that during the war period.

Under this system the standard of the goods will be set down, samples will have to be submitted, and if the commission does its duty-and I believe it will; if it does not, it is for the House to see that it does-they will see that if goods bid on are claimed to be superior, those goods must be proved to be superior. I think, therefore., that the arguments advanced with regard to certain defects in the purchasing system will really tend to strengthen this Bill in the estimation of the House.
The people are looking to the Government to set an example of efficiency and justice
in the conduct of the business of the country. We are undertaking responsibilities in a business way which we never thought would be necessary. We have undertaken the operation of great railroad systems, and if this Government does not adopt a sound, honest, and efficient policy with regard to such business as the purchasing for the different departments, the country will not have confidence in its ability even to direct, through its officials, the National Railway System
I have had some experience in connection with the organization of just such a department as this. A large business which was organized some twenty years ago and which controls a number of amalgamated factories, saw the advisability of uniting the purchasing branches of the various departments in a central head office. Accordingly, they adopted that system, continued it ever since, and have found it most successful. The point brought out by the President of the Council (Hon. Mr. Rowell) with regard to the desirability of buying in quantities was one of the advantages which commended itself to the firm.
Moreover, the requirements of the different departments are varied, and considerable loss will result to the country unless there is some method of transferring goods from one department to another in the case of there being a surplus stock on hand. It is the duty of this commission to know the stocks of goods in the various departments, and to see that goods are transferred from one department to another if it is to the advantage of the country that that should be done.
This is an opportune time for this ques-* tion to come before the House. Yesterday the Budget was presented by our able Finance Minister (Sir Thomas White) in a masterly way. He advised us to produce and to save; and in adopting, the day following the Budget, a system of purchasing which, in my opinion, will save this country millions of dollars, is establishing a very good object lesson.
I had the privilege a short time ago of calling at the offices of the War Purchasing Commission where I had an interview with Mr. W. P. Gundy and I wish to endorse the words uttered by the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Kowell) with regard to the services of the late Mr. Gundy to Canada and also with regard to the services of the other gentlemen who gave their time untiringly to the work of this commission.

I was tela that when the commission first asked for prices on typewriters, they received from all the companies the same price based upon the price for a quantity of ten. The commission protested against this and said that as the Government was a very large purchaser it v/as entitled to a further discount, and the commission were given a further discount of ten per cent which represents a very substantial saving. I was also informed that in their purchases of Kraft paper which are very large, they were able to buy it at ten per cent less than any one else.
With regard to boots, since the establishment of the War Purchasing Commission in May, 1915, over two and a quarter million pairs of boots have been purchased. When tenders were called in 1918, the boot manufacturers blamed the tanners of leather because prices had advanced so much, and they in turn, blamed trade conditions. By co-operation with the War Trade Board, a fair price for leather was arranged with the tanners; a fair price for boots was then arranged with the makers, and I give the House these figures as an instance of the work of the War Purchasing Commission in this large item which is much more important than some of the smaller ones to which they could not give the same attention. The United States' boots cost $6.45 per pair as against our price of $5.40 for Canadian pattern, and a3 regards British War Office pattern, the United States' price ranged from $7.15 to $9.05 per pair according to size as against our price of $6 for all sizes. That demonstrates that the War Purchasing Commission have done a most useful service to Canada during the past few years.
Purchases amounting to $200,000,000 were made or supervised by this commission, and the work they did must have taxed their time both night and day. From May 4, 1915, to May 31,1918, the commission held 672 sessions, and they passed upon items which were entered on minutes, the minutes of those meetings numbering 22,610. From April 1, 1918, to the third week cf February, 1919, they held 277 sessions, and they passed 15,000 minutes. The increase during the past year was due to the fact that there was placed upon the commission the additional labour of supervising purchases of all other departments of Government.
They were entrusted with making adjust-' ments on $8,000,000 worth of salmon that the Government took over, and they were successful in arranging a satisfactory price

between the canners and the British Food Minister. They were also entrusted with adjusting the cancellations of $8,000,000 worth of orders after the armistice, and they were successful in adjusting these cancellations on a compensation of less than ten per cent. They also had in hand the sale of surplus stores of the Department of Militia and Defence and the Department of the Naval Service. These articles which were left over after the armistice were disposed of by the commission, I believe, in a fair and a reasonable way. The commission also had charge of arranging the rates for the transportation of troops by rail. The first-class rate was arranged at one and one-half cents per mile where there were over 350 troops in the same train or being transported at the same time, and when there were less than 350, the rate was two cents per mile. The commission also arranged for the transportation of officers and men from overseas; the rate for officers averaging $61, and for men $.35.
If any hon. member has any doubt as to the desire of the commission to carry out, in a businesslike, just and fair way, the policy of calling for tenders, he should visit the offices of the War Purchasing Commission and make personal investigations. I had an opportunity of looking over their files in which their tenders were recorded, the books and files showing clearly what each company bid, which tender was accepted and the reason for such acceptance. I have here, without any names, some facts that will demonstrate how this policy was carried out.
For example, this is a purchase of 200 sanitary flat-top desks of a certain adopted pattern. Twenty-four firms were asked to tender; eighteen replied, of whom fourteen quoted, the tenders ranging from $9,900 to $6,300, and the lowest tender was accepted.
This is a purchase of medical supplies. Sixteen firms quoted, the total of the highest tenders was $1,969.50, and the accepted tenders totalled $1,281.
This is a purchase of surgical supplies. Fourteen firms quoted, the total of the highest tender being $2,098.30, and the accepted tenders totalled $765.80.
Of another purchase of medical supplies seventeen tenders were received, the highest bids totalling $4,069.68, and the accepted tenders totalled $2,916.88.
On a purchase of drugs, seventeen tenders were received, the highest bids totalling $7,598.85, and the accepted tenders totalled $5,014.21.

On another purchase of medical supplies, the highest tenders totalled $940.80, and the accepted tenders totalled $611.94.
On a further purchase of medical supplies, the highest tenders totalled $4,046.54, and the accepted tenders totalled $2,701.44.
Those figures should demonstrate to the House the necessity for having this business handled by men who are experts in the different lines, and also of having this business open to the free tender of any *Canadian citizen who thinks he is in a position to bid for the business. I do not see how it is going to be possible for the country to get a proper system of purchasing except by adopting the policy laid down in this Bill. Probably some modifications will have to be- made to the Bill, but I believe the general principles of it are absolutely sound and will commend themselves to the good judgment of the members of the House as well as to the general public. It will give the people of Canada a square deal, and they are certainly entitled to a square deal from the public servants in charge of the country's business.
This is the first occasion on which I have had the honour of addressing you, Sir, and Ufeel it a great privilege to be able to say a few words of congratulation on the Government's action in this respect. I believe this measure will help to demonstrate to the people of Canada that this Government desires to do the right thing in its administration.

The section as it passed this House read:
Whenever any person other than a Canadian citizen advocates in Canada the overthrow, etc.
Now, a person can do a good many things of this character by other means than advocating. The substituted section reads as follows:
Section fifteen of the Act to amend The Immigration Act passed at the present session of Parliament is repealed, and the following is. substituted therefor:-	.
""41. (1) Every person who by word or act in Canada seeks to overthrow by force or violence the government of or constituted law and authority in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland or of Canada, or of any of the provinces of Canada, or the government of any other of His Majesty's dominions, colonies, possessions or dependencies, or who in Canada defends or suggests the unlawful destruction of property-
That is new. That is one who advocates or suggests the unlawful destruction of property.
.-or by word or act creates or attempts to create any riot or public disorder in Canada, or who without lawful authority assumes any powers of government in Canada

That is new. That is any person who assumes any authority without lawful justification.
-assumes any powers of government in Canada or in any part thereof, or who by common repute belongs to or is suspected of belonging to any secret society or organization which extorts money from or in any way attempts to control any resident of Canada by force or by threat of bodily harm, or by blackmail-
The original section merely referred to blackmail. That is extended a little so as to include any person who belongs to any secret society or organization which attempts to extort money from or in any way to control any resident of Canada through force, or threat of bodily harm or of blackmail.
__or who is a member of or affiliated with any
organization entertaining or teaching disbelief in or opposition to organized government shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to belong to the prohibited or undesirable classes, and shall be liable to deportation in the manner provided by this Act, and it shall be the duty of any officer becoming cognizant thereof and of the clerk, secretary or other official of any municipality in Canada wherein any such person may be forthwith to send a written complaint to the minister, giving full particulars : provided, that this section shall not apply to any person who is a British subject, either by reason of birth in Canada, or by reason of naturalization in Canada.
Then there is a second subsection reading as follows:

Proof that any person belonged to or was within the description of any of the prohibited or undesirable classes within the meaning of this section at any time since the 4th day of May, 1910-
That is the date on which the present Immigration Act was assented to.
-shall for all the purposes of this Act be deemed to establish prima facie that he still belongs to such prohibited or undesirable class or classes.
What I understand that to mean is that if a person, by act or word, at any time since 1910, has done the things we have enumerated in this section then, prima facie, that person would be deemed to belong to these classes. While there is some material difference between the two sections still the main purpose of the section is as it was expressed in the section as originally introduced to the House.

My hon. friend quoted "" The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom "".
He went on to argue the point later by explaining that while he really said the Lord,"" he meant ""Parliament."" I can only say that if Parliament is to be judged in its personnel and ability by the length and irrelevance of a speech such as we have just heard, then I think to make ""Parliament"" and ""the Lord"" exchangeable terms is very unflattering to the Deity. That is

all I have to say about that. My hon. friend discoursed on many subjects that had very little to do with the measure before the House; indeed, I was almost raising a point of order until I began, towards the end of his speech, to get a glimmering idea that what he was really apprehensive of was that the constitution was going to be entirely smashed by a commission which is created to do the business of Government and Parliament in a little more businesslike manner.
The hon. member laboured the point a great deal, and several other members opposite have also laboured the same point during the last few weeks of the horrible autocracy that they allege has been existing in this Government for the last three or four years, the usurpation of the rights and powers of the people, the autocratic methods employed by government by Order in Council, and he and those who have spoken along the same lines seem persistently to forget either deliberately or unconsciously that there has been no such thing as an autocratic Government, because Parliament has put into the hands of the Government certain powers which the Government exercises, and hawing exercised them is responsible to this Parliament for what it has done. My hon. friend has used some very extraordinary arguments in support of the position which he has now expressed in the shape of a motion. Before he commenced that kind of argument, he complained that during the war the Government had had a very free hand in the expenditure of public money, but, he said, as we have now come to times of peace, the Government must exercise a closer control of its expenditures; there must be greater economy; there must be a reduction and an economy, the old watchword that is coupled with the name of Alexander Mackenzie whose example, I may say, my hon. friend and some of his friends did not always follow. He referred to the Minister of Railways' extravagance of expenditure, and I do not like to allow his reference to pass, because last night I listened to the Minister of Railways, and if the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) will pardon me, I must say I think his reference was very unfair, I would almost say grossly unfair, if that is parliamentary, to the minister who is not at present in the House. I took down his words while he was speaking, and he stated that the Minister of Railways, in regard to the Welland canal and the Trent canal had stated that the work that was

being done was practically useless. Those were his exact words, and he stated that the minister went on with those works only under the flimsy pretext of employing soldiers. I think if my hon. friend is going to contend that a fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, he had better bea/r his own words in mind and start getting wise before he so greatly misquotes the words uttered by a responsible minister of the Crown last night. He certainly cannot find in the statement made by the Minister of Railways that these works were practically useless, and that it was a flimsy pretext to go on. What the minister argued was that while there might not be a pressing necessity for going on with this work immediately, in view of the fact that there were thousands of soldiers returning to Canada and looking for work and also a great deal of unemployment in the country, which might create a dangerous situation, he thought it best to go on with the work now instead of at a later date. I will leave it tp the House if that is not a fair statement of the situation.

Ottawa, June 4, 1919. The Right Honourable
Sir Robert Borden, G.C.M.G.,
Prime Minister of Canada.
Ottawa.
My Dear Sir Robert,-The Government, in its consideration of the Budget to be placed before Parliament to-morrow, has reached, I take it, definite and final conclusions as- to the form it will take. As you are aware, I am not in accord with it and therefore cannot support it, either in the House or in the country. Having reached this decision, there is only one course for me to follow, and I therefore tender you herewith my resignation as a member of the Government. The reason for my decision shall be given more fully when the subject is under discussion in the House.
In view of the fact that the military business of the war, through demobilization, is not yet completed, permit me to say that only strong conviction upon this issue, reached after
earnest consideration, impels me to take this course.
I cannot refrain from expressing my appreciation of the heavy worries and responsibilities you have so courageously faced during the war, and particularly in the last year-worries and responsibilities which I venture to say the people of Canada do not yet fully understand ; and also the fine manner in which you have represented Canada overseas in the delicate and difficult negotiations preliminary to the signing of Peace.
Let me also thank you very sincerely indeed for the many courtesies and kindnesses you have shown during the past eighteen months, to one quite inexperienced in Parliamentary work and in the very intricate and difficult problems of Government in this country.
I am,
Yours truly,
(Sgd.) T. A. Crerar.
To which the following reply was given on the same day:
Ottawa, June 4, 1919.
My dear Mr. Crerar,-I have received with deep and unfeigned regret your resignation as a member of the Government; but I entirely appreciate and respect the sincerity of the convictions which have impelled you to take that course.
It will be my immediate duty to acquaint His Excellency the Governor General with your decision and to request his authority for the acceptance of your resignation.
During the period of nearly two years in which you have been one of my colleagues your high sense of public duty, your fine ability and your indefatigable energy have made your service to the country especially valuable. Within that period problems of an exceptionally difficult character have continually presented themselves and I am most grateful to you, and to all my colleagues, for the loyal assistance and earnest effort which on all such occasions have been of invaluable assistance to me in the consideration of such questions.
My association with you as one of my colleagues will j^ways be to me a happy memory; and I know that I may express this to you on behalf of all the members of the Government.
I am very grateful for your kind words in respect to my own part in public affairs since it has been my privilege to have you as one of my colleagues.
With every good wish, believe me, dear Mr. Crerar,
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) R. L. Borden.
Hon. T. A. Crerar, M.P.,
Ottawa.



The resignation has been accepted informally, as appears from the correspondence, and it will be accepted in the usual formal manner by Order in Council tomorrow.

The great objection to this commission business is that there is no one responsible. The commissioners are responsible to no minister directly. The War Purchasing Commission has been run by two or three clerks, engineered by the commission and fortunes have been built up for the favourites of the commissioners, contracts have gone almost invariably in the right direction, and I have no hesitation in saying that if the facts were made known as to the way in which the War Purchasing Commission conducted its business they would startle the people of Canada. They would be astonished at the tremendously high prices that have been paid. This whole system of Government has been running away from responsibility. I went into the war to overthrow autocracy and bring about responsible government in so far as we possibly could in Germany, in other countries and above all in Canada. This is a departure from responsible government, and it places in the hands of a commission the spending of $40,000,000 a year. If you will give me the management of that business, under the terms of this Bill, I will undertake to put any party in power at the next general election. If you have a purchasing agent for the department, the minister is responsible, he feels his responsibility, and he takes pains to see that the work is done in an efficient manner. I had to do with that business and I do not think there are anything like the irregularities going on that the general public claim there are in reference to these matters. I found that contractors were anxious to do the best they could, although there was an odd one here and there that had to be watched. I found the officers in almost all the departments toe keenest men alive. I have seen instances where contractors who had succeeded in bluffing the War Purchasing Commission tried to put the same bluff over

the purchasing agent of the department and failed, with the result that the department was able to purchase cheaper than the War Purchasing 'Commission did. When an analysis was made it was found that the prices paid by the War Purchasing Commission were for almost all commodities, higher, I know instances where local men were asked to give a quotation and their quotations were fifty per cent under the price that the War Purchasing Commission was furnishing to the department. I know of the manipulations that went on by the War Purchasing Commission to see that contracts were landed in the right centre. There will be under this system no direct responsibility and we must have responsibility when we are dealing with the administration of such- large sums as this. I agree with the objection which has been pointed' out by my hon. frien/d from Red Deer (Mr. Clark) on the question of responsibility. The minister of the department for which the purchases are made is not responsible and no one will care except the young purchasing agents who will make their millions out of it if they are permitted to go on long enough. One of the presidents of a large American railway corporation said: I would rather be president of the Inter-State Commerce Commission than president of the United States at $750,000 a year. The gentleman who will get the management of this commission will consider himself one of the most successful operators in the Dominion of Canada. The whole thing is an attempt to get this Government away from its responsibility to the House, to the members and to the people and that is one of the things that I want to fight against. Let the members be responsible to the people who elect them and let the people hold the members responsible. I am not afraid of that responsibility in my county, I never have been afraid and I never had a bit of trouble with any one in connection with this matter. Let the members, for once in the history of Canada, hold the ministers responsible.

NICHOLSON:,,PURCHASING OF DEPARTMENTAL AND OTHER SUPPLIES.,,,"There may be a purchasing agent in every department, but whether he is expert or not I do not know. If there is a purchasing agent in every department, the hon. member's question seems to imply that he would prefer to have a purchasing agent in every government department. But this Bill would eliminate separate purchasing agencies and concentrate the business under one department. We can amend the details of the Bill, but at the present moment we are dealing with principles. Take the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, whose system is divided into departments from coast to coast. There is not a department, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, that can buy a single dollar's worth of material without going through the purchasing department, because the men at the heads of the various departments are not purchasers and do not understand that business. They are managers and devote their attention to the conduct of the business of their particular departments. But they leave to experts the question of purchases and allow them to buy the goods they require. It has been objected that by employing a purchasing agency the Government is getting rid of its responsibility. If the Government concentrates the whole purchasing for the Dominion in one agency, is that evading responsibility to any greater degree than if it distributes the responsibility throughout a multitude of agencies? From the information that we have now, each head of a department purchases the supplies for that particular department in his own way. If this work is all concentrated in one purchasing department for which the

Government is directly responsible, does the Government thereby lessen its responsibility to the country? In my judgment it would only narrow the business down to a point where it would be controllable. As things stand now, it is uncontrollable and unwieldly. My hon. friend from Red Deer, with whom I always try to agree, has laid down the principle that you cannot effect economy unless you reduce the number of employees. If there is one man in each department to-day charged with purchasing for that department, and if he is capable of doing the work with which he is charged, lie cannot be of very much use for anything else. Therefore, taking that phase of the argument alone, if you bring all thesj men under one head and employ one purchasing agent nr agency, you will have eliminated a certain number of employees. 1 presume, without, having any figures before me. that this Government purchases millions of dollars' worth of goods every year and, I have no doubt, will continue to purchase equally large amounts annually from all sources. Is it not conceivable that by reducing the cost at which these goods are purchased and improving the character and quality of the goods and obtaining the best materials that can be put into each particular article, just as any ordinary business man would do, a saving could be effected? A large departmental store could not carry on business for six months if it permitted the heads of the various selling departments to act as purchasers at the same time. No large organization producing goods in this country could successfully operate on such a basis. A lumber firm could not carry on business ii the man who had charge of the work in the woods had to purchase the goods required in connection with the conduct of the business. In principle, I think the Government is starting out along the right lines. I have not read the details of the Bill. They may not be right, and the idea of a purchasing commission may be wrong. If, as the hon. member for North 'Oxford (Mr. Nesbitt) says, it is going to involve the employment of a commission and then a director, that would seem to me to be a case of overlapping, and if it is going to mean the employment of a large establishment, that again is entirely unnecessary. But with the principle of concentrating the whole business of purchasing the country's goods and placing it under the head of an expert or a small group of experts, I am entirely in accord, and contend that it will bear

analysis by any business man who wants to study it and ascertain what he would do il he were in the same position as the Government. I venture to say that if hon. members who have spoken were carrying on business for themselves, they would not even attempt to operate on any other basis than that outlined in the chief principle of this Bill, namely, the employing of experts to do work that necessarily calls for expert knowledge and a thorough acquaintance with a particular subject. Those who purchase supplies should thoroughly understand purchasing.

As I understand the proposition, it is not quite as outlined by 'the hon. member for Algoma (Mr. Nicholson). In my judgment the purpose of this Bill is not to establish a department such as the hon. member, has in mind-a central authority for the purchasing of all supplies of the various government departments-but to perpetuate under another name a department already in existence. I have had some slight experience with the War Purchasing Commission, and from that experience and actual knowledge I cannot agree with the claims made by the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowrell) who has charge of the Bill, that it has been an unqualified success.
I will call the attention of the House and of the President of the Council to a case in point. A tender was advertised in August last for 500 four-drawer filing cabinets. It had been the custom of the department to buy steel cabinets, it being claimed by the manufacturers that they were fireproof. A manufacturing firm that I am not directly interested in, beyond the fact that it is located in the riding which I have the honour to represent, manufactures filing cabinets of oak-precisely the same in operation, but made of wood. The contention of the department was, of course, that the steel cabinets, being fireproof, were to be preferred, notwithstanding the much higheT cost.
This manufacturing concern sought my services in regard to securing for them a ""look in"" on tenders for this class of material, and I found that it was almost impossible to help them. In passing I might just say that this purchasing board is a mere ""lean-to"" of the Public Works Department; it is not a separate entity in any sense of the word-a fact which I will illustrate later on. When I approached the Public Works Department I was told that it would be necessary for this manufacturing concern, with my assistance, to institute a propaganda through the various departments in order to secure endorsation by the departmental heads of wood instead of

steel cabinets. I do not think that it should be necessary either for a manufacturing concern or for members to indulge in such propaganda. If we were in a position to convince the department that it was in the public interest to buy these wooden cabinets, it should be the duty of some person to act accordingly. We were referred to the War Purchasing Board, and with no better results. They treated us in exactly the same way; that is to say, they took the position that it was none oi their business The requisitions were sent into the War Purchasing Commission, and they simply rubber stamped them and passed them on to the Public Works Department, which made the purchases. I do not think you can convince any intelligent business man that doing business along those lines is in the interest of this country or of the public service.
The contract for the 500 filing cabinets that I have in mind was tendered for at the rate of $41 for each steel cabinet. The same cabinet exactly in dimensions and in actual service, but made of oak, was obtainable at $27. That represents a saving of $14 on each cabinet, or an actual saving on the entire contract of $7,000. When I convinced the Minister of Public Works of this feature of the transaction, there was no difficulty whatever; an order was placed for the wooden cabinets. I understand he has given instructions that no further orders shall be given for steel cabinets. Whether that is correct or not, I am not sure, but that is my information.
During the course of my investigation I found that in the preceding fourteen months 2,500 steel cabinets were ordered at an average cost of $49 each, as against $27 for the wooden cabinet, or the enormous difference of $55,000. In other words, it cost the country $55,000 more for the cabinets purchased during the previous year through the War Purchasing Commission; and it must be remembered that this is merely one sample of work that happened to come to my personal knowledge. In the fourteen months the War Purchasing Commission had actually thrown away $62,000 of the public funds. If that is to be taken as a measure of the value of the service rendered by this 'Commission to the country, then, Sir, I say the sooner we dispense with it the better.
I agree with the ideal condition enunciated by the .member for Algoma, but 1 take exception to some of the examples he referred to. For instance, he stated that it is the custom with most of the large de-

partmental stores of this country to have purchasing agents independent of the heads of the various departments. I am sure he does not wish to be incorrect, but as a matter of fact he is not correct, because I know whereof I speak. The men who have charge of the departments in such stores are entirely responsible for their particular departments. They are experts in. their own line, and they do the buying and they supervise the selling. That is beyond doubt. But that is a different position altogether to the purchasing of supplies for the Dominion Government or for a large corporation like the Canadian. Pacific Bailway. It would be to the benefit of this country if such purchasing could toe done under the supervision of the head o.f a .department as outlined by the member for North Oxford; that, I think, would be an ideal condition. There is no need 'to establish another department of the public service with its elaborate staff to purchase the necessary supplies for the various departments, even if they do amount, as is claimed by the President of the Council, to the enormous sum iof $40,000,000 a year. Such purchasing could be effected by a less elaborate staff than is outlined in this Bill.
Other points I purpose to discuss at greater length when, the Bill is in the Committee stage; but there is one section I would like to call to the attention of the minister, and that is the section destroying the effective service of the whole proposition. I refer to section 12, subsection 2.
The commission shall have no authority to change or vary any requisition.
That is just exactly the position taken by the Commission in the case I have called attention to. When I appealed to them to listen to the arguments of the manufacturer of wooden cabinets, they said, "" We have nothing to do with that. We would not think of interfering with a requisition handed in to us by the head of a department."" That is a vital point in the service to be rendered by such a commission. They should be in a position, to dictate to any department the class of goods required for the Government service.
If a department requisitions gold-plated spittoons, I suppose the Purchasing Commission would have no authority to say; you cannot have them gold-plated; ordinary copper will have to do. If waste-paper baskets costing $32 were requisitioned, I suppose the commission would have no authority to change or vary the requisition. If a department ordered extravagant furni-

ture of any kind, I suppose the commission would have no authority to interfere. They simply rubber-stamp the requisition, it goes in as a matter of course, no matter what its character may be. I submit that this Bill is a monstrous thing, and that subsection 2 of section 12 destroys whatever value there might otherwise be in the proposal.

I do not quarrel with the principle of the Bill, although it seems to me that if you have a staff of expert purchasers you may create a department whidh will be a very great expense to the country. I have had many complaints from the superintendents of the different works in the county from which I come with respect to purchases. Most of the dredging plants in Manitoba are located in that county, as well as the fishing industries, dry docks, and other-public works; and the purchases there are considerable each year. The St. Andrew's locks are also located in that county. I am informed that under the present system goods which are purchased are costing more than they cost under the old system. ll do not know how correct that is; up to the present I have not had a chance of looking into the matter. As I understand it, under the old system the heads of the departments there were allowed to do the purchasing, and they were in a position to buy more cheaply because of their particular knowledge of the requirements. I do not know whether these purchases were made by the Purchasing 'Commission or not; the requisitions were made to the district engineer at Winnipeg. Circulars were sent out to these wholesale houses in	Winnipeg-I	do not think
they went outside of Winnipeg-and the purchases were made from those wholesale houses. The local men in the town of Selkirk, in which these industries are located, were not given a chance to bid on these purchases; notices were not sent to them at all. I am informed that if these men had had an opportunity of tendering they could have (furnished these supplies more cheaply than they were furnished by the wholesale houses of Winnipeg, because the cost of the supplies, including freight, cartage, and other incidental charges, was greater than it would have been had the purchases been made in the town of Selkirk by the superintendents of the different public works.
We should be careful at this time not to create any more commissions which will be a burden to the country. Under the old system, if it was properly carried out, we would be in a better position to get value for our money than we will be if purchases are made through a commission
5 p.m. who will really, in any case, have to take the word of the -superintendents of the different departments. They have no other means of finding out whether or not the supplies are necessary; they must aocept the advice of the superintendents of the different works. These superintendents are on the -spot; they know what is required, and they should be trusted to make the purchases for their departments.
I believe that complaints were made to the Public Works Department with regard to the right of the superintendents to make small purchases, and that the superintendents have been allowed to purchase only to the extent of $5. I would like this Bill to provide that the superintendents be -allowed to purchase up to a greater amount than that; I believe money woul-d be saved if they were. They should be allowed to purchase such articles as steam fittings and pipes, and other articles which they may need and which can be secured in almost any town in which these public works are located. Time and money would be saved by adopting this plan. In cases where requisitions have been made to the District Engineer at Winnipeg for supplies amounting to $25 or $30, delays have occurred and the job has had to wait until the supplies came to hand. )If, in cases like that, the superintendent had the right to purchase locally up to a certain amount, time and money would he saved, the work would proceed without interruption and the country would be benefited.
I ask -the minister in charge of the Bill to give this matter, whidh is one of great importance to the country, careful consideration, and to see whether some arrangement can be made under which purchases may be made by the men in charge of -these different public works throughout the country.

Looking hack upon conditions as they were before and as they were after -that commission was established, I have not -the slightest doubt that many

millions of dollars were saved to the people of this country by the course which I took in the spring of 1915. I have been in this Parliament for nearly twenty-three years, and I know something of 'the methods by which Government purchases have been made in the past, and I remember very distinctly the discussion and the suspicion which have frequently been aroused in connection with them. Every one who has been a member of this House, or has taken an interest in public affairs during past years, knows that the cry of unfair use of political power in respect of Government purchases was almost as strong, if not quite as strong, as the cry with respect to appointments to the public service. The principle upon which this Bill is founded. The principle upon which the Orders in Council were passed when I put forward the recommendation therefor in the spring of 1915 is precisely the same as that which has conferred very important powers upon the Civil Service Commission. That principle leads to such administration of public business as shall eliminate party political influence. The Government does not desire to abdicate responsibility; it would be absolutely impossible for it to abdicate responsibility even if it desired to do so. Whether you carry out purchases by a dozen different purchasing commissions, as has been the practice in the past, or by one purchasing commission, as is proposed by this Bill, the responsibility of the Government is the same.
A Government cannot shelter itself behind the acts of officials; it must accept responsibility for the acts of every official. If he is wrong, dispense with him, or if he is an official of the character proposed here, who can be removed only by vote of Parliament., bring his case to Parliament and ask Parliament to deal with him. In any case the responsibility of the Government continues from beginning to end.
I should be very sorry if the idea should prevail in this country that r would be better to return to a system under which beyond question political pressure and influence were- put forward and utilized, and not to adhere to a system under which, so far as I know, there has been an absolute lack of any suggestion that in making public purchases any interest except that of the public was regarded. I can say this further, that to mv mind it is exceedingly important that the time of members of the Government, which was inevitably taken up with such matters under the former system, should be free from such demands, 
and that tney should be able to say to members of Parliament and to all others: It is the duty of the particular department in question to put forward its requisition for supplies it may reasonably require, and when that requisition is put forward, you have the assurance of an absolutely independent commission that those supplies will be purchased with a sole eye to the public interest and with an absolute disregard of whether the persons who furnish those supplies belong to any political party or class. I repeat that in the public interest it is highly important that ministers of the Crown should not have their time taken up with claims put forward by persons who conceive themselves entitled to consideration. I know that my time was by no means free from questions and difficulties of that character before the Purchasing Commission was established in 1915; but since that commission was established, I do not believe that on an average one hour a month has been occupied with any such matter.
The hon. member for South Renfrew (Mr. Pedlow) has criticised the commission in respect of matters for which it is in no wise responsible. We never intended to give, nor do we now give the commission power to dictate to any department. Occasionally, during the past four years the members of the War Purchasing Commission have said this to me: There is such and such a requisition for an enormous quantity of supplies for war purposes; we really think this subject should be brought to your attention, because it seems to us. although we have no right to dictate, that the proposed supply is much greater than should reasonably be required. I have taken up the matter, and in many cases the representations of the War Purchasing Commission to me in that regard have resulted in a considerable reduction of the supplies ordered and purchased. After all it is simply a question of whether it is better to disperse the purchasing organization over fifteen, sixteen or seventeen departments, or to concentrate it under one systematic management. Apart from the considerations to which I have alluded, that is the chief question.
I am not going into the details of this Bill. We shall be glad of the advice and suggestions of every member of this House respecting the particular methods and proposals. We have an entirely open mind in regard to that. But I think it is my duty to say that, if there is any suggestion that the men whom I invited to undertake these

duties and who have carried them on during the past four years, have not given their full time, energy and attention to the purpose for which they have been appointed, that statement has no foundation whatever and that criticism is wholly undeserved. I know personally of the time and devotion that they have given to 1 this work, of the high and earnest sense of public duty with which they have approached it. I know further, that if the members of the Purchasing Commission had seen fit to do what I more than once urged them to do, namely to give a succinct and clear statement to the people of this country of the economies which they have made in purchases since they were first appointed in 1915, the proposals which are now presented to this House would be received with very much greater favour than has been apparent this afternoon. I, myself, have from time to time, discussed with Mr. George P. Galt, Mr. W. P. Gundy and Sir Hormisdas La-porte what the War Purchasing Commission has accomplished in economies and in saving of the funds of the public treasury during the past four years. I did no-t realize the full measure of their effective effort until casually I was told of it, sometimes; and I urged the members of the commission to prepare such a statement to be laid on the Table as would describe in suitable terms what had been accomplished in that regard. These men have been thoroughly devoted to their public duty; they have served without remuneration, and any reproaches which I have heard this afternoon aire, in my judgment, absolutely and wholly undeserved.
I desire to associate myself with what the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowell) said with regard .to the services of Mr. W. P.

I recollect very well that a few weeks after Mr. W. P. Gundy, who was a very able business man and whom I had never met before, was appointed to this commission, had come here to undertake his duties, he approached me one day and told me that he was not only intensely gratified but greatly surprised at the exceedingly efficient organization which had been built
up in the period before he became a member of the War Purchasing Commission.
We submitted to the commissioners as they were in September, 1918, the question as to making the commission permanent, and we asked them to set forth their views with regard to the matter and to put forward to us proposals which they would recommend in case the commission were to be a permanent one. The members of the commission at that time were Sir Hormisdas Laporte, Mr. George F. Palt and Mr. W. P. Gundy. I think I might, with advantage, read to the House some of the purely business considerations which they presented to me in a memorandum strongly advocating the continuance of the commission. They furnished this memorandum, of course, with the desire and intention to be relieved themselves from the duty of serving further upon the commission, and therefore, there was no personal interest which could have affected their judgment in the slightest degree. As a matter of fact, 'Sir Hormisdas Laporte has remained here discharging the duty of commissioner at great personal inconvenience, and more than that, great personal loss during the past five or six months. The disadvantages in the existing system, by which each department makes its own purchases, are according to their view these

will take the context of the Minister of Railway's remarks, I do not think he will find that the minister said it was useless, whatever objections he may have raised in regard to the Trent canal years ago, and I do* not think my hon. friend can twist the statement of the Minister of Railways into a statement that the work was practically useless. I thought it worth while to refer to this, especially as the motives and results as regards the soldiers have been very frankly and fully stated to the House by the Minister of Railways.
Let me refer to another argument of my hon. friend, and one which seemed to me rather extraordinary. He asked: Is this
present commission necessary? Is it necessary to make what was a temporary 'body during the war, a permanent body now that peace has come? My hon. friend referred to the absence of British blood in his veins, but said in passing that he had that French logic in his anatomy that would make reason apparent in his argument. All I can say is that there is* not much logic when my hon. friend says in one breath that the purchases during the war, which amounted to very large sums, made the creation of a commission necessary, because it protected the public treasury, and then at the same time argues that the commission is not necessary, because, apparently, the public treasury has not to be protected in times of peace. If his argument was true in times of war, it would, with the exception that there may not be so great purchases now, be equally justified in times of peace. My hon. friend seems to argue-and this is his main argument-that in some strange way we are smashing the constitution because a commission is being appointed to transact the business of buying the various departmental needs and requirements. He pointed out that under the old method there was governmental responsibility, ministerial responsibility, that the requisitions passed through several hands; that they were carefully scrutinized by the officials of the department, the deputy minister and so on, and that, therefore, there were all the necessary safeguards. Surely, my hon. friend cannot so misunderstand the purport of this Bill as not to know that the needs and requirements of the various departments for the requisitions that are put up will go through the same processes so far as requisitions go. As far as knowing what the actual needs of the department are, the department will be responsible, and those matters will be placed before the commission in the net result of a requisition for departmental requirements. The commission which has been established is not for requisitions; the responsibility for that is on the department, but it is for the purpose of putting in a business organization which will gather up all the multitudinous threads going through sixteen or eighteen departments where, perhaps, there may be seven or eight different experts or officers buying the same type of thing, into the hands of the central business organization which will be in touch with the whole of them. I cannot see what my hon. friend is afraid of in the way of responsibility. The minister will have to

come to this House; he will, after all, be responsible for what his department needs, and although the commission on account of its knowledge of the requirements of all the departments is created to do the actual buying certain responsibilities will rest with the minister of each department.
My hon. friend urges-and I thought this was a somewhat curious and illogical argument-that in some mysterious way the establishment of this commission would clip the claws of the Auditor General.
How on earth the Auditor-General's claws are to be clipped by a commission of this kind doing the actual purchasing, I fail to see. His functions are not interfered with one iota by this commission; he will discharge his functions in precisely the same way after the establishing of this commis-ion as before. It was a new doctrine, I think, to this House which the hon. member laid down when he said that the Auditor General was the nightmare of an honest minister. I thought he was the nightmare of a dishonest minister. Fear of the Auditor General would not be entertained by an honest minister; he has nothing to fear from the Auditor General. I cannot see in any shape or form how the Government or a minister would be abdicating his functions .by adopting practically what every vast business concern with innumerable branches does, namely, centralize the machinery for the actual purchasing of its requirements. My hon. friend in his diatribe on the commission business and on throwing off the responsibility of ministers, surely has not forgotten that the Government of which he was a member established a commission, the Railway Commission-and I have not a word except of praise for its establishment, and had not at the time it was established-which certainly is less responsible than a commission of this kind, because it is far less in contact with the various departments and the ministers. In the whole language used by my hon. friend I have failed to see one argument against the establishment of this commission; I have failed to hear one reason advanced why it would not facilitate public business of the country and of the departments. I fail to see why, to use my hon. friend's words, if it helped matters and safeguarded the public treasury in times of war, it would not equally do so in times of peace. I shall certainly therefore vote against my hon. friend's motion.

closing speech before we divided on this question was very strong in stating that there is no purchasing power in this commission except as it receives requisitions. I think he is mistaken. This section 6 gives the commission absolute power to buy everything, and it can secure a warehouse and store millions of dollars of goods in it for distribution to the different departments as requisitions are filed. The only restriction of that power seems to be in section 14:
The commission shall not, without the approval of the Governor in Council, purchase or agree to purchase any supplies except such as are included in estimates or requisitions sent to the commission by the various portions of the public service.
That is no restriction at all. If the commission comes to the Governor in Council and says that it wants to buy large quantities of goods, the Governor in Council are not very likely to constitute themselves judges as to whether the commission should make those purchases or not. Therefore apparently section 6 gives this body absolute and unresfricted power for the purchase of whatever it may require-and as ,far as using it as an engine for patronage is concerned, it is the worst that was ever introduced into this country.
The fact that what was spread over eighteen or nineteen departments, and was not as strong as it might be on that account, is now given greater force, greater strength, greater momentum, so to speak, by being organized into one department. This is an organized system of patronage, and it will be exercised as such. To a person like myself, who is up against these things every day and knows what is going on, it is laughable-or is it not rather sad?-to hear men who are, no doubt, honest, say that there is no patronage. Why, patronage in connection with Government business is just as it always was. And now we are going to have an institution that will have power to exercise patronage wherever it wants to. If tremendously big

purchases are had in mind; if it is deemed necessary to have rake-offs, corruption, bribery, this is the institution where these things can come in. There is no check on these men, except that of their being supposed to go through the formality of getting the permission of the Government for the purchase of (supplies. The member for Antigonish and Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair) has given us an instance of what
11 p.m. is going on in this Department now. They destroyed what was known as the patronage list, but they have substituted something else that is just as effective

a system of ""selection."" What is the difference between calling a newspaper a ""selected newspaper"" and putting its name on a ""patronage list""? The only difference is that the man who is exercising the patronage may have to make out new lists very frequently-or he may be told to use the old list.
We are told that there is no patronage now in the Civil Service. I admit that the conditions are a little better now as regards to the appointment of returned soldiers, but before that element came in we had nothing but the old-time, hard-and-fast party patronage system. I had two cases last year in my own county. A customs officer and a postmaster had to be appointed, and two of the most ardent Tories in the district were selected for these positions. If that was a coincidence, it was a remarkable one. The same thing has been going on throughout the whole of my county. There is a letter on file in the office of the Civil Service Commission which I wrote in connection with these two positions. I said, in a communication to the Chairman: ""Both officials who occupied these positions were Tories. I will give you the names of two men, one a Liberal and the other a Tory, and I think it is fair that you should appoint these men."" I may add that I was recommending the Tory for the better position of the two. But my recommendation was absolutely ignored ,and two of the choicest brand of Tories were appointed. The minister will excuse me if I have no faith in these professions of the -non-existence of patronage. Patronage is being exercised everywhere, and will continue to he exercised; it cannot be otherwise under present conditions. We know that two of the present members of the Civil (Service Commission are tried and trained Tories. Nobody need tell me that these men are not taking the advice of their friends in different parts of the country as to whom they should appoint. That explains how they got the two men from Bras d'Or in Victoria

County; that is how they are getting men all over the country. Let nobody think for a moment that men can fool the people by making splendid speeches and saying that there iis no patronage. How delighted the people of Ontario were when they heard from the Prime Minister himself that there was no patronage. My friend the President of the Council said ""amen"" to this pronouncement, and people rejoiced and praised the Lord that this great day had arrived. When the Military Service Act was passed, there were some ""amens"" and some ""hosannas"", but there was a louder ""hosanna"" when the President of the Council announced, by telegrams, cables, messages, runners and fiery crosses throughout Ontario, that the Military .Service Act was passed for Quebec, but that it was not to be used in Ontario, and that the farmers' sons were at liberty to do as they liked. But we in this House, are getting .a little too old, a little too hard and crusty, any longer to be entertained by such speeches as we heard this afternoon and this evening from the President of the Council and the Prime Minister on this subject. For my part, .I would have more respect for the judgment and the honesty of hon. gentlemen if they would take things as they are and not try to throw camouflage over the real state of affairs. The truth is too apparent to the dullest person in the House or in the country. So far as patronage is concerned, nothing is different from what it was in the good days when party patronage was exercised by the .party that for the time being held sway in the House of Commons. That is what is going on now, although it is not admitted as it was on other occasions.

SINCLAIR:,,PURCHASING OF DEPARTMENTAL AND OTHER SUPPLIES.,,,"The objection taken was not with regard to the powers of the commission but with regard to the responsibility of the minister. The Secretary of State (Mr. Burrell) laid down very emphatically to-night the doctrine that the establishment of this commission does not affect in the slightest degree the responsibility of the minister and the Government in regard to purchases. I want to know if my hon. friend agrees with the doctrine of the Secretary of State in that connection.

The Public Works Department, for instance, will require certain supplies, and it would simplify matters if the Minister of Public Works were obliged to have an item in his estimates providing for the quantity of supplies he was going to requisition, and that he should not exceed that quantity except for some special reason. It should be provided that the department would be limited to the amounts voted by Parliament. In that way the House would indirectly be in a position to ascertain the operations of the commission.
