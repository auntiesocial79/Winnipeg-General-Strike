SINCLAIR:,,PURCHASING OF DEPARTMENTAL AND OTHER SUPPLIES.,,,"The practice has become prevalent of dispensing with public advertisement in many cases. A department professes to know the number of people who deal in certain articles in some province or vicinity, and instead of calling for tenders by public advertisement they send a circular letter or notice to the dealers. If this can be done in a fair way the practice is satisfactory. But the difficulty is that certain names are omitted from the list in the department and complaints are frequently made, as they were in the case of the War Purchasing Commission, that certain people did not get these notices. It should be easy to provide that in cases of this kind merchants or dealers could send in their names and post office addresses and be entitled to the usual notice.

But I do know the commission has been at great pains to ascertain that the tenders accepted represented good value for the prices paid. Of course, it cannot make tenders come in; all it can do is to require that tenders shall be presented, and it proceeds on the basis of accepting the lowest tender. There may have been some cases where the commission called for further tenders or endeavoured to get lower prices by reason of the first tender being excessive. I am sure that any member who looks into the work of the commission will be satisfied that it has rendered a very conspicuous piece of public service ever since it was inaugurated.

BURNHAM (West Peterborough) :,,PURCHASING OF DEPARTMENTAL AND OTHER SUPPLIES.,,,"I should like to draw the attention of the minister to a little incident which will serve as an illustration of something that has happened very frequently, and may happen much more frequently, very much to the detriment of the member for a constituency. Under the old system it used to be known that tenders for coal were required. Now this Bill does not apply to the wthole system of tendering. Consequently, there is just as much room for inefficiency and for doing evil that there was before. There is no way under Heaven by which business can be properly done if you cannot rely on the honesty of the people doing it. Let me give an instance. Instructions were sent to a janitor to find out how much coal was required, and what the price, would be. He did so, but instead of asking several people what their tenders would be, he asked only one man, and he sent that man's tender to Ottawa. It was accepted, and then the people rose up on their hind * legs and said "" What sort of a member of Parliament are you to allow such work
as this to go on?"" I said "" I, did not do it."" "" Oh, yes, they said, that won't go here. You are the member for this constituency and must watch the Government in everything. You must look into this matter."" So having ascertained the facts, I communicated with the Minister of Public Works, and in due time he communicated with the officer he had employed at Peterborough, one of his own officers, and found I had stated the matter correctly. I said to the Minister of Public Works "" What are you going to do about it? This man is perfectly honest. I do not think he intended to do anything wrong, but the efficiency of your system is now on trial. What are you going to do?"" He replied "" I will have to fine him five dollars."" So the Minister of Public Works fined his own agent in Peterborough for inefficiency in a transaction under this brand-new system which the member had nothing to do with, but which he will' have to watch very carefully.

I have been reading the Bill and I cannot understand the necessity for three commissioners to purchase the supplies for the departments of this Government. I will guarantee to supply them with a man who, if he is furnished with a good, clever stenographer and one or two inspectors, will purchase all the supplies that the Government will require in a year and who, even then will not be any busier than the purchaser for any large institution in this country. Referring to clause 5, I find that the Governor in Council may appoint an officer to be called the director of the Purchasing Commission for Canada. What is he going to do? Is he going to direct the commission how to purchase? As I understand it, the deputy minister, or some other head of a department, may put in a request for supplies and the commission will purchase them. I suppose this director will direct them how to purchase the supplies.

I do not know what else it can mean. I believe that under the present system there is a waste in purchasing for the Government departments, This will mean not merely three commissioners; a whole department will be built up with forty or fifty clerks, stenographers and so on. It will run into a department and a very expensive one. We want to economize. That is what we were told to do yesterday, and by the looks of the financial statement, it is necessary not only as a people but as a Government. I see no economy in this Bill as introduced. I am sorry I did not hear the minister's explanation for it. There may be a reason for it. I understand there is a great deal of waste in the purchasing of supplies by the different departments. This new department will require, I suppose, a lot of typewriters. There are.plenty of typewriters in the different departments that are not in use, but this new department will not have any old typewriters; they will insist on having new typewriters, new furniture, new stationery, almost everything new, and they will not under any possibility gather up equipment that might have been used by commissions and departments that have been abolished. There is no necessity for waste in purchasing if it is properly conducted. Why we want three commissioners to do the purchasing when one man could easily do it, is more than I can comprehend; besides which there is to be another man who is to be called the Director of the Commission. I see no sense in the Bill at all.

to the House the considerations set forth in the report of the War Purchasing Commission, to which report I have already alluded. The disadvantages of the methods which have prevailed in the past were presented to us in this way:
The need for centralization is clearly demonstrated 'by the numerous disadvantages of the present arrangements under which each department makes its own purchases, subject to approval of the War Purchasing' Commission. Some of these disadvantages may be stated as follows:
(a)	Each department is now buying supplies in utter ignorance of what the others are doing.
(b)	The departments generally do not get the benefit of the technical knowledge and experience acquired in each department.
(c)	The quantity of goods required by some of the departments is not sufficient to enable them to purchase at the best prices.
< d) When high prices prevail, owing to shortage of material, this condition is aggravated by competition amongst the Government departments themselves.
(e)	There is a lack of uniformity of specifications and also of inspection.
(f)	Large volume of emergency orders resulting in higher costs and giving opportunity for irregularities and * complaints arising therefrom.
(g)	There is a deplorable lack in the departments of study of market conditions, revisions of specifications, et cetera.
The report continues:
That co-ordination in Government buying would do much to remove or lessen the disadvantages of the present methods is beyond question. Enquiry shows that while each department may require certain supplies which are peculiar to its special needs, yet the larger proportion of the total outlay is for goods common to several departments. If the requirements in a particular line, instead of being ordered separately by each department, were bought collectively by a central purchasing office with its stall of experts for each class of goods, the larger quantities ordered, the elimination of competition among the departments, the decrease in emergency purchases, the adoption of uniform specifications and methods of inspection, and the many other improvements which would be possible would result in an enormous saving of money, and still further remove any temptations to personal favouritism which may now exist or tend to creep in in the future.
Some reference was made this afternoon to the possibility of delay through waiting for the action of a Central Purchasing Commission in respect- of small supplies required by departments of the Government in different- parts of the country. That subject has been under consideration. It was dealt with by a provision in the Order in Council, and as to emergency purchases of that character-small purchases urgently required and as to which it would be quite undesirable to go to the expense of advertising for tenders-there is no reason why these

It is the expectation of the country, therefore, that the era which is now opening up may be a truly democratic era.

So a certain number would remain in each department; I do not know how many; that is a matter to be arranged between the minister of the department and the commission. The others would be available for transfer to the new commission. I would anticipate that when the commission is fully organized the great majority of those in the different purchasing staffs of the various departments will be transferred to the commission. I think it is only a matter of fair dealing that men in the public service should not have their positions cut away by legislation without some effort being made to provide them with suitable positions. Under those conditions I would anticipate that a reduction in the staff would take place when men retired from it or were transferred to some other department of the Government and those vacancies were not filled.

If we had time to go through all the ramifications of all the departments we would find that a whole lot of things had been purchased in supplies of various kinds that would not measure up to the standard. I think that if this proposal were submitted to any group of business men who are accustomed to purchasing any considerable quantity of goods they would say it is the only possible system by which efficiency can be attained. To have purchases distributed broadcast, and to have experts in engineering-for instance, in the Public Works Department-start out to buy dry goods, boots and shoes, or woollen goods, about which they know nothing, is the height of absurdity and could not possibly be carried on in any private business, because a private business is done on a basis that would not permit the waste necessarily involved in such a system.

from any other branch of the public service so far as relates to the desirability of purchasing supplies at the best possible price and on a purely business basis. But the opinion of the War Purchasing Commission, who were requested by the Gov-

ernment to look into and report upon this matter, was that the national railways constituted such a distinct and important branch of the public service and had such an efficient purchasing organization in operation that no public interest would be served by taking it over. The Order in Council of February, 1918, authorized the War Purchasing Commission to make an investigation and report on the matter, and that was the report they made.
I was referring to the purchase of supplies. Last year there was purchased uu-der the direction of the War Purchasing Commission, apart from certain supplies which I shall mention presently, $48,718,537 worth of supplies. In addition, contracts were made for the supply of provisions and other commodities for the military camps and other public services, the contracts being made on a certain basis as to price for the supplies required for two, three or four months as the case might be. The commission has no record of the amounts supplied to the various branches of the public service under these contracts, but the total would be several million dollars. The commission during the past year has handled on the average about 100 distinct transactions a day, or a total of about 30,000 for the year. This gives some idea of the volume of business which has come before the commission and which has beer presonally supervised by the members of the commission.

I do not think it would be right to turn out efficient men who are in the existing departments.
Something has been said about the absence of ministerial responsibility. The commission cannot purchase a dollar's worth of supplies unless they are requisitioned by a minister, and the minister must requisition the precise article he wants. It is not open to the discretion of the commission to buy anything they want. If a two dollar or a fifty dollar basket is required the requisition must definitely call *for it, and if a steel cabinet or a wooden cabinet is required it must be requisitioned for. The very best prices will be obtained and the best business judgment exercised in the purchasing of goods, and this question does not affect the duties of the Auditor General one iota. He will perform his work as faithfully and as fearlessly as ever.

The commissioners divided the work amongst themselves, so that there was no overlapping. I have not, however, the least objection to amending the clause in that way and so leaving it open to the Government to appoint fewer if it is com sidered desirable to do so.
Mr. PETER McGdBBON: Following up that suggestion, I should like to ask the minister if he does not think it would be better, and feasible, to have only one commissioner.

One would suppose that ""included in the Estimates"" would mean the regular Estimates where provision is made for furnishing the necessary moneys but the use of the word ""requisitions"" takes away that meaning.
Mr. [ROWELL: I would draw my hon. friend's attention to two sections which deal with requisitions and supplies respectively. He will see that section 12 provides for a written requisition. That contemplates a specific requisition for the actual supplies that may be required at any time. But the Government holds the opinion, upon the advice of the existing commission, that purchases may be made with great advantage if supplies, say for three months or for six months, are purchased instead of small supplies such as a department might requisition for a month or two, and also that it might be a great advantage to have the . supplies of certain given commodities for all the departments made at the same time. Therefore, section 13 requires that all of the departments shall send in an estimate of the supplies they will probably require for such period or periods of time as the regulation may prescribe. The regulations may require each.department to give an estimate of 'the supplies it will require for six months, or whatever period of time may be determined as being best from the point of securing the goods at the lowest price. If a department puts in an estimate then the commission may purchase on the basis of that estimate, or, if it puts in a specific requisition, the commission may purchase on the basis of that requisition. That is the reason -why these two words are used in this clause.

That accounts for the fact that in introducing the Bill I did so with a few brief observations. I believe I am right in supposing that it is because the members of the House have not had an opportunity of learning the value of the work which

has been done, and the value of the work which will be done by the continuation of
the commission that this discussion has taken place. Therefore, I shall detain the House for a few minutes in dealing with some of the observations which have been made by hon. members in opposition to this Bill. I should have thought that the very clear and forcible statement of the Prime Minister, based on his observation of the work of this commission, which has continuously reported to him during the past four years, would have convinced the House of its value. My hon. friend from Maison-neuve (Mr. Lemieux) has referred to Sir Hormisdas Laporte in very high terms. With everything he has said in regard to that gentleman I am in entire agreement. I know the character of his work on this commission, I know his fine business ability, and with what unselfish public spirit he has served the country. I agree with my hon. friend in saying that Sir Hormisdas Laporte would not advise the Government contrary to the country's interest. I want to say that Sir Hormisdas Laporte will not be on the new commission; he will not accept a position on it. His duties will not permit him to do so. But if there is one thing more than another he has urged upon the attention of the Government, it is that we should make this commission permanent. He speaks out of the knowledge and experience gained during the past four years, from what he knows of the purchasing methods in all the departments of the Government, from what he knows of the purchasing by large business houses like the one with which he is himself connected. It is not a matter of speculation with him. He knows that it will save the public millions of dollars to have this commission established. If there is one thing that he wishes to see before he retires from office after four years of service, without receiving a dollar of remuneration for the splendid work which he has performed, it is the perpetuation of this commission for the benefit of the people of 'Canada.
What is true of Sir Hormisdas Laporte is equally true of every other member of the commission. In one of the last conversations I had with the late Mr. Gundy, one of the ablest business men from my own province, who had served his country without any compensation and who would not have accepted a position oh the permanent commission because he was compelled to return, as he thought, to resume his business duties in Toronto, he said: "" In my judgment the Government would 
be doing a great thing in the interest of efficiency in the management of public affairs and in the saving of public money by making this commission permanent."" He urged the value of the work of this commission and the great importance in the public interest of making it permanent. As a business man he considered the establishment of this permanent commission as one of the most important achievements of any Government. What is true of Sir Hormisdas Laporte and Mr. Gundy is equally true of Mr. Galt. He joined in the recommendation whidh the Prime Minister read to the House this afternoon urging the Government to continue the commission.
My hon. friend from Maisonneuve said that there was no better business man in Quebec than Sir Hormisdas Laporte. Why should one of the foremost business men of Quebec, Sir Hormisdas Laporte, why should one of the foremost business men of Ontario, Mr. Gundy, why should one of the foremost business men of Manitoba, Mr. Galt, after years of investigation and experience in this wofik, unite in making such a recommendation to the Prime Minister if it was not that, as business men, they believed it was in the public interest to do so and that it would mean the saving of millions of dollars to Canada? Otherwise they [DOT]would never have thought of making such a recommendation. The adoption of this method of purchasing supplies during the war meant that we abolished party patronage in the purchase of millions of dollars' worth of supplies. Does any member of the House, now that the war is over, want to see a revival of that old system of patronage in the purchasing of supplies? The hon. member forMaisonneuve said that if patronage had not been abolished there must be on this side of the House some members of the society of Ananias. Party patronage was abolished in the purchase of supplies by the appointment of the War Purchasing Commission. Bring this commission to an end and in the purchase of supplies for all the departments of the Government party patronage will be restored. This Bill is to continue the work of this commission so that party patronage shall be abolished in the purchase of all supplies.
Let me read to the House what the Prime Minister said upon this subject at the opening of the last Parliament:
In addition, we have given our attention to
abolishing patronage absolutely in respect of

all purchases. Hon. gentlemen who were members of this House in the last Parliament will reoollect that in the spring of 1915 the War Purchasing Commission was established for the purpose of contnoling the purchase of all articles required by the Government for the purposes of war. It has done good work and given excellent service; the gentlemen who compose it have given their services freely and voluntarily as a patriotic duty. We have passed an Order in Council that not only war purchases but purchases of all articles, commodities or materials required by the Government shall be made through the War Purchasing Commission and hy tender and contract.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier:	Who are the members
of this commission?
Sir Robert Borden:	Hon. H. Laporte, of
Montreal, chairman; Mr. Gault, of Winnipeg, and Mr. Gundy, of Toronto. On the retirement of Sir Edward Kemp from the 'board when he went overseas, Mr. Eaporte was appointed chairman, and Mr. Gundy became the third member of the board.
That statement by the Prime Minister, made at the opening of the session a year ago, was to implement the pledge made by the Prime Minister when the Union Government went to the country in the general election in the fall <jf 1917.
I had the privilege of speaking with the Prime Minister in the province of Ontario at a number of meetings. I do not know what he said elsewhere, but I know what he said in Ontario, and according to my best recollection there was not a meeting at which he spoke where he did not point out to the electors that the policy of the Government was to abolish party patronage, not only by appointments to the public service by extending the scope of the Civil [DOT]Service Commission, but. also in the purchase of all war supplies by enlarging the powers of the War Purchasing Commission, and to make the work permanent. On every platform on which I heard the Prime Minister speak he .made that pledge to the country, and I know with what enthusiasm it was received by the people. I want to say to my hon. friends on both sides of the House, much as some of them might and db prefer the old system of party patronage in which political influence undoubtedly affects purchases in the departments of the Government, that I have been sufficiently in touch with the political life of the country for the past twenty years to know that prior to the establishment of the War Purchasing Commission political influence played a large part in the purchase of supplies in connection with the Government. The people of this country are heartily sick of that kind of thing, and they responded most cordially to the Prime Minister's announcement of policy in this matter.

The telegram is to the effect that the Government knew the men belonged to this organization, with a provision that they could go out on strike. Now the men are shut out because they went on strike.

I do that more sincerely because I regret to add that his speech did not succeed in removing some distrust which 1 have of this legislation. Indeed, some of the facts to which he referred rather increased than allayed that distrust. He made some references and gave us copious figures regarding certain purchases which we made in war time that would have been a good justification of this legislation in war time, but I understand that the object of the Bill is to perpetuate in times of peace the machinery which was found necessary during the war.
In my opinion, one of the most fundamental principles which the Government need to observe, if they are going to be a successful Government now, is to make as rapid a transition in their thought from war time to peace time as is consistent with the situation. There are a good many things we had to do in war time which I think we shall be glad to discontinue, and be compelled to discontinue, in times of peace.
My hon. friend for Brant referred to the great success this commission had had in purchasing salmon, but I do not apprehend that the Government of Canada are going to be perpetually in the fish-dealing 'business. They had to purchase the salmon,

I presume, to feed the men at the front, and the same remarks apply to a great many of the other figures which my hon. friend gave. That was all right for a Government in war time, but I have, I repeat, very grave distrust of continuing that system in time of peace. The creation of this commission seems to be the shifting of governmental responsibility. We have been a country in Canada for some time now, and the various departments of the Government have had their experts making purchases for their departments., Their duties would be to study the needs of their own particular department, and if they were connected with the department and studied its needs it would appear to me on the surface, at any rate, that they would be better qualified for purchasing ifor that department than a commission would which had surveillance of all the departments of the Government. Furthermore, I think the creation of this commission will be associated with an increase in expense. I do not know what the minister's view would be on that point, but if he would assure me that it would lessen the expense he would remove one of my objections, and no doubt score a point in favour of this legislation.

His belief-because it is only a matter of faith with him; he has told me he believes it would reduce the expense- partakes of the nature of a prophecy, and as I have said before, the only thing you can do with a prophet is to disbelieve him, especially when he prophesies something that is contrary to one's own experience. I have very grave doubts that it would not increase the expense. It certainly increases the machinery of government, and if my hon. friend can increase the machinery of government and reduce the expense he will certainly be something of a miracle worker, because our universal experience is that with an increase in the machinery there inevitably follows an increase in the

expense of government. These are the reasons why -1 do not accept the belief of my hon. friend on the subject. I have very grave doubts about this being a departure for the better, and I shall be glad if	those doubts	can be removed.

NICHOLSON (Algoma): With the details of this Bill I shall not presume to deal at this stage, but dealing with the principle underlying the Bill, if I understand it correctly, it means the employment by the Government of a competent pur-

chasing agent or agents. I do not see how any one having any business experience can disagree. Any ordinary business man, or small firm that is purchasing goods up to $100,000, without going into the millions, will find it to their advantage to pay a salary to a man who understands how to purchase, who knows where to get the right kind of goods, as has been pointed out by the hon. member for Brandon (Mr. Whid-den), and who knows what the goods are when he sees them. How does any large corporation, such as a departmental store, for example, do its purchasing? Does it leave it to the head of each department or employ an expert thoroughly conversant with the whole question of buying?

I ask hon. members to recall public criticism in the press and in Parliament, by the Opposition, in reference to the purchase of supplies, while the Liberal Government was in power, and, when the Conservative Government was in power, by the Liberal Opposition. Prior to the appointment of this War Purchasing Commission, in the press and throughout the country there was public criticism of middlemen who stepped in and got a rake-off and commissions. Who has heard that criticism in the past two or three years? It has ceased to exist. The business men of Canada have absolute confidence in the impartiality and fair dealing which the War Purchasing Commission has given them. They are satisfied that they have been given a square deal and that there is no discrimination, and for these reasons I submit that it is greatly in the public interest that the commission should be continued.
My hon. friend from Red Deer (Mr. Clark) inquired with regard to expenditures. He was not able to accept my estimate for the time being without some proof. In the different departments of the Government there are at present probably no fewer than three hundred officials engaged in connection with the purchasing,- inspection and acceptance of supplies for the Government, and the opinion of the War Purchasing Commission is that by consolidating all the work under one single purchasing commission there will be a substantial saving from the mere standpoint of the number of officials employed to do the work. There will be a saving by reason of the greater efficiency in purchasing.



If only one per cent is saved in handling business to the extent of $40,000,000 per year, it would represent an economy of $400,000 per year.

There are one or two other points I desire to make clear. The ministers must requisition for the supplies they need. Parliament must vote the money for every dollar that is spent; not a dollar of expenditure is taken away from ^Parliament. The War Purchasing Commission does what the Central Purchasing Branch of the Canadian Pacific railway does. It purchases, inspects and accepts goods, but the department must requisition for them and pay for them. The department must be responsible for the purchases, and for these reasons I submit that the Bill is greatly in the national interests and is the fulfilment of the. pledge made by the Prime Minister when the Union Government went to the country in the year 1917.

I think, however, there is one obvious interpretation of them. He has been trying to argue himself into the belief that he did not put his party in an entirely false position when he opposed this Bill. He has introduced many other subjects into the discussion of this clause; I shall not follow him in them all. As to the Civil Service, that can be discussed when we reach the Bill dealing with that matter. I shall not follow him on the Military Service Act; it is not germane to the present discussion, but I may say at least that the statement he made, is, of course, quite without foundation. But coming to the subject under discussion, I say to my hon. friend that there is no political patronage in connection with the purchases made by this commission. If he thinks there is, he has the opportunity of endeavouring to establish that belief before the Public Accounts Committee. If the name of any man producing any particular line of goods is furnished to this commission, the commission will ask him to notify them of all the goods that he handles, and he will have exactly the same opportunity to tender as every other person has. The commission has endeavoured to secure the best list that could be secured of men engaged in various lines of industry and dealing in various kinds of commodities, in order that they may receive notification of the supplies which the Government wishes to purchase, and in order that they may put in a tender if they wish to do so.
I am quite sure my hon. friend has not taken to heart what the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) said with reference to the chairman of the commission, Sir Hormisdas Laporte, or Mr. Gundy, or Mr. Galt. Those men have not lent themselves to political party patronage, but they have carried on the business in an honesit, straightforward way.

I venture to think that if hon. gentlemen opposite were free from party entanglements and obligations, this Bill would never go through the House. Some of the very best men sitting behind the minister have spoken against the Bill, saying that the commission was not necessary and that it involved a further expense when every dollar should be carefully conserved.
We have at present a committee of members of this House inquiring as to where we can cut down the Civil Service. They say that everything is overlapping; thait we have ten to every one that we require in the Civil Service. Those are the statements that are made. I do not know whether they are true or not. We have also a commission to which we have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to find out where we could weed out and cut down the Civil Service. In the midst of all this the minister comes here to create a new department in which at the first flash he is to put 300 men for whom he is creating a home. He admits there is no work for them, because

he says this commission is _ being created for the purpose of cutting down work. Then he is appointing a director over them, and there is no telling how many are to be added to this new department of the Civil Service. Yet I am to be told by the President of the Council that I am afraid of my own action and the action of the Opposition in this House because we are opposed to the creation of a new department and the further involving of the people of this country in the unnecessary expenditure of millions of dollars year after year. If that is all that I have any reason to be afraid of, or if that is the only mistake I have made in my position as leader, I have very little to fear from the judgment of the people.

I quite understand that cases might arise where it would be obviously the duty of the commission to take the state of the market into consideration. For instance, I remember that when the new Parliament buildings were on the point of being commenced the parliamentary committee appointed to
supervise their erection decided to buy the steel framework of the building in advance because it was hinted to one of the members that the price of steel would go up by several points, as it did. Of course, there was a saving by that purchase. But that was a very extraordinary case that occurred during war time. In normal times the commission, I think-indeed, I am positive of it-should not go beyond the amount provided by Parliament for each of the departments.

I delayed giving any definite statement on the subject until I had had opportunity of conferring with the Minister of Labour (Mr. Robertson.). Immediately on his return from Winnipeg I took the matter up with him and he informed me, as I have already stated in the House, that during the past winter and spring he has had many conferences both with employers and employed, and it was because of the suggestion received by him from the employers on the one hand, and from the employed on the other, that he suggested the appointment by Government of the Industrial Commission which is now engaged in investigating these questions in different parts of Canada. Suggestions both as to the scope of the commission and as to its personnel were presented to him by the employers and by the employed. He took all those suggestions into consideration, and I think he gave to both employers and employed the representation which they themselves had proposed. That commission will report, I hope, in a few days. It is understood that immediately on their return on the 15th of June they will make a brief report, to be followed at an early date by a fuller report. The Minister of Labour has the view, which I share, that pending the reception of that report and the information which it will afford, it would be unwise to call the general conference proposed.
There is much, however, which commends itself to my judgment in the suggestion for a general conference, and I can assure my hon. friend that immediately the work of that commission has been completed, and the results of their labours cornmunicated to the Government, most attentive consideration, and I am inclined to think favourable consideration will be given to the suggestion contained in the telegram my hon. friend has just read.

I do not purpose to make a speech, but I purpose to offer one or two observations. I am informed not only by merchants who have had dealings with the War Purchasing Commission, but also by purchasing agents of uie different departments, that the operation of this War Purchasing Commission has not been a success.
For example, I am informed that they ask for tenders for certain commodities, returnable on a certain day, but that they do not order the goods until three or four months afterwards. That is to say, no time is stated within which the goods must be delivered if the tender is accepted. The result is that it is impossible for intending tenderers to give the better price, because they do not know the date of delivery, and for that reason the War Purchasing Commission has been paying much larger prices for goods than would be paid if the

purchasing was done upon a more businesslike basis. In fact, I am told that the business of the War Purchasing Commission has been managed by one or two clerks, and that business men who have dealings with them find the commission very unsatisfactory as to prices, date of delivery, and general quantities required. On the other hand, I am informed by purchasing agents of the departments-perhaps more or less in confidence-that they were able to purchase more advantageously for the Government when they purchased solely for their own departments; that they got better delivery and better prices, and that the goods were superior. I am also informed that local purchasing is practically cut out; that the War Purchasing Commission have been buying largely in the United States and that they refuse to recognize local agents for the supplying of goods manufactured in the United States. The result is that a large number of mercantile agents have been unable to do business with this commission. I bring these matters to the attention of the House because 3D think that before we embark upon a scheme which means a large expenditure of public money in the payment of large salaries to members of this commission and its staff, we should investigate the matter more carefully and see whether the system is any improvement over the one that was in vogue prior to the creation of the War Purchasing Commission.

You will agree that this is one of the most important subjects from the business standpoint that has been brought before the House this session. I think we should concern ourselves more about the soundness of the principles which underlie this Bill than about the question whether some of the details in connection with the manner in which we have been purchasing recently are an improvement on the methods of the pa*t.
We are departing, by this Bill, from the procedure that has been adopted by the War Purchasing Commission, in that a new organization is being set up. We are combining in one department the experts and others who have been looking after the purchasing in the different departments, in order that these specialists may devote their attention and abilities to work which will benefit all departments. Let me illustrate.

During the fiscal year ended March 31,'1919, provisions were purchased in fifteen departments, dry goods in sixteen, hardware in eighteen, mechanical goods in eighteen, drugs, chemicals and scientific articles in sixteen. This Bill proposes that men shall be engaged as specialists in these different branches of purchasing. One man, for instance, will be an expert on groceries and provisions. It will be his duty to
4 p.m. study the markets, to know the goods, to find out when it will be most favourable for those who are able to tender to supply the goods to the Government. He will select articles as standards that are most generally used, in order to permit a larger number to submit tenders fbr the supplying of those goods.
Another thing we should consider is that the goods themselves must be carefully inspected; tests and analyses of certain articles will be necessary. This commission can better employ these experts and get much better general results in that respect. I know of an instance where a manufacturer was asked to tender for a certain article. He tendered at a wholesale price to the War Purchasing Department, but they purchased the goods from a jobber at a higher price. Now, the Purchasing Department were led to believe that the goods they were purchasing represented better value than those which the manufacturer in question offered to supply; but it turned out that the goods were the same as those bid on by the manufacturer. I do not blame the War Purchasing Commission for that, but under the new system that difficulty would be overcome.

whole debate, and I have very grave doubts as to the advisability of the House passing this measure. Of course, I do not pretend to discuss the relative merits of the gentlemen who were, and, indeed, still are, the members of the War Purchasing Commission. I do not know these gentlemen except Sir Hormisdas Laporte, who is one of the most distinguished citizens of my province and enjoys the very highest reputation both as a business man and as a faithful administrator. But that is not the point at issue. I believe in the old saying, which, indeed, is more than a saying because it is found in the Holy Book, that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. I believe that every man exercising a responsible function coming within the bounds of the constitution should be amenable to Parliament; but I shall discuss that point a little later on. For the present I simply wish to say this: The war is over. It is true that yesterday the Minister of Finance said that as regards the necessities and 
requirements of 'the financial year this should properly be called a war year. I do not deny that at all, but the war is at an end, and the extraordinary proceedings bordering on unconstitutionality which took place during the war and which were criticised and challenged by His Majesty's loyal Opposition should now be discarded. The Canadian people have submitted themselves during those fouir eventful years to what I would call autocratic rule. Although a Liberal, and inclined to be - radical, I admit that the peculiar conditions existing not only in Canada but throughout the whole civilized world justified to a certain extent some of the measures which were not enacted, but imposed upon the good-will of the people of Canada. We have been governed by Orders in Council. Parliament has disregarded some of its most sacred and ancient privileges. We have witnessed in this House members of the Government receiving the emoluments of office during nearly one year without having even received a mandate from the people. I protested at the time against such a violation of the British constitution, British precedent and the ancient and time-honoured usages of our own Canadian constitution. The people resented the autocratic methods which the Government thought proper to adopt for the time being, and I warn the Government that the people of Canada to-day are not in a mood to stand for any such breaks in the future. During the war, of course, the Government had a practically free hand in spending the millions which were taken from the public exchequer for the business of the Canadian army and the Government generally. Indeed, it has come to this, that during the last four years the Government has enjoyed the fullest privileges as regards the expenditure of public money. We had yesterday from the hon. the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) a statement which is now before the whole Canadian people. I may be regarded as cheeseparing, but I say that with the financial condition of Canada today as it is the duty of the Government is to put. the brake on the expenditure of public money. On this score alone I say to the Government "" halt."" The amount involved may not be over $50,000 or $60,000, or perhaps $100,000, but I say in all gravity, with a full sense of my responsibility and not for the mere pleasure of digging the Government in the ribs, but as a Canadian, and having regard to the financial standing of Canada, that the Government ought to exercise, the closest control over every dollar of expenditure.

My hon. friend the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowell) is a member of a practically new government. The Government which took office in 1911 and the Union Government by which it was superseded, have created so many commissions since that time that, although an old member of the House, I would be at a loss to give a list of those commissions without speaking by the book. I think it is not going beyond the mark to say that at least forty or fifty commissions have been created since 1911. Each commission was created for the purpose of relieving the members of the Government from some of the work for which, with all due respect, the members of the Government are paid in hard cash by the people-the tax-payers-of Canada.
The financial condition of this country is most alarming. I need not repeat the figures quoted yesterday by the Finance Minister. There must be a beginning in the reduction of public expenditure. We must revert to the old Alexander Mackenzie method of practising economy. Only last evening we heard a minister of the Crown, at the head of one of the most important and responsible departments of the Government, namely the Department of Railways and Canals, admitting that in connection with the Trent Valley canal, and the deepening of the Welland canal, the expenditure was practically useless, but, as he said, we must give employment to the returned soldiers of those districts. When he was put to the test, and asked by my hon. friend from Antigonish and Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair), and by my hon. friend the leader of the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie), how many returned soldiers were employed on the Trent Valley canal, and on the deepening of the Welland cdnal, he said there were about 200 employed, although the money to be expended will reach a total of over $4,000,000 in both instances.
There is grave unrest in the country and the people will not stand very long for the wild expenditures that are being made on the most flimsy pretexts. Now, let us come to this new commission. Is it necessary? I have the greatest respect for the opinion of my right hon. friend the leader of the Government (Sir Robert Borden), but, with his experience as a parliamentarian and a minister of the Crown, is it necessary that the War Purchasing Commission which has ended its business, honourably, creditably-I frankly admit-should be continued in operation? Is it necessary that we should now embalm in the statute books legislation which makes of a temporary
commission created for a special purpose, namely, war purchases, a permanent one?
With all due respect to the Prime Minister of Canada, I say it is not going beyond the mark to say the contrary. It is not necessary to make that commission permanent. Having ended its business- the purchase of supplies during the war- it is unnecessary, now, that we are reverting to the old lines of business, to add this new burden on the shoulders of the taxpayers. I do not know exactly what this new commission will cost the Treasury, but I believe I am not far astray when I say that it will entail an expenditure of nearly $100,000 at least. I am told that an army of secretaries, typists and bookkeepers were employed during the war, and possibly during that eventful period it was proper to have that organization. The purchases were enormous in size and the amounts involved were very large, and it was proper, I repeat, that during that period a special commission should have been created in order to protect the public treasury. But, now that the war is over, the commission has ended its business. I feed confident that it has handled this business creditably and honourably, and speaking from what I know, I state most positively that a man of Sir Hormis-das Laporte's standing in the community would not give the commission anything but the best advice, and the people of the country anything but the best service. We are. however, reverting to pre-war conditions as regards the administration of each department of the Government. I was a member of government for eight years, during five of which I was directlyresponsible,with my colleagues of the Laurier Administration, to Parliament. I know that a minister of the Crown who is simply honest and is endowed with some business ability can manage his department by taking, of course, the necessary safeguards and by exercising the necessary checks upon the expenditure which comes under his eyes every day. I had one of the large spending departments to administer, namely, the Post Office Department. I know that the expenditure of such a department can be honestly supervised with the best results. A requisition is sent to the proper officer from whom it must come before the deputy minister, who is the first officer of the department, and from the deputy minister it goes before the minister. Every requisition must pass through several channels, and a minister of the Crown, if he is honest and knows his business, will be sur-

rounded by good' officials whom he will trust. Have not we reformed our Civil Service? Have not we increased the salaries ol the deputy ministers and given them, so to speak, a more extended authority to protect the public exchequer against the raids that might be made from outside? And, Mr. Speaker, have not we abolished the patronage system? If we have, not abolished it, then, Sir, some of the hon. gentlemen opposite belong to the tribe of Ananias, because we have been repeatedly informed in this House, day in and day out, that patronage had been abolished in every department of government. If patronage no longer prevails, if the system of public tender is followed in each department, what need is there to create this new commission, and for what purpose have - e this year increased the salaries of deputy ministers? Their salaries were increased first from $4,000 to $5,000, and now from $5,000 to $6,000 a year. Are they going to be deprived of all authority? What is their business if not to administer their departments and to see that expenditures are honestly made and procedure honestly carried out? I say that there are checks and safeguards at every step in each department if the deputy does his duty and if the minister in charge will simply live up to the statute defining his powers in his own department. My hon. friend, the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowell) belongs, as I do, to the legal fraternity, and I believe that he has a keen business intellect. Will he tell me that in his own department, and sticking to his business-of course, if he is lost in Imperialistic dreams, that is another matter-he could not keep a vigilant' scrutiny on ""expenditures? Now that the war is over and peace is going to be signed, let us come to essentials, let us get down to elementals-in popular language, let us get down to brass tacks. We are no longer at war. The Peace Treaty will be signed in a short while and we shall resume the even tenor of our way, constitutionally speaking. Canada is Canada. There is no revolution from a constitutional point of view. There is some unrest in the country, but it is against the Government, and the profiteers, not against the constitution. We are resuming our duties as in pre-war times, and I would urge my hon. friend to come down from the high heaven of his dreams to solid earth. Let him tackle the business of his department. Although /I do not share his views politically, I know he has enough business acumen to direct the affairs committed to his charge in conformity with the statute. What is the use
[Mr. I.emieux. 1
of that Bill? Has my, hon. friend read the statutory powers of each department? If he has, he will find that in each department there are checks and safeguards; and above all there is in the Government of Canada an officer who is the watch dog of the treasury and who officially is known as the Auditor General of Canada.
Do you beiieve, Mr. Speaker, for one moment that old Lome Macdougall, that John Fraser, that the present Auditor Genera]- whom I have not the pleasure of knowing, but who is an honest and sturdy officer of the Crown-might have been or would be in need of a commission to curtail expenditure, to see that the law as regards public tenders was followed? What are the duties of the Auditor General if not to call the attention of every minister of the Crown, when he has overstepped the mark, to the fact that he has not confined himself within the powers conferred upon him by the laws of Canada? When I was in the Government, Mr. Speaker, my nightmare was the Auditor General. I was afraid every year-

' ently overlooks the fact that we already have in the several departments approximately 300 employees engaged in this work. The task of purchasing the various classes of supplies required by all the departments is an enormous one. After those supplies are purchased, they must be inspected. The officials must see that all the supplies purchased are in accordance with [DOT]specification; that they are up to standard in quality and quantity. Then they must [DOT]accept. The officials are responsible for those three things, purchasing, inspecting and accepting, and that is a very large undertaking when not less than $40,000,000 worth of goods of all kinds are being purchased in all sections of the country. I do not think we would be justified in cutting down the number further than we have. This leaves it open to the Government to review the whole situation and decide what is most advantageous.
Mr. PETER McGIBBiON:	I can quite
understand the hon. minister's object if he is going to make these commissioners inspect everything and be an authority on everything. They will have to have proper inspectors, no doubt, to see that the quality and the standard of these goods are right. I cannot conceive of three commissioners being so qualified on everything that they can pass judgment after having inspected every line of goods this Government is going to buy. That work they will have to delegate to proper inspectors. Taking that into consideration, I do not see why it is necessary to have three commissioners.

Mr. ROWEiLL: I would think his work would correspond largely with what is now being done by the secretary of the War Purchasing 'Commission, who has charge of the office operations and the general direction of the staff, under the commissioners, of - course. That is really what is contemplated. He might be called the secretary of the commission instead of the director. At present he is named the secretary of the commission. The present commission suggested that he be called a director, but if any hon. member thinks there is anything in the name I have no objection to changing it to "" secretary.""

SINCLAIR:,,PURCHASING OF DEPARTMENTAL AND OTHER SUPPLIES.,,,"But if they indicate in the requisitions the firms that the purchasing agents go to for their supplies, that is going back to the old patronage lists. It came out in an examination in .one of the committees the other day that the departments sent advertising for newspapers to the officer in the King's Printer's department whose duty it is to look after Government advertising, and that with that advertisement was sent a list of the newspapers in which it was to be inserted. These newspapers were selected to suit the minister, and it was simply perpetuating the old patronage system. The officer produced a number of newspapers containing a certain advertisement and they all happened to be of one stripe of politics. We asked if this was not a patronage list, and this officer denied that it was. He said: ""We have no patronage lists."" ""What do you call it then?"" he was asked. He said ""I call it a selection."" That was his new name for it, but it was the same old thing we used to call a patronage list. In sending out this requisition would it be competent for the officers of the department to send a list of the firms to whom the purchasing agent must go to purchase the goods?

happen. The Commission and all its employees may pass away but the Civil Service Act of last year provided that appointments to commissions of a temporary character must be made by the Civil Service Commission. Some of the war commissions, in selecting their staffs, paid higher salaries than were given the members of the staffs of the several departments of Government. The result was an obvious discrimination between those regularly in the service and those who were taken on by these commissions. It naturally caused a great deal of dissatisfaction on the part of those in the Civil Service and a great deal of embarrassment and annoyance to the permanent departments of the Government because the persons employed by these commissions were being paid on a different basis from the others entirely. They had the very same trouble in the United States during the war only they had it in a more aggravated form than we had. It was for that reason that the Civil Service Commission was

given jurisdiction over appointments to the staffs of these commissions.

says may be quite true as a matter of law, but he will see that the old commission does not go out of existence until the new one is created. The object is to continue the work which has hitherto been carried on by the other commission. The other commission, carrying it on during the past four years, has inevitably secured a number of employees who have developed a high degree of efficiency and skill in this work and in supervising the work of all the departments of Government. They have a general knowledge of all the departments which the employees in any one department, no matter how efficient they may be, have not. While these men have no claim to be transferred, yet in the public interest, having regard to the necessity of carrying on the work efficiently, the Government deems it desirable that there should be some provision whereby those possessing this ability can be transferred. That is the object of subsection 2. It does not follow that all will be transferred; it only follows that those whom the new commission may desire, and the Civil 'Service Commission recommend, will be transferred in order that the work of the new commission may be as efficient as possible.

bound to dispense with their services. Why make an exception of this particular service and make the employees permanent when hundreds are being turned off in other places? They should all be treated alike and be called upon to make a new application. If they pass there can be no complaint, but you are going to transfer every one in this War Purchasing Commission to a new permanent department. After you have done that, you will find in the Militia Department, say, about twenty or thirty or forty men out of employment because their work is finished. Will they be transferred to some other department without an examination? They came in without an examination and now that their work is finished they are to be turned off. If the principle that the minister is establishing here is to be applied, these men will argue that as 'permanent places have been found in this new department for fifty or a hundred men, or whatever may be the number, it is unfair to turn them on the street. What sort of fair play is there in that? If the policy , were adopted that every one who comes into the new department should enter ab initio under the Civil Service Commission no fault could be found as there would be no favouritism or preference. What I object to is that the minister should take this particular group of employees and make them permanent without complying with the Civil Service Act.

I am taking the liberty of drawing to your attention that the Government are pasing a Bill at the present time to renew the War Service Purchasing Committee.

that the War 'Service Purchasing Committee which is just expiring has not altogether been a success as the buying has been done by amateurs, and the consequence is that at the present time the Government is loaded up with materials, etc., bought at very high prices for which they have no use. Perhaps this matter might be worth sifting out.

supplies in the hands of the Government very material? What does the minister say with reference to this statement that there is evidence of amateurishness in the purchase of supplies?

On the other hand, it is suggested that we are not giving them power enough. This is the view underlying the Bill. The department must take the responsibility for the quantity and the general character of the goods it desires to have purchased. The minister of the department is responsible to Parliament. He must requisition the supply, and must finally pay the account; he must ask Parliament to vote the money. As the law now stands, he can go out and buy the supplies, but. when this commission is appointed he will have to make a requisition to the commission. If the commission had the power to change the requisition of. their own motion the minister might come to Parliament and say, "" I have no responsibility."" We do not think it is desirable that he should have that escape or that the commission should exercise that power. If the commission is satisfied that the requisition is not wise they report direct to the minister to whom they are responsible. They lay the facts before the

Prime Minister, that a certain department is asking for too much or for something that is not in the public interest. It appears to me that this provision maintains ministerial responsibility and ensures the best results in the purchase of supplies.

do not intend to delay the House long by any remarks of mine, and in that way I shall gain the approval of the minister who has just taken his seat (Mr. Burrell). I always listen to him with attention when he speaks, and generally when he replies to remarks from this side of the House his words are a complaint as to the length of the speeches made by us. I wish very frankly and courteously to tell the minister and the House that we on this side intend to take just as long on any subject matter of interest to the country as we think proper, subject, always, to the gag which the majority can place upon us if they desire to do so.
The minister has stated that the argument of the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) was not a businesslike argument. He says that the proposal to appoint this commission is a businesslike suggestion, and that whatthisBill proposes to do, namely, to put the purchasing of all Government requirements into the hands of what practically amounts to an irresponsible commission, is something which all large businesses do by centralizing their purchasing activities. I grant that it is of advantage to have the purchasing centralized, but I say that in order to do that, it is not necessary for Parliament to abdicate its power and its responsibility. Suppose the Canadian Pacific directorate appointed a small purchasing committee. Suppose that small committee spent lavishly the money belonging to the Railway Company. Suppose that at an annual meeting a shareholder said to the Chairman of the Canadian Pacific ""You are spending too much on this, that or the other thing."" What would the minister think if the Chairman of the Canadian Pacific said: ""We have appointed a committee which is only removable in a very difficult fashion every ten years. Therefore, do not blame the directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway for this extravagance, because it is the fault of the committee which you and I appointed at the last meeting."" Does the minister think that that answer would satisfy the shareholders of the Canadian Pacific? It would not satisfy them for a moment. There is no man in this House

who desires to see patronage eliminated more than I do. Patronage has. been the curse of politics in this and other countries. It is what induced some people to call politics ""une sale cuisine,"" or a dirty business. But it is not necessary, I respectfully submit, to appoint a commission of this sort to get over the difficulty. There are purchasing agents in every department, and one way to get over the difficulty would be for these purchasing representatives of every department to have an association whereby they would communicate the necessities of their several departments to one another and see that one was never bidding against the other in buying supplies, or if it is necessary to go still further -and my experience of public matters is not sufficient to enable me to state whether it is or not-a purchasing department might be formed composed of well-paid and intelligent civil servants, and presided over by the minister, who will be responsible to this House for what that purchasing department does.
"" TheTninistex-said- thatministeriah^-espem-sibility would not be affected. I am sure the minister is frank and fair in his mind, and I put this proposal to him: Let us suppose that he wished to have a waste paper basket for his office as Secretary of State, and he requisitioned one. This commission, with large ideas, and believing that ministers from the West desire expensive waste paper baskets, went out and bought, we will suppose, a mahogany waste paper basket for about $40, as was done for- one of the ministers from Saskatchewan the other day. Now the minister says, "" I would be responsible for that purchase."" He would not be responsible. He would be responsible for asking for a waste paper basket, and responsible that a waste paper basket was bought, but he would not be responsible for the price paid for that basket, because if he was attacked for buying a trifling waste paper basket for $40 he would hold up his hands and say: ""I come from a country where such extravagance is regarded as disgusting, and the responsibility for buying that $40 waste paper basket rests on the shoulders of the independent commission appointed by this House. If you feel that this waste paper basket matter is of sufficient importance, then if a joint petition of the House and the Senate is carried in both Chambers we can remove the commissioners from office."" No, the responsibility of asking for the goods will be on the minister, I frankly grant, but the responsibility for the price paid for the goods will be upon the commission and not upon the minister.
What does this mean? This Bill is just a reflection of what governments have been doing in this and other countries. Administrations have got rather tired of ordinary members of Parliament; they are in the way, and things cannot be done as quickly as they could be done if ministers could only have their own sweet will. In Great Britain commissions have been formed ad libitum. They have been created in large numbers in this country, and one of the duties that falls upon the representatives of the people in this and other countries is to see that the House of Parliament resumes its functions, that it shall no longer be a rubber stamp for what the ministers desire to do.
In one sense that is not the great question. In another sense it goes to the very root of the matter. Are the ministers desirous of avoiding responsibility? In the days gone by heirs to thrones and princes must not have their teachers' hands laid upon them. They had "" whipping boys "", and if the young prince did not know his lessons the-""-""whipping boy-^-got-tho flogging.-If ministers do wrong when purchases are made, if improper prices are paid for the supplies which are bought, what will the ministers say? They will say: ""Turn to the whipping boy, turn to the commission; it is not our fault.""

The situation so far as the postal employees are concerned, whether at Winnipeg or elsewhere, is very simple. In. Winnipeg they went out on a sympathetic strike although they had no grievance of their own and they were given a period of between two and three days within which to return to their duty. They were distinctly and emphatically informed that if they did not [Sir Robert Rorden.j
return to their duty by Monday noon, the 26th of May, they must regard themselves as permanently retired from the public service. I understand that a very considerable number of them were disposed to return, and seventy of them did return. The others were deterred, I understand, by the assertion made to them by interested people that the Government was ""bluffing"" and would not dare to carry out its proposal in regard to the men who had thus deserted their duty in the public service. A very distinct intimation was sent by telegram to Calgary, to Edmonton, and to every other western city in which strikes had not then taken place, but where there seemed a possibility that the employees in the public service would go out on a sympathetic strike. That telegram has already been communicated to the House, and will be found at page 2957 of the unrevised Hansard of the 27th of May, 1919. *L need not read it again.	*
It was a distinct and emphatic intimation to the postal employees that if they undertook to go out on a sympathetic strike, disregard their public duty, accept the direction of another authority than the Government, dislocate the public service of this country, and occasion widespread public inconvenience, they must regard themselves as permanently retired from the public service of this country.
I have had a great many communications on the subject since, and I have sent replies. I do not think it is worth while reading them to the House, but I am perfectly prepared to do so at any time if my hon. friend so desires. I can only say that the Government, having taken this position, and taken it, I think, with good cause, would render no good service to the public interest by withdrawing from it. There was the most plain and positive intimation to all these employees as to the result of the course which they proposed to take, and having given that warning I do not think they are at liberty to blame the Government of this country. They have no one to blame but themselves and those who induced them to engage in this sympathetic strike. I greatly regret that they find themselves in their present position.

I did not show it to the Prime Minister, as I thought the Acting Minister of Trade and Commerce would be present, but he is not in his seat just now.

out local buying but simply provides that purchases shall be made by this commission. The question of where purchases should be made is a matter with which the commission deals. Provision is made in the Bill, as is necessary, that certain supplies may be purchased by the departments in small quantities or in case of emergency, which might arise in any section of the country. Just as in every well organized business where there is a central purchasing department, there must be a certain amount of latitude given to officials on the ground in the making of small or (emergency purchases, so provision is made ffor such purchases in this Bill. The Bill provides for the appointment of three commissioners to hold office for a period of ten years, and they shall cease to hold office on reaching the age of 70 years. A3 I have already intimated, the salaries are left blank, and that clause must stand
iMr. Rowell.]
until the resolution is submitted to the committee authorizing this expenditure. The main clause of the Bill defining the powers of the commission is section 6, which reads:
(1) The commission shall have the exclusive power and right to purchase, contract for, inspect and accept supplies for the public service. Provided, however, that the commission, when it deems it advisable, may, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulation or by the commission, authorize any portion of the public service to purchase, contract for, inspect or accept supplies.
Members will see that the commission can make no purchase except upon requisition of the various departments. Under section 12 the departments must present requisitions showing the kind and quantity of supplies they require. The commission have no authority to change any such requisition, but if they feel that the requisition is not one which they should comply with or that for any other reason the attention of the Government should be drawn to it, they may communicate to the Prime Minister their observations on that requisition for such action as the Government may see fit to take in the premises.
Section 13, it will be seen, provides that estimates of the supplies required shall he made on or before such dates as may be prescribed by regulation and sent to the, commission. This will enable the commission to purchase at one time for several departments and in large quantities.
Section 16 requires that the purchases shall be by tender.
Section 17 provides that the commission shall keep full records and make such reports to the Prime Minister as he shall from time to time require.
In brief outline I have set forth the main provisions of the Bill, and I can only close as I opened: The object of the Bill is to secure the benefit of the purchase on a business basis, through one central organization, of all supplies required by the Government for public purposes, wholly free from party patronage or political influence, so that the Government will receive for every dollar expended a dollar's worth in return. Every citizen of Canada is interested in securing this result, and this Bill marks a great step in advance over the pre-war and early-war conditions.

Bill is to continue the work which has been carried on during the greater part of the war period by the War Purchasing Commission. The intention of the Government is to make sure that in future the purchase of all supplies required by the various departments of the Government shall be made through a purchasing commission of business men with tenders called for from the business men of the country and wholly apart from personal or political influences. The members will recall that in May, 1915, an Order in Council was passed creating what was known as the War Purchasing Commission. The Order in Council provides that:
All purchases of clothing, equipment, arms, juns, ammunition, horses, munitions and materials of war and supplies of every kind, and all contracts for such purposes, and all contracts for transportation, payable out of the funds appropriated by the War Appropriation Act, 1915, or out of the funds appropriated by any other Act for the purpose enumerated in the War Appropriation Act, 1915, shall be made by the commission or made under its direction and control, and the commission is hereby empowered on behalf of the Government to make such purchases and to enter into or direct and control the making of such contracts.
Under that Order in Council Sir Edward Kemp, Mr., afterwards Sir, Hormisdas La-porte, and Mr. George Frederick Galt, of Winnipeg, were appointed members of this commission. The commission carried on its work of purchasing all war supplies and all supplies purchased out of the War Appropriation Fund, until the autumn of 1917, without any change in personnel. Sir Edward Kemp, upon being appointed Overseas Minister of Militia, resigned the chairmanship of the War Purchasing Commission and also resigned his membership in it. Sir Hormisdas Laporte was appointed chairman, and

Mr. W. P. Gundy, of Toronto, succeeded Sit Edward Kemp on the commission. The commission as reconstituted conducted its work under this original Order in Council without substantial change until the spring of 1918. In the month of February, 1918, the powers of the commission were enlarged so as to cover the purchasing in all departments of the Government, with the single exception of that of Government railways. An Order in 'Council was passed on the 6th February, 1918. The recital gives the reasons not only for the Order in 'Council, but also for the present legislation, so that I may be permitted to read one or two clauses from it:
And whereas the Prime Minister is of the opinion that the provisions of the above mentioned Orders in Council and the functions of the War Purchasing Commission might with advantage be extended to all purchases by the several departments of the Government for any purpose, whether connected with the prosecution of the war or otherwise, subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth:
And whereas the Prime Minister observes that the establishment of the War Purchasing Commission has resulted in a very great saving of public moneys, 'as well as in the abolition of patronage in respect of purchases for the war and it is important to extend this system as widely as possible, pending consideration of permanent provision for that purpose after fuller study and consideration of the problems involved.
Under the original Order in Council it was provided that purchases should be made by or under the direction and control of the commission. In carrying on the work the commission have acted under the latter part of this clause, viz.: the purchases have been made under the direction and control of the commission, with the results outlined by the Prime Minister in the recital to the Order in Council of February, 1918.
This commission was appointed for the period of the war and the members served in an honorary capacity. They have all given their services to the country without any compensation whatever, and I am sure the, members of the House will feel that the House owes an expression of appreciation to those public-spirited business men for the faithful and efficient service they have given to the country in this important branch of the public service. It is a matter of great regret to the Government, as I am sure it will be to the House, that one oi the members of the commission, Mr. Gundy, of Toronto, died very unexpectedly some ten days ago, while in the service of the country, and the commission has lost the benefit of his valuable services. He was deeply interested in the work of the com-

mission, and gave unstintedly of his splendid business ability in its service. So great was his devotion to his country and to his country's cause in the war, that 1 am sure if he had had the opportunity to choose the circumstances under which he would pass away, he would have chosen to die in the service of the country he loved and while working in the cause which lay so near to his heart.
The Bill provides for the creation of a Central Purchasing Commission under which in future the purchase of all supplies for the Government will be made. As I have pointed out, under the existing Orders in Council purchases were 'made under the direction and control of the commission and each department continued its existing purchasing staff. The commission did not consider it desirable to disturb the existing staffs, as the War Purchasing Commission was of a temporary character, and when it was formed they thought that probably when the war was over pre-war conditions would again prevail. But now that it has been decided to make the War Purchasing Commission a permanent organization, there is no longer any reason for maintaining the existing staffs of all the departments, and the object of the Bill is to centralize the purchasing for all the branches of the Government in one purchasing commission. The members of the House know that all great business concerns of the present day have long since centralized their purchasing in order to obtain the very best results for 'the moneys expended. Some of the benefits that will result from centralized purchasing in such a business body as this will be, first, that instead of purchasing a certain quantity of supplies for one department, this Purchasing Commission will ascertain from all the departments the total quantities of supplies of any given article which they require and will thus be able in one purchase to secure all the articles of any given class which all the branches of the Government may require. In purchasing under these conditions the commission should, and no doubt will, obtain in many cases all the desired supplies at a lower price than would be possible in the purchase of smaller quantities by different departments. There will be an advantage in having a body oi men devoting their whole attention to the business of purchasing Government supplies. Purchasing to-day has become almost a science in the large business concerns of the country. Men of the highest ability are appointed to this responsible task in order that the institutions with
which they are connected may obtain the benefit of their skill and ability. In making purchases in this way the Government will have the benefit of a thoroughly efficient organization. I am sure that members of the House will be interested to know what the total purchases of the Government amount to from year to year. During the past two or three years purchases have, of course, been enormous. Purchasing under normal conditions would not be on as large a scale as during the war years. But it must also be borne in mind that during the war years the purchase of supplies for many departments has been on a very limited scale. Some departments have been keeping the purchase of supplies down to the lowest limit and when normal conditions return the volume of supplies required by these branches of the Government will be substantially larger than the volume required during the period of the war. The estimate of the commission is that the annual purchases for the Government will be not less than $40,000,000. They have been much more than that during the war period.

Under this system the standard of the goods will be set down, samples will have to be submitted, and if the commission does its duty-and I believe it will; if it does not, it is for the House to see that it does-they will see that if goods bid on are claimed to be superior, those goods must be proved to be superior. I think, therefore., that the arguments advanced with regard to certain defects in the purchasing system will really tend to strengthen this Bill in the estimation of the House.
The people are looking to the Government to set an example of efficiency and justice
in the conduct of the business of the country. We are undertaking responsibilities in a business way which we never thought would be necessary. We have undertaken the operation of great railroad systems, and if this Government does not adopt a sound, honest, and efficient policy with regard to such business as the purchasing for the different departments, the country will not have confidence in its ability even to direct, through its officials, the National Railway System
I have had some experience in connection with the organization of just such a department as this. A large business which was organized some twenty years ago and which controls a number of amalgamated factories, saw the advisability of uniting the purchasing branches of the various departments in a central head office. Accordingly, they adopted that system, continued it ever since, and have found it most successful. The point brought out by the President of the Council (Hon. Mr. Rowell) with regard to the desirability of buying in quantities was one of the advantages which commended itself to the firm.
Moreover, the requirements of the different departments are varied, and considerable loss will result to the country unless there is some method of transferring goods from one department to another in the case of there being a surplus stock on hand. It is the duty of this commission to know the stocks of goods in the various departments, and to see that goods are transferred from one department to another if it is to the advantage of the country that that should be done.
This is an opportune time for this ques-* tion to come before the House. Yesterday the Budget was presented by our able Finance Minister (Sir Thomas White) in a masterly way. He advised us to produce and to save; and in adopting, the day following the Budget, a system of purchasing which, in my opinion, will save this country millions of dollars, is establishing a very good object lesson.
I had the privilege a short time ago of calling at the offices of the War Purchasing Commission where I had an interview with Mr. W. P. Gundy and I wish to endorse the words uttered by the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Kowell) with regard to the services of the late Mr. Gundy to Canada and also with regard to the services of the other gentlemen who gave their time untiringly to the work of this commission.

I was tela that when the commission first asked for prices on typewriters, they received from all the companies the same price based upon the price for a quantity of ten. The commission protested against this and said that as the Government was a very large purchaser it v/as entitled to a further discount, and the commission were given a further discount of ten per cent which represents a very substantial saving. I was also informed that in their purchases of Kraft paper which are very large, they were able to buy it at ten per cent less than any one else.
With regard to boots, since the establishment of the War Purchasing Commission in May, 1915, over two and a quarter million pairs of boots have been purchased. When tenders were called in 1918, the boot manufacturers blamed the tanners of leather because prices had advanced so much, and they in turn, blamed trade conditions. By co-operation with the War Trade Board, a fair price for leather was arranged with the tanners; a fair price for boots was then arranged with the makers, and I give the House these figures as an instance of the work of the War Purchasing Commission in this large item which is much more important than some of the smaller ones to which they could not give the same attention. The United States' boots cost $6.45 per pair as against our price of $5.40 for Canadian pattern, and a3 regards British War Office pattern, the United States' price ranged from $7.15 to $9.05 per pair according to size as against our price of $6 for all sizes. That demonstrates that the War Purchasing Commission have done a most useful service to Canada during the past few years.
Purchases amounting to $200,000,000 were made or supervised by this commission, and the work they did must have taxed their time both night and day. From May 4, 1915, to May 31,1918, the commission held 672 sessions, and they passed upon items which were entered on minutes, the minutes of those meetings numbering 22,610. From April 1, 1918, to the third week cf February, 1919, they held 277 sessions, and they passed 15,000 minutes. The increase during the past year was due to the fact that there was placed upon the commission the additional labour of supervising purchases of all other departments of Government.
They were entrusted with making adjust-' ments on $8,000,000 worth of salmon that the Government took over, and they were successful in arranging a satisfactory price

between the canners and the British Food Minister. They were also entrusted with adjusting the cancellations of $8,000,000 worth of orders after the armistice, and they were successful in adjusting these cancellations on a compensation of less than ten per cent. They also had in hand the sale of surplus stores of the Department of Militia and Defence and the Department of the Naval Service. These articles which were left over after the armistice were disposed of by the commission, I believe, in a fair and a reasonable way. The commission also had charge of arranging the rates for the transportation of troops by rail. The first-class rate was arranged at one and one-half cents per mile where there were over 350 troops in the same train or being transported at the same time, and when there were less than 350, the rate was two cents per mile. The commission also arranged for the transportation of officers and men from overseas; the rate for officers averaging $61, and for men $.35.
If any hon. member has any doubt as to the desire of the commission to carry out, in a businesslike, just and fair way, the policy of calling for tenders, he should visit the offices of the War Purchasing Commission and make personal investigations. I had an opportunity of looking over their files in which their tenders were recorded, the books and files showing clearly what each company bid, which tender was accepted and the reason for such acceptance. I have here, without any names, some facts that will demonstrate how this policy was carried out.
For example, this is a purchase of 200 sanitary flat-top desks of a certain adopted pattern. Twenty-four firms were asked to tender; eighteen replied, of whom fourteen quoted, the tenders ranging from $9,900 to $6,300, and the lowest tender was accepted.
This is a purchase of medical supplies. Sixteen firms quoted, the total of the highest tenders was $1,969.50, and the accepted tenders totalled $1,281.
This is a purchase of surgical supplies. Fourteen firms quoted, the total of the highest tender being $2,098.30, and the accepted tenders totalled $765.80.
Of another purchase of medical supplies seventeen tenders were received, the highest bids totalling $4,069.68, and the accepted tenders totalled $2,916.88.
On a purchase of drugs, seventeen tenders were received, the highest bids totalling $7,598.85, and the accepted tenders totalled $5,014.21.

On another purchase of medical supplies, the highest tenders totalled $940.80, and the accepted tenders totalled $611.94.
On a further purchase of medical supplies, the highest tenders totalled $4,046.54, and the accepted tenders totalled $2,701.44.
Those figures should demonstrate to the House the necessity for having this business handled by men who are experts in the different lines, and also of having this business open to the free tender of any *Canadian citizen who thinks he is in a position to bid for the business. I do not see how it is going to be possible for the country to get a proper system of purchasing except by adopting the policy laid down in this Bill. Probably some modifications will have to be- made to the Bill, but I believe the general principles of it are absolutely sound and will commend themselves to the good judgment of the members of the House as well as to the general public. It will give the people of Canada a square deal, and they are certainly entitled to a square deal from the public servants in charge of the country's business.
This is the first occasion on which I have had the honour of addressing you, Sir, and Ufeel it a great privilege to be able to say a few words of congratulation on the Government's action in this respect. I believe this measure will help to demonstrate to the people of Canada that this Government desires to do the right thing in its administration.

Whenever any person other than a Canadian citizen advocates in Canada the overthrow, etc.
Now, a person can do a good many things of this character by other means than advocating. The substituted section reads as follows:
Section fifteen of the Act to amend The Immigration Act passed at the present session of Parliament is repealed, and the following is. substituted therefor:-	.
""41. (1) Every person who by word or act in Canada seeks to overthrow by force or violence the government of or constituted law and authority in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland or of Canada, or of any of the provinces of Canada, or the government of any other of His Majesty's dominions, colonies, possessions or dependencies, or who in Canada defends or suggests the unlawful destruction of property-
That is new. That is one who advocates or suggests the unlawful destruction of property.
.-or by word or act creates or attempts to create any riot or public disorder in Canada, or who without lawful authority assumes any powers of government in Canada

That is new. That is any person who assumes any authority without lawful justification.
-assumes any powers of government in Canada or in any part thereof, or who by common repute belongs to or is suspected of belonging to any secret society or organization which extorts money from or in any way attempts to control any resident of Canada by force or by threat of bodily harm, or by blackmail-
The original section merely referred to blackmail. That is extended a little so as to include any person who belongs to any secret society or organization which attempts to extort money from or in any way to control any resident of Canada through force, or threat of bodily harm or of blackmail.
__or who is a member of or affiliated with any
organization entertaining or teaching disbelief in or opposition to organized government shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to belong to the prohibited or undesirable classes, and shall be liable to deportation in the manner provided by this Act, and it shall be the duty of any officer becoming cognizant thereof and of the clerk, secretary or other official of any municipality in Canada wherein any such person may be forthwith to send a written complaint to the minister, giving full particulars : provided, that this section shall not apply to any person who is a British subject, either by reason of birth in Canada, or by reason of naturalization in Canada.
Then there is a second subsection reading as follows:

Proof that any person belonged to or was within the description of any of the prohibited or undesirable classes within the meaning of this section at any time since the 4th day of May, 1910-
That is the date on which the present Immigration Act was assented to.
-shall for all the purposes of this Act be deemed to establish prima facie that he still belongs to such prohibited or undesirable class or classes.
What I understand that to mean is that if a person, by act or word, at any time since 1910, has done the things we have enumerated in this section then, prima facie, that person would be deemed to belong to these classes. While there is some material difference between the two sections still the main purpose of the section is as it was expressed in the section as originally introduced to the House.

My hon. friend quoted "" The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom "".
He went on to argue the point later by explaining that while he really said the Lord,"" he meant ""Parliament."" I can only say that if Parliament is to be judged in its personnel and ability by the length and irrelevance of a speech such as we have just heard, then I think to make ""Parliament"" and ""the Lord"" exchangeable terms is very unflattering to the Deity. That is

all I have to say about that. My hon. friend discoursed on many subjects that had very little to do with the measure before the House; indeed, I was almost raising a point of order until I began, towards the end of his speech, to get a glimmering idea that what he was really apprehensive of was that the constitution was going to be entirely smashed by a commission which is created to do the business of Government and Parliament in a little more businesslike manner.
The hon. member laboured the point a great deal, and several other members opposite have also laboured the same point during the last few weeks of the horrible autocracy that they allege has been existing in this Government for the last three or four years, the usurpation of the rights and powers of the people, the autocratic methods employed by government by Order in Council, and he and those who have spoken along the same lines seem persistently to forget either deliberately or unconsciously that there has been no such thing as an autocratic Government, because Parliament has put into the hands of the Government certain powers which the Government exercises, and hawing exercised them is responsible to this Parliament for what it has done. My hon. friend has used some very extraordinary arguments in support of the position which he has now expressed in the shape of a motion. Before he commenced that kind of argument, he complained that during the war the Government had had a very free hand in the expenditure of public money, but, he said, as we have now come to times of peace, the Government must exercise a closer control of its expenditures; there must be greater economy; there must be a reduction and an economy, the old watchword that is coupled with the name of Alexander Mackenzie whose example, I may say, my hon. friend and some of his friends did not always follow. He referred to the Minister of Railways' extravagance of expenditure, and I do not like to allow his reference to pass, because last night I listened to the Minister of Railways, and if the hon. member for Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) will pardon me, I must say I think his reference was very unfair, I would almost say grossly unfair, if that is parliamentary, to the minister who is not at present in the House. I took down his words while he was speaking, and he stated that the Minister of Railways, in regard to the Welland canal and the Trent canal had stated that the work that was

being done was practically useless. Those were his exact words, and he stated that the minister went on with those works only under the flimsy pretext of employing soldiers. I think if my hon. friend is going to contend that a fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, he had better bea/r his own words in mind and start getting wise before he so greatly misquotes the words uttered by a responsible minister of the Crown last night. He certainly cannot find in the statement made by the Minister of Railways that these works were practically useless, and that it was a flimsy pretext to go on. What the minister argued was that while there might not be a pressing necessity for going on with this work immediately, in view of the fact that there were thousands of soldiers returning to Canada and looking for work and also a great deal of unemployment in the country, which might create a dangerous situation, he thought it best to go on with the work now instead of at a later date. I will leave it tp the House if that is not a fair statement of the situation.

The reason for my decision shall be given more fully when the subject is under discussion in the House.
In view of the fact that the military business of the war, through demobilization, is not yet completed, permit me to say that only strong conviction upon this issue, reached after
earnest consideration, impels me to take this course.
I cannot refrain from expressing my appreciation of the heavy worries and responsibilities you have so courageously faced during the war, and particularly in the last year-worries and responsibilities which I venture to say the people of Canada do not yet fully understand ; and also the fine manner in which you have represented Canada overseas in the delicate and difficult negotiations preliminary to the signing of Peace.
Let me also thank you very sincerely indeed for the many courtesies and kindnesses you have shown during the past eighteen months, to one quite inexperienced in Parliamentary work and in the very intricate and difficult problems of Government in this country.
I am,
Yours truly,
(Sgd.) T. A. Crerar.
To which the following reply was given on the same day:
Ottawa, June 4, 1919.
My dear Mr. Crerar,-I have received with deep and unfeigned regret your resignation as a member of the Government; but I entirely appreciate and respect the sincerity of the convictions which have impelled you to take that course.
It will be my immediate duty to acquaint His Excellency the Governor General with your decision and to request his authority for the acceptance of your resignation.
During the period of nearly two years in which you have been one of my colleagues your high sense of public duty, your fine ability and your indefatigable energy have made your service to the country especially valuable. Within that period problems of an exceptionally difficult character have continually presented themselves and I am most grateful to you, and to all my colleagues, for the loyal assistance and earnest effort which on all such occasions have been of invaluable assistance to me in the consideration of such questions.
My association with you as one of my colleagues will j^ways be to me a happy memory; and I know that I may express this to you on behalf of all the members of the Government.
I am very grateful for your kind words in respect to my own part in public affairs since it has been my privilege to have you as one of my colleagues.
With every good wish, believe me, dear Mr. Crerar,
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) R. L. Borden.
Hon. T. A. Crerar, M.P.,
Ottawa.



The resignation has been accepted informally, as appears from the correspondence, and it will be accepted in the usual formal manner by Order in Council tomorrow.

The great objection to this commission business is that there is no one responsible. The commissioners are responsible to no minister directly. The War Purchasing Commission has been run by two or three clerks, engineered by the commission and fortunes have been built up for the favourites of the commissioners, contracts have gone almost invariably in the right direction, and I have no hesitation in saying that if the facts were made known as to the way in which the War Purchasing Commission conducted its business they would startle the people of Canada. They would be astonished at the tremendously high prices that have been paid. This whole system of Government has been running away from responsibility. I went into the war to overthrow autocracy and bring about responsible government in so far as we possibly could in Germany, in other countries and above all in Canada. This is a departure from responsible government, and it places in the hands of a commission the spending of $40,000,000 a year. If you will give me the management of that business, under the terms of this Bill, I will undertake to put any party in power at the next general election. If you have a purchasing agent for the department, the minister is responsible, he feels his responsibility, and he takes pains to see that the work is done in an efficient manner. I had to do with that business and I do not think there are anything like the irregularities going on that the general public claim there are in reference to these matters. I found that contractors were anxious to do the best they could, although there was an odd one here and there that had to be watched. I found the officers in almost all the departments toe keenest men alive. I have seen instances where contractors who had succeeded in bluffing the War Purchasing Commission tried to put the same bluff over

the purchasing agent of the department and failed, with the result that the department was able to purchase cheaper than the War Purchasing 'Commission did. When an analysis was made it was found that the prices paid by the War Purchasing Commission were for almost all commodities, higher, I know instances where local men were asked to give a quotation and their quotations were fifty per cent under the price that the War Purchasing Commission was furnishing to the department. I know of the manipulations that went on by the War Purchasing Commission to see that contracts were landed in the right centre. There will be under this system no direct responsibility and we must have responsibility when we are dealing with the administration of such- large sums as this. I agree with the objection which has been pointed' out by my hon. frien/d from Red Deer (Mr. Clark) on the question of responsibility. The minister of the department for which the purchases are made is not responsible and no one will care except the young purchasing agents who will make their millions out of it if they are permitted to go on long enough. One of the presidents of a large American railway corporation said: I would rather be president of the Inter-State Commerce Commission than president of the United States at $750,000 a year. The gentleman who will get the management of this commission will consider himself one of the most successful operators in the Dominion of Canada. The whole thing is an attempt to get this Government away from its responsibility to the House, to the members and to the people and that is one of the things that I want to fight against. Let the members be responsible to the people who elect them and let the people hold the members responsible. I am not afraid of that responsibility in my county, I never have been afraid and I never had a bit of trouble with any one in connection with this matter. Let the members, for once in the history of Canada, hold the ministers responsible.

NICHOLSON:,,PURCHASING OF DEPARTMENTAL AND OTHER SUPPLIES.,,,"There may be a purchasing agent in every department, but whether he is expert or not I do not know. If there is a purchasing agent in every department, the hon. member's question seems to imply that he would prefer to have a purchasing agent in every government department. But this Bill would eliminate separate purchasing agencies and concentrate the business under one department. We can amend the details of the Bill, but at the present moment we are dealing with principles. Take the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, whose system is divided into departments from coast to coast. There is not a department, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, that can buy a single dollar's worth of material without going through the purchasing department, because the men at the heads of the various departments are not purchasers and do not understand that business. They are managers and devote their attention to the conduct of the business of their particular departments. But they leave to experts the question of purchases and allow them to buy the goods they require. It has been objected that by employing a purchasing agency the Government is getting rid of its responsibility. If the Government concentrates the whole purchasing for the Dominion in one agency, is that evading responsibility to any greater degree than if it distributes the responsibility throughout a multitude of agencies? From the information that we have now, each head of a department purchases the supplies for that particular department in his own way. If this work is all concentrated in one purchasing department for which the

Government is directly responsible, does the Government thereby lessen its responsibility to the country? In my judgment it would only narrow the business down to a point where it would be controllable. As things stand now, it is uncontrollable and unwieldly. My hon. friend from Red Deer, with whom I always try to agree, has laid down the principle that you cannot effect economy unless you reduce the number of employees. If there is one man in each department to-day charged with purchasing for that department, and if he is capable of doing the work with which he is charged, lie cannot be of very much use for anything else. Therefore, taking that phase of the argument alone, if you bring all thesj men under one head and employ one purchasing agent nr agency, you will have eliminated a certain number of employees. 1 presume, without, having any figures before me. that this Government purchases millions of dollars' worth of goods every year and, I have no doubt, will continue to purchase equally large amounts annually from all sources. Is it not conceivable that by reducing the cost at which these goods are purchased and improving the character and quality of the goods and obtaining the best materials that can be put into each particular article, just as any ordinary business man would do, a saving could be effected? A large departmental store could not carry on business for six months if it permitted the heads of the various selling departments to act as purchasers at the same time. No large organization producing goods in this country could successfully operate on such a basis. A lumber firm could not carry on business ii the man who had charge of the work in the woods had to purchase the goods required in connection with the conduct of the business. In principle, I think the Government is starting out along the right lines. I have not read the details of the Bill. They may not be right, and the idea of a purchasing commission may be wrong. If, as the hon. member for North 'Oxford (Mr. Nesbitt) says, it is going to involve the employment of a commission and then a director, that would seem to me to be a case of overlapping, and if it is going to mean the employment of a large establishment, that again is entirely unnecessary. But with the principle of concentrating the whole business of purchasing the country's goods and placing it under the head of an expert or a small group of experts, I am entirely in accord, and contend that it will bear

analysis by any business man who wants to study it and ascertain what he would do il he were in the same position as the Government. I venture to say that if hon. members who have spoken were carrying on business for themselves, they would not even attempt to operate on any other basis than that outlined in the chief principle of this Bill, namely, the employing of experts to do work that necessarily calls for expert knowledge and a thorough acquaintance with a particular subject. Those who purchase supplies should thoroughly understand purchasing.

As I understand the proposition, it is not quite as outlined by 'the hon. member for Algoma (Mr. Nicholson). In my judgment the purpose of this Bill is not to establish a department such as the hon. member, has in mind-a central authority for the purchasing of all supplies of the various government departments-but to perpetuate under another name a department already in existence. I have had some slight experience with the War Purchasing Commission, and from that experience and actual knowledge I cannot agree with the claims made by the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowrell) who has charge of the Bill, that it has been an unqualified success.
I will call the attention of the House and of the President of the Council to a case in point. A tender was advertised in August last for 500 four-drawer filing cabinets. It had been the custom of the department to buy steel cabinets, it being claimed by the manufacturers that they were fireproof. A manufacturing firm that I am not directly interested in, beyond the fact that it is located in the riding which I have the honour to represent, manufactures filing cabinets of oak-precisely the same in operation, but made of wood. The contention of the department was, of course, that the steel cabinets, being fireproof, were to be preferred, notwithstanding the much higheT cost.
This manufacturing concern sought my services in regard to securing for them a ""look in"" on tenders for this class of material, and I found that it was almost impossible to help them. In passing I might just say that this purchasing board is a mere ""lean-to"" of the Public Works Department; it is not a separate entity in any sense of the word-a fact which I will illustrate later on. When I approached the Public Works Department I was told that it would be necessary for this manufacturing concern, with my assistance, to institute a propaganda through the various departments in order to secure endorsation by the departmental heads of wood instead of

steel cabinets. I do not think that it should be necessary either for a manufacturing concern or for members to indulge in such propaganda. If we were in a position to convince the department that it was in the public interest to buy these wooden cabinets, it should be the duty of some person to act accordingly. We were referred to the War Purchasing Board, and with no better results. They treated us in exactly the same way; that is to say, they took the position that it was none oi their business The requisitions were sent into the War Purchasing Commission, and they simply rubber stamped them and passed them on to the Public Works Department, which made the purchases. I do not think you can convince any intelligent business man that doing business along those lines is in the interest of this country or of the public service.
The contract for the 500 filing cabinets that I have in mind was tendered for at the rate of $41 for each steel cabinet. The same cabinet exactly in dimensions and in actual service, but made of oak, was obtainable at $27. That represents a saving of $14 on each cabinet, or an actual saving on the entire contract of $7,000. When I convinced the Minister of Public Works of this feature of the transaction, there was no difficulty whatever; an order was placed for the wooden cabinets. I understand he has given instructions that no further orders shall be given for steel cabinets. Whether that is correct or not, I am not sure, but that is my information.
During the course of my investigation I found that in the preceding fourteen months 2,500 steel cabinets were ordered at an average cost of $49 each, as against $27 for the wooden cabinet, or the enormous difference of $55,000. In other words, it cost the country $55,000 more for the cabinets purchased during the previous year through the War Purchasing Commission; and it must be remembered that this is merely one sample of work that happened to come to my personal knowledge. In the fourteen months the War Purchasing Commission had actually thrown away $62,000 of the public funds. If that is to be taken as a measure of the value of the service rendered by this 'Commission to the country, then, Sir, I say the sooner we dispense with it the better.
I agree with the ideal condition enunciated by the .member for Algoma, but 1 take exception to some of the examples he referred to. For instance, he stated that it is the custom with most of the large de-

partmental stores of this country to have purchasing agents independent of the heads of the various departments. I am sure he does not wish to be incorrect, but as a matter of fact he is not correct, because I know whereof I speak. The men who have charge of the departments in such stores are entirely responsible for their particular departments. They are experts in. their own line, and they do the buying and they supervise the selling. That is beyond doubt. But that is a different position altogether to the purchasing of supplies for the Dominion Government or for a large corporation like the Canadian. Pacific Bailway. It would be to the benefit of this country if such purchasing could toe done under the supervision of the head o.f a .department as outlined by the member for North Oxford; that, I think, would be an ideal condition. There is no need 'to establish another department of the public service with its elaborate staff to purchase the necessary supplies for the various departments, even if they do amount, as is claimed by the President of the Council, to the enormous sum iof $40,000,000 a year. Such purchasing could be effected by a less elaborate staff than is outlined in this Bill.
Other points I purpose to discuss at greater length when, the Bill is in the Committee stage; but there is one section I would like to call to the attention of the minister, and that is the section destroying the effective service of the whole proposition. I refer to section 12, subsection 2.
The commission shall have no authority to change or vary any requisition.
That is just exactly the position taken by the Commission in the case I have called attention to. When I appealed to them to listen to the arguments of the manufacturer of wooden cabinets, they said, "" We have nothing to do with that. We would not think of interfering with a requisition handed in to us by the head of a department."" That is a vital point in the service to be rendered by such a commission. They should be in a position, to dictate to any department the class of goods required for the Government service.
If a department requisitions gold-plated spittoons, I suppose the Purchasing Commission would have no authority to say; you cannot have them gold-plated; ordinary copper will have to do. If waste-paper baskets costing $32 were requisitioned, I suppose the commission would have no authority to change or vary the requisition. If a department ordered extravagant furni-

ture of any kind, I suppose the commission would have no authority to interfere. They simply rubber-stamp the requisition, it goes in as a matter of course, no matter what its character may be. I submit that this Bill is a monstrous thing, and that subsection 2 of section 12 destroys whatever value there might otherwise be in the proposal.

I do not quarrel with the principle of the Bill, although it seems to me that if you have a staff of expert purchasers you may create a department whidh will be a very great expense to the country. I have had many complaints from the superintendents of the different works in the county from which I come with respect to purchases. Most of the dredging plants in Manitoba are located in that county, as well as the fishing industries, dry docks, and other-public works; and the purchases there are considerable each year. The St. Andrew's locks are also located in that county. I am informed that under the present system goods which are purchased are costing more than they cost under the old system. ll do not know how correct that is; up to the present I have not had a chance of looking into the matter. As I understand it, under the old system the heads of the departments there were allowed to do the purchasing, and they were in a position to buy more cheaply because of their particular knowledge of the requirements. I do not know whether these purchases were made by the Purchasing 'Commission or not; the requisitions were made to the district engineer at Winnipeg. Circulars were sent out to these wholesale houses in	Winnipeg-I	do not think
they went outside of Winnipeg-and the purchases were made from those wholesale houses. The local men in the town of Selkirk, in which these industries are located, were not given a chance to bid on these purchases; notices were not sent to them at all. I am informed that if these men had had an opportunity of tendering they could have (furnished these supplies more cheaply than they were furnished by the wholesale houses of Winnipeg, because the cost of the supplies, including freight, cartage, and other incidental charges, was greater than it would have been had the purchases been made in the town of Selkirk by the superintendents of the different public works.
We should be careful at this time not to create any more commissions which will be a burden to the country. Under the old system, if it was properly carried out, we would be in a better position to get value for our money than we will be if purchases are made through a commission
5 p.m. who will really, in any case, have to take the word of the -superintendents of the different departments. They have no other means of finding out whether or not the supplies are necessary; they must aocept the advice of the superintendents of the different works. These superintendents are on the -spot; they know what is required, and they should be trusted to make the purchases for their departments.
I believe that complaints were made to the Public Works Department with regard to the right of the superintendents to make small purchases, and that the superintendents have been allowed to purchase only to the extent of $5. I would like this Bill to provide that the superintendents be -allowed to purchase up to a greater amount than that; I believe money woul-d be saved if they were. They should be allowed to purchase such articles as steam fittings and pipes, and other articles which they may need and which can be secured in almost any town in which these public works are located. Time and money would be saved by adopting this plan. In cases where requisitions have been made to the District Engineer at Winnipeg for supplies amounting to $25 or $30, delays have occurred and the job has had to wait until the supplies came to hand. )If, in cases like that, the superintendent had the right to purchase locally up to a certain amount, time and money would he saved, the work would proceed without interruption and the country would be benefited.
I ask -the minister in charge of the Bill to give this matter, whidh is one of great importance to the country, careful consideration, and to see whether some arrangement can be made under which purchases may be made by the men in charge of -these different public works throughout the country.

Looking hack upon conditions as they were before and as they were after -that commission was established, I have not -the slightest doubt that many

millions of dollars were saved to the people of this country by the course which I took in the spring of 1915. I have been in this Parliament for nearly twenty-three years, and I know something of 'the methods by which Government purchases have been made in the past, and I remember very distinctly the discussion and the suspicion which have frequently been aroused in connection with them. Every one who has been a member of this House, or has taken an interest in public affairs during past years, knows that the cry of unfair use of political power in respect of Government purchases was almost as strong, if not quite as strong, as the cry with respect to appointments to the public service. The principle upon which this Bill is founded. The principle upon which the Orders in Council were passed when I put forward the recommendation therefor in the spring of 1915 is precisely the same as that which has conferred very important powers upon the Civil Service Commission. That principle leads to such administration of public business as shall eliminate party political influence. The Government does not desire to abdicate responsibility; it would be absolutely impossible for it to abdicate responsibility even if it desired to do so. Whether you carry out purchases by a dozen different purchasing commissions, as has been the practice in the past, or by one purchasing commission, as is proposed by this Bill, the responsibility of the Government is the same.
A Government cannot shelter itself behind the acts of officials; it must accept responsibility for the acts of every official. If he is wrong, dispense with him, or if he is an official of the character proposed here, who can be removed only by vote of Parliament., bring his case to Parliament and ask Parliament to deal with him. In any case the responsibility of the Government continues from beginning to end.
I should be very sorry if the idea should prevail in this country that r would be better to return to a system under which beyond question political pressure and influence were- put forward and utilized, and not to adhere to a system under which, so far as I know, there has been an absolute lack of any suggestion that in making public purchases any interest except that of the public was regarded. I can say this further, that to mv mind it is exceedingly important that the time of members of the Government, which was inevitably taken up with such matters under the former system, should be free from such demands, 
and that tney should be able to say to members of Parliament and to all others: It is the duty of the particular department in question to put forward its requisition for supplies it may reasonably require, and when that requisition is put forward, you have the assurance of an absolutely independent commission that those supplies will be purchased with a sole eye to the public interest and with an absolute disregard of whether the persons who furnish those supplies belong to any political party or class. I repeat that in the public interest it is highly important that ministers of the Crown should not have their time taken up with claims put forward by persons who conceive themselves entitled to consideration. I know that my time was by no means free from questions and difficulties of that character before the Purchasing Commission was established in 1915; but since that commission was established, I do not believe that on an average one hour a month has been occupied with any such matter.
The hon. member for South Renfrew (Mr. Pedlow) has criticised the commission in respect of matters for which it is in no wise responsible. We never intended to give, nor do we now give the commission power to dictate to any department. Occasionally, during the past four years the members of the War Purchasing Commission have said this to me: There is such and such a requisition for an enormous quantity of supplies for war purposes; we really think this subject should be brought to your attention, because it seems to us. although we have no right to dictate, that the proposed supply is much greater than should reasonably be required. I have taken up the matter, and in many cases the representations of the War Purchasing Commission to me in that regard have resulted in a considerable reduction of the supplies ordered and purchased. After all it is simply a question of whether it is better to disperse the purchasing organization over fifteen, sixteen or seventeen departments, or to concentrate it under one systematic management. Apart from the considerations to which I have alluded, that is the chief question.
I am not going into the details of this Bill. We shall be glad of the advice and suggestions of every member of this House respecting the particular methods and proposals. We have an entirely open mind in regard to that. But I think it is my duty to say that, if there is any suggestion that the men whom I invited to undertake these

duties and who have carried them on during the past four years, have not given their full time, energy and attention to the purpose for which they have been appointed, that statement has no foundation whatever and that criticism is wholly undeserved. I know personally of the time and devotion that they have given to 1 this work, of the high and earnest sense of public duty with which they have approached it. I know further, that if the members of the Purchasing Commission had seen fit to do what I more than once urged them to do, namely to give a succinct and clear statement to the people of this country of the economies which they have made in purchases since they were first appointed in 1915, the proposals which are now presented to this House would be received with very much greater favour than has been apparent this afternoon. I, myself, have from time to time, discussed with Mr. George P. Galt, Mr. W. P. Gundy and Sir Hormisdas La-porte what the War Purchasing Commission has accomplished in economies and in saving of the funds of the public treasury during the past four years. I did no-t realize the full measure of their effective effort until casually I was told of it, sometimes; and I urged the members of the commission to prepare such a statement to be laid on the Table as would describe in suitable terms what had been accomplished in that regard. These men have been thoroughly devoted to their public duty; they have served without remuneration, and any reproaches which I have heard this afternoon aire, in my judgment, absolutely and wholly undeserved.
I desire to associate myself with what the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowell) said with regard .to the services of Mr. W. P. Gundy, a most earnest and devoted man who gave splendid service on this commission during eighteen months of this war, who was whole-hearted in his work and whose death is a very great loss to .the country, not only in the work which he was carrying on as member of the commission, but. in respect of the ideals and aspirations which as a good citizen of this country he always endeavoured to put forward and to uphold. I recollect very well that a few weeks after Mr. W. P. Gundy, who was a very able business man and whom I had never met before, was appointed to this commission, had come here to undertake his duties, he approached me one day and told me that he was not only intensely gratified but greatly surprised at the exceedingly efficient organization which had been built
up in the period before he became a member of the War Purchasing Commission.
We submitted to the commissioners as they were in September, 1918, the question as to making the commission permanent, and we asked them to set forth their views with regard to the matter and to put forward to us proposals which they would recommend in case the commission were to be a permanent one. The members of the commission at that time were Sir Hormisdas Laporte, Mr. George F. Palt and Mr. W. P. Gundy. I think I might, with advantage, read to the House some of the purely business considerations which they presented to me in a memorandum strongly advocating the continuance of the commission. They furnished this memorandum, of course, with the desire and intention to be relieved themselves from the duty of serving further upon the commission, and therefore, there was no personal interest which could have affected their judgment in the slightest degree. As a matter of fact, 'Sir Hormisdas Laporte has remained here discharging the duty of commissioner at great personal inconvenience, and more than that, great personal loss during the past five or six months. The disadvantages in the existing system, by which each department makes its own purchases, are according to their view these

will take the context of the Minister of Railway's remarks, I do not think he will find that the minister said it was useless, whatever objections he may have raised in regard to the Trent canal years ago, and I do* not think my hon. friend can twist the statement of the Minister of Railways into a statement that the work was practically useless. I thought it worth while to refer to this, especially as the motives and results as regards the soldiers have been very frankly and fully stated to the House by the Minister of Railways.
Let me refer to another argument of my hon. friend, and one which seemed to me rather extraordinary. He asked: Is this
present commission necessary? Is it necessary to make what was a temporary 'body during the war, a permanent body now that peace has come? My hon. friend referred to the absence of British blood in his veins, but said in passing that he had that French logic in his anatomy that would make reason apparent in his argument. All I can say is that there is* not much logic when my hon. friend says in one breath that the purchases during the war, which amounted to very large sums, made the creation of a commission necessary, because it protected the public treasury, and then at the same time argues that the commission is not necessary, because, apparently, the public treasury has not to be protected in times of peace. If his argument was true in times of war, it would, with the exception that there may not be so great purchases now, be equally justified in times of peace. My hon. friend seems to argue-and this is his main argument-that in some strange way we are smashing the constitution because a commission is being appointed to transact the business of buying the various departmental needs and requirements. He pointed out that under the old method there was governmental responsibility, ministerial responsibility, that the requisitions passed through several hands; that they were carefully scrutinized by the officials of the department, the deputy minister and so on, and that, therefore, there were all the necessary safeguards. Surely, my hon. friend cannot so misunderstand the purport of this Bill as not to know that the needs and requirements of the various departments for the requisitions that are put up will go through the same processes so far as requisitions go. As far as knowing what the actual needs of the department are, the department will be responsible, and those matters will be placed before the commission in the net result of a requisition for departmental requirements. The commission which has been established is not for requisitions; the responsibility for that is on the department, but it is for the purpose of putting in a business organization which will gather up all the multitudinous threads going through sixteen or eighteen departments where, perhaps, there may be seven or eight different experts or officers buying the same type of thing, into the hands of the central business organization which will be in touch with the whole of them. I cannot see what my hon. friend is afraid of in the way of responsibility. The minister will have to

come to this House; he will, after all, be responsible for what his department needs, and although the commission on account of its knowledge of the requirements of all the departments is created to do the actual buying certain responsibilities will rest with the minister of each department.
My hon. friend urges-and I thought this was a somewhat curious and illogical argument-that in some mysterious way the establishment of this commission would clip the claws of the Auditor General.
How on earth the Auditor-General's claws are to be clipped by a commission of this kind doing the actual purchasing, I fail to see. His functions are not interfered with one iota by this commission; he will discharge his functions in precisely the same way after the establishing of this commis-ion as before. It was a new doctrine, I think, to this House which the hon. member laid down when he said that the Auditor General was the nightmare of an honest minister. I thought he was the nightmare of a dishonest minister. Fear of the Auditor General would not be entertained by an honest minister; he has nothing to fear from the Auditor General. I cannot see in any shape or form how the Government or a minister would be abdicating his functions .by adopting practically what every vast business concern with innumerable branches does, namely, centralize the machinery for the actual purchasing of its requirements. My hon. friend in his diatribe on the commission business and on throwing off the responsibility of ministers, surely has not forgotten that the Government of which he was a member established a commission, the Railway Commission-and I have not a word except of praise for its establishment, and had not at the time it was established-which certainly is less responsible than a commission of this kind, because it is far less in contact with the various departments and the ministers. In the whole language used by my hon. friend I have failed to see one argument against the establishment of this commission; I have failed to hear one reason advanced why it would not facilitate public business of the country and of the departments. I fail to see why, to use my hon. friend's words, if it helped matters and safeguarded the public treasury in times of war, it would not equally do so in times of peace. I shall certainly therefore vote against my hon. friend's motion.

closing speech before we divided on this question was very strong in stating that there is no purchasing power in this commission except as it receives requisitions. I think he is mistaken. This section 6 gives the commission absolute power to buy everything, and it can secure a warehouse and store millions of dollars of goods in it for distribution to the different departments as requisitions are filed. The only restriction of that power seems to be in section 14:
The commission shall not, without the approval of the Governor in Council, purchase or agree to purchase any supplies except such as are included in estimates or requisitions sent to the commission by the various portions of the public service.
That is no restriction at all. If the commission comes to the Governor in Council and says that it wants to buy large quantities of goods, the Governor in Council are not very likely to constitute themselves judges as to whether the commission should make those purchases or not. Therefore apparently section 6 gives this body absolute and unresfricted power for the purchase of whatever it may require-and as ,far as using it as an engine for patronage is concerned, it is the worst that was ever introduced into this country.
The fact that what was spread over eighteen or nineteen departments, and was not as strong as it might be on that account, is now given greater force, greater strength, greater momentum, so to speak, by being organized into one department. This is an organized system of patronage, and it will be exercised as such. To a person like myself, who is up against these things every day and knows what is going on, it is laughable-or is it not rather sad?-to hear men who are, no doubt, honest, say that there is no patronage. Why, patronage in connection with Government business is just as it always was. And now we are going to have an institution that will have power to exercise patronage wherever it wants to. If tremendously big

purchases are had in mind; if it is deemed necessary to have rake-offs, corruption, bribery, this is the institution where these things can come in. There is no check on these men, except that of their being supposed to go through the formality of getting the permission of the Government for the purchase of (supplies. The member for Antigonish and Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair) has given us an instance of what
11 p.m. is going on in this Department now. They destroyed what was known as the patronage list, but they have substituted something else that is just as effective

a system of ""selection."" What is the difference between calling a newspaper a ""selected newspaper"" and putting its name on a ""patronage list""? The only difference is that the man who is exercising the patronage may have to make out new lists very frequently-or he may be told to use the old list.
We are told that there is no patronage now in the Civil Service. I admit that the conditions are a little better now as regards to the appointment of returned soldiers, but before that element came in we had nothing but the old-time, hard-and-fast party patronage system. I had two cases last year in my own county. A customs officer and a postmaster had to be appointed, and two of the most ardent Tories in the district were selected for these positions. If that was a coincidence, it was a remarkable one. The same thing has been going on throughout the whole of my county. There is a letter on file in the office of the Civil Service Commission which I wrote in connection with these two positions. I said, in a communication to the Chairman: ""Both officials who occupied these positions were Tories. I will give you the names of two men, one a Liberal and the other a Tory, and I think it is fair that you should appoint these men."" I may add that I was recommending the Tory for the better position of the two. But my recommendation was absolutely ignored ,and two of the choicest brand of Tories were appointed. The minister will excuse me if I have no faith in these professions of the -non-existence of patronage. Patronage is being exercised everywhere, and will continue to he exercised; it cannot be otherwise under present conditions. We know that two of the present members of the Civil (Service Commission are tried and trained Tories. Nobody need tell me that these men are not taking the advice of their friends in different parts of the country as to whom they should appoint. That explains how they got the two men from Bras d'Or in Victoria

County; that is how they are getting men all over the country. Let nobody think for a moment that men can fool the people by making splendid speeches and saying that there iis no patronage. How delighted the people of Ontario were when they heard from the Prime Minister himself that there was no patronage. My friend the President of the Council said ""amen"" to this pronouncement, and people rejoiced and praised the Lord that this great day had arrived. When the Military Service Act was passed, there were some ""amens"" and some ""hosannas"", but there was a louder ""hosanna"" when the President of the Council announced, by telegrams, cables, messages, runners and fiery crosses throughout Ontario, that the Military .Service Act was passed for Quebec, but that it was not to be used in Ontario, and that the farmers' sons were at liberty to do as they liked. But we in this House, are getting .a little too old, a little too hard and crusty, any longer to be entertained by such speeches as we heard this afternoon and this evening from the President of the Council and the Prime Minister on this subject. For my part, .I would have more respect for the judgment and the honesty of hon. gentlemen if they would take things as they are and not try to throw camouflage over the real state of affairs. The truth is too apparent to the dullest person in the House or in the country. So far as patronage is concerned, nothing is different from what it was in the good days when party patronage was exercised by the .party that for the time being held sway in the House of Commons. That is what is going on now, although it is not admitted as it was on other occasions.

It should be provided that the department would be limited to the amounts voted by Parliament. In that way the House would indirectly be in a position to ascertain the operations of the commission.
