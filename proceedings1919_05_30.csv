I am not altogether convinced of the present practical value of the Gazette. There is, however, this to say, that many special articles appear in this journal. For instance, the results of some experimental work that may have been carried on by the entomological department, as an illustration, or in any particular branch, or in some other field of activity in connection with agriculture, are often recorded in articles published in the Gazette. These articles go out to the agricultural district representatives. I believe that in practically all cases they keep their files complete and the Gazette really becomes a sort of reference library to these workers. This undoubtedly has value. I am not certain that the same results, or practically as good results could not be obtained if the Gazette
were published quarterly instead of monthly, and that is under consideration now.

record the case of a man who has not been given justice by the Board of Pension Commissioners and to get, if possible, the minister's assurance that he will take an interest in getting the Board to settle the case justly. I refer to the case of a private named John Taylor, whose regimental number was 439,640 and Pension Board Number 32,019. This man was wounded in France. He came home, and on the strength of having an injured arm-an arm that appeared to me to be paralyzed-he was given a pension of $5 a month. I met him quite by accident and I found that his right hand was absolutely paralyzed and his right arm out of use because of this paralysis-and he was receiving the magnificent sum of $5 a month. I took the matter up with the Board of Pensions Commissioners by wire on December 19th last, informing them that this man was getting $5 a month and that 1 considered it a disgrace to the country that he should be so treated. They wrote to me informing me that this man's hand was not paralyzed. They said:
On discharge it is found] that fingers could be moved passively through all the entire extent of normal movements and that the gTasp was lessened. There is no sign of injury to the nerves, and it was the report of the medical examiner at Port Arthur which stated1 that most of the condition was due to psychic disturbance, and not to any organic injury to nerves or muscles.
Further on they said:
The spasm of the muscles of the forearm and hand disappearing under an anaesthetic.
I communicated with them again in a letter dated December 27 objecting to their decision on the ground that even if this man's case was one of psychic paralysis, as they called it-that is, more or less imaginary-unless they cured that psychic paralysis the man had every right to a proper pension. I still adhere to that opinion. If a man loses the use of his arm through service at the front he deserves to be treated properly by his country-and this man has not been treated properly by the Board of Pensions Commissioners in
;:002

receiving an allowance of $5 a month when his right arm has been put out of business. Whether the disability is psychic or organic is beside the question, to my mind; unless the paralysis is cured the man has a right >to a pension. I also informed the Board that the fact that this man's fingers could be moved passively had nothing to do with the case, because to earn one's bread one had to move his fingers actively. I said further that the disappearance of the paralysis under an anaesthetic was also beside the question, as a man under an anaesthetic would find it difficult to earn a living.
I again wrote to the Board about this case and they claimed that Mr. Taylor was under treatment by the Invalided Soldiers' Commission. At the time they said he was being treated by that Commission he was working in Fort William-I admit that they were misinformed, through no fault of theirs. The most treatment the man had during the four months that he was supposed to be under the Invalided Soldiers' Commission was four days, but he received no pension during the (4) months that he was supposed to be under treatment. Later they paid him $20 for the four months. After working three months on this case, after many letters and other correspondence I succeeded in getting him re-boarded somewhere around March 5. He advised me to this effect, and he was then granted a 45 per cent pension, which would mean a pension of about $20 a month, which shows that a mistake was made in the first place when they gave him a pension of $5 a month. They were, however, not satisfied with that, and they sent him to Winnipeg to he boarded again, and the Winnipeg Board also recommended him for a 45 per cent pension, he tells me. He came back to Fort William about the middle of March, and he wrote me he was content to get this pension. But he waited another two months and after hearing no more about it he wrote to me again, and I once more drew their attention to this. They then advised him to go back to Winnipeg again for re-examination, and the man refused, and to my mind quite rightly. He had already been sent to Winnipeg twice and had been examined by neurologists in Winnipeg. Why, then, should it be necessary for this man to be put to the trouble of going to Winnipeg the third time with the possibility of losing his job? He was receiving a pension of only $5 a month and he was earning his living. Besides, this would mean putting the country to the expense of taking him all the way to Winnipeg a third time.

It was some time about the middle of May that he advised me he was not going to go to Winnipeg any more, as he had to earn his living. I advised him I thought he was perfectly justified in not going, and I advised the Pension Board to that effect, because I do not think that man has received justice from the board. In reply to my letter, they advised me that they were giving the matter consideration. This is a case which has not yet been settled, although it is almost six months since I first drew the attention of the Pension Board to it, and it is high time that the board woke up to the fact that this man is being treated with absolute injustice. He was recommended for a 'higher pension, but they have not yet given it. I do not wish to take up any more of the time of the committee, but I wish to get an assurance from the minister that he will see that this man gets justice at the earliest possible moment.

We found this situation: Due to the commandeering order in the United States and the lack of control over the margin of profit in that country, the butter price had gone up, as I have stated, from 12 to 18 cents a pound, and it was fully that much higher in the United States than in Canada. One thing obviously resulted. The Canadian farmers found a market in the United States available and they found that they could get much higher prices there for milk and cream than they could get in Canada under the commandeering order. Of course, they naturally commenced to take advantage of this. Hon. members will appreciate that if this was permitted those farmers who were so situated in Canada that they could ship their milk and cream to the United States, would be in a position of great advantage over those other farmers who could not avail themselves of that facility. Moreover, the principal purpose for which this requisition order had been issued would be to a large degree defeated. We wanted to get butter to supply Great Britain but we wanted to do it with fairness to all the interests concerned. We did not want to do it in a way that would unduly enhance the price to the Canadian consumers and we wanted to deal fairly with the farmers who were producing it. The price was fixed at one and one and a half cents a pound higher than that which hitherto had been paid and an embargo restriction was imposed on the shipment of milk and cream to the United States. It was not imposed in the absolute sense that the hon. member for Huntingdon has suggested. Those farmers who had a market, or who had their regular customers in the United States were permitted to send out the same amount of milk and cream they had hitherto been sending in order that they might retain their connections for the period of this temporary disturbance. Consequently, they continued to enjoy that right during the whoto period of the embargo. Every farmer however who had not a market already established in the United States was prevented from sending his milk and cream out. That was retained in Canada for the purpose of producing butter for shipment -overseas. The quantity of butter that was manufactured in these factories during this period

amounted to something over 5,000,000
pounds.	[DOT]
The hon. member has alluded to the Dairy Produce Commission which was really the agent of the British Ministry of Food in purchasing dairy products in Canada. That commission had as its chairman, and its chief administrative officer, Mr. James Alexander of Montreal who is one of the oldest cheese dealers in the city.
I want to say-and I have very intimate knowledge of the facts-that Mr. Alexander gave freely and unstintedly his time and attention to the work that he had in hand.
I have had repeated evidence from the officials of the British Ministry of Food as to their satisfaction with the manner in which that work was carried on. In addition there were on that Dairy Produce Commission, Mr. Ruddick, the Dairy Commissioner of Canada, and there were also two representatives of the farmers, or milk producers, of Canada, Mr. James Donaldson, of Atwood, president of the Western Ontario Dairymen's Association, and Mr. Guerin, of Quebec. Every step in this whole proposal was considered fully by the members of the Dairy Produce Commission on which, as I have stated, there were two farmers representing the dairying interests in Canada. The commission were in entire agreement as to the policy that should be followed. It is a mistake to think that the milk and cream producers in Canada were not directly represented in that matter. They were directly represented by the two representatives of the Dairyman's associations. The Dairy Produce Commission has wound up its work. The importation of butter and dairy products into Great Britain has been decontrolled and is now back in the hands of private traders. I wish to say in conclusion that in my judgment-and I have a fair knowledge in connection with it-the Dairy Produce Commission has rendered excellent service not only to the British Ministry of Food but also to the producers of Canada.

I notice that on the former occasion it was stated that there was no discrimination so far as the salaries of the county court judges throughout the Dominion are concerned. That is true as regards the salaries of county court judges under that title, but I would like to ask the Acting Minister of Justice if it is not a fact that the judges in the province of Quebec who hold a similar position to the county court judges in the other provinces are not paid higher salaries? If I am not mistaken the Superior court judges in that province hold positions equivalent to those of county court judges in the other provinces, and are paid higher salaries than those County Court judges are. I also noticed that in the debate the other day the point was made that in the other provinces the salaries of the County Court judges are augmented by the provinces themselves. That, I think, is clear proof that the salaries are not considered adequate, and I think no member of the House would for a moment urge that a stipend of $3,000 a year is by any means suitable for a County Court judge under existing conditions. I believe that British Columbia is the only province, in the West at least, that does not add to the salaries given these judges by the Dominion Government. In considering what the salary ought to be it seems to me that the Dominion Government has nothing whatever to do with additions to judicial salaries which the provinces may make. In British Columbia up to some twenty years ago the salary was enhanced by the provincial government appointing each County Court judge a stipendary magistrate, which carried with it an additional $500. That system was done away with something like twenty years ago, and there is now only one judge in the province who receives that additional

salary. The change did not affect those judges who were acting as stipendary magistrates at the time, but was applied to those who have since been appointed.
I would strongly urge that' the question of an increase in salary for these judges be not only given consideration, but favourable consideration, by the Government.

When it was before us on a previous occasion I tried to make clear what my own views were on the subject, and I am not going to take up the time of the Committee by repeating them now. I do not know what the views of the minister may be as to the salary that should be paid to these judges, but in view of the fact that we are granting salaries of $6,000 and $7,000 to officials in the
Government service who are not doing any more important work than that which devolves upon the judges of the County Court, I would certainly suggest to the minister, if the suggestion is of any assistance to him, that the salaries of County Court judges should not be less than $5,000. The case of the judges in the province of British Columbia has been advanced, and in the representations on their behalf I absolutely concur. However, I have no special request to make for the judges of one province more than those of another; I think the County Court judges throughout the country should receive the same salary. I might say, though, that it has been brought to my notice that in the chief city of Manitoba, the province of the Acting Minister of Justice, the County Court judge only receives $3,000 a year, whereas in Halifax and St. John, and other large provincial centres, the County Court judges receive $3,500.
There is no reason why the leading Cbunty Court judge in the metropolitan city of Manitoba should get less than a County Court judge at Halifax or St. John. The minister will have in mind the leading County Court judge in Winnipeg. I am not acquainted with him and do not know his name, but no doubt the minister knows him well; I understand that he is a capable man and ranks favourably with those occupying similar positions in other leading cities of the Dominion.
1 submit that the Superior Court judges in all the provinces should receive the same salary. In Nova Scotia, for instance, the Superior Court judges do not get the same salary as judges performing similar duties in Quebec and Ontario. I shall not take the comparison further west; but these judges are all in the same class; they administer the same laws and exercise the same jurisdiction, and their salaries should be uniform,. The minister pointed out the other day that the difference between the salaries of some of the judges in New Brunswick and Manitoba was due to the fact that, some of them were judges of the Court of Appeal. That does not apply to Nova Scotia, because our Circuit Court judges are judges of Appeal. The province has elected that for all time the judges of the Circuit Court shall be also judges of the Court of Appeal, and as these judges are satisfactorily doing the work of both courts, tney should receive the same salary as the Superior Court judges in other provinces.

Until twenty years ago the senior County Court judges received $2,600 a year and the junior judges $2,000 a year. That remuneration was, perhaps, good enough for the time when people were not so luxurious and so extravagant as they are now and when the incomes of merchants and millers and other people generally wtere low. But as the incomes of the townspeople increased it was felt that the judges should be put on a par with the persons whom they would meet in a business way, socially, or otherwise. It was not deemed proper that the judge, who had the affairs of the people in his hands for adjudication, should be thought to be a man living from hand to mouth. He should be an independent person and be able to take his place socially or any other way with the best people in the community-Accordingly, about twenty years ago the salaries were raised to $3,000. But the purchasing power of a dollar is only half what it Was, and, following out. the principle upon which this remuneration was fixed years ago, we must surely increase it so that it will meet the condition brought, about by the decreased purchasing power of the dollar. I am glad that the minister received such a definite reply to his suggestion from Ontario. At the recent session of the Ontario Legislature they took away all the junior judges-whose remuneration has been $3,000, the same as the-senior judges-except in two countries, York and Wentworth, where the judges have a great deal to do. Twenty-eight junior judgeships are done away with and the positions will not be filled; but when senior judgeships become vacant the positions will be filled from these junior judgeships. This will result in a very large-saving in a few years-probably from $50,000 to $80,000. That sum might well be distributed among the seniors who are left in the different counties. A county court judge cannot at present keep up the social position which the people expect him to-keep up, nor educate his family properly,.

nor buy the necessary books to keep up with the literary and social events of the day, unless he has a salary o-f at least $5,000 a year, and I sincerely trust the Government will come to the conclusion that the remuneration of judges should not be less than that sum.

It was stated that the judges who had to do the work lived so far away from where the court sat that it was difficult for them to get there, and when they got there, they were 'in a hurry to return to their own district, and that the administration of justice was suffering very much in those sections.

He pointed out that Superior Court judges in Quebec received $5,000 while county court judges in other provinces received $3,000. There is, however, a difference in jurisdiction, but there is in Quebec really no bench corresponding in jurisdiction and certainly no bench corresponding in salary with the county, or district court bench, as it may be called, of the other provinces. I have not progressed with the subject far enough to say that I have reached any intention at all. The whole subject has to be considered as one-a Dominion wide subject.
Referring to the observations of the hon. member for Parkdale (Mr. Mowat) as to the opinion of the Bar of Canada, I have received from members of the Bar and from Bar associations, resolutions large in number and influential in signatures, all in favour of a substantial increase to judges. That body of opinion has left no doubt in the mind of the department as to what it considers should be done.

That being the case, it logically follows that when the struggle for existence becomes more intense the pay should increase, and that applies to every branch of industry, to the workingman and the professional man. If this is not done, we must have unrest even among the judges; if the unrest becomes acute it becomes a riot; if it becomes more acute still and the struggle more intense, it becomes a revolution. We must surely expect to observe the common logic of facts. If pay, therefore, is a reasonable recompense the pay must be increased as the struggle for existence becomes more intense.

I trust that some of the Quebec judges-1 do not know about judges in the other provinces-will see their way clear towards rendering judgment within say three or four years after a case has been placed before them for decision. This is a matter which ought to engage the attention of the Department of Justice. The delays in the matter of handing down judgments have almost approached a scandal. I confess that

when I see the judgments over which some judges have been spending so much time, I am mystified as to the long delays. Within the last few years there have been made to the bench appointments of several men who probably consider that they have been placed there simply as pensioners, because little is ever done by these gentlemen to see that speedy judgments are handed down. I speak about this matter advisedly, and while probably I am somewhat out of order, I hope that bringing this matter to the attention of the Committee will make some of these judges understand that they are, after all, servants of the public, as other people in the Civil Service are, and that they must do their duty as other employees in the Government service do.

A judge, besides receiving a salary while on the bench, can, after a certain number of years, get a retiring allowance. After fifteen years, he can retire on an allowance equal to two-thirds of his salary, and after twenty or twenty-five years, on an allowance equal to his salary. If one looks through the judges' accounts, one will find that there are in this country quite a few retired judges receiving large retiring allowances, some $8,000, some $7,000 and some less. There is a provision in the law that if a judge, through physical disability becomes incapable of discharging the duties of his office he is entitled to receive a liberal allowance, amounting in some cases to two-thirds of his salary and at least to one-half. We must also take into consideration the fact that judges are not liable for income tax, while members of other professions are. Therefore, the Acting Minister of Justice should take these things into consideration when he receives recommendations to increase judges' salaries. The cost of living to-day is so high that everybody is asking for an increase in salary, but there would be no necessity for increasing salaries if the Government took measures to lower the cost of living. Some of the civil servants have been granted an increase in salary; too much, I think. The Government has appointed a commission to re-classify the Service, and should have awaited their report before raising the salaries of the deputy ministers, because if the report finds their salaries too high the Government would find it rather difficult to decrease them. I hope that the Committee which has been appointed to inquire

into the cost of living will bring about a reduction in the cost of living, and if that is the result the salaries which we have paid to the judges since 1905 would then be sufficient, and the country would save the large amount involved in this proposed increase.

The question raised by the hon. leader of the Opposition is, of course, an important one, but I cannot give, with any degree of accuracy, the number of people that have left the farms in Canada during the past year, or the number of those who have taken up farming. At present there is some difficulty in certain parts of Canada in securing an adequate supply of farm labour. This, I think, is due perhaps to the natural unrest that has ensued from the trying experiences through which the country has passed during the last four years. Generally speaking, agriculturaTconditions throughout Canada are good at the present time. A brief survey of agricultural results for the past year shows that in the Western Provinces the crop has suffered from drought and frost. However, with the abundant optimism characteristic of the Prairie Provinces, the farmers have settled down to work, and according to the most reliable information I have been able to obtain, there has been planted this year a larger acreage in cereals than was the case even last year, and I am very happy to say that the crops in Western Canada this spring have been planted in better condition than for several years past. We had an abundance of moisture practically all over the Prairie Provinces, and the prospects at the time of seeding and immediately after were excellent. Of course, our final crop returns will depend almost entirely on weather conditions during June and July. There is not such a fortunate condition of affairs in Ontario. There has been a great deal of rain in this province, and there have been difficulties in getting seeding completed, so that on the whole the situation is somewhat backward. However, it is not too much to hope that we may have good returns from Ontario and Quebec. Conditions in the Maritime Provinces are very good as far as we can gather.

I might perhaps, at the risk of wearying the Committee a little bit, give some more information on that subject. The fact is patent that almost all of our agricultural produce has its price fixed in
the outside markets of the world. There is scarcely any agricultural products produced in Canada that we are not exporting to some extent. I find that the total value of these exports for the year ended March 31, 1919 was almost $400,000,000. I quite believe that that amount iB capable of great expansion. Unfortunately, there are many districts in Canada where there is a lack of appreciation on the part of the farmers of the value of management in their business and of quality in their production. We enjoy to-day, for instance, in the markets of Great Britain the first position in so far as our bacon exports are concerned.

That is due to the type of bacon hog that is produced in Canada. We also have the premier position in Great Britain with respect to our cheese industry, the foundation of which was laid many years ago by Dr. Robertson who has done much excellent work for agriculture in Canada.
I have endeavoured on all occasions to impress upon Canadian farmers the importance of quality in their production. Particularly is there need for that in regard to the quality of the beef that we export to the European market. I was surprised to learn from the representatives of the British Ministry of Food that Canadian beef was regarded as inferior to the article imported from Argentina and the United States. We have had within the past year, several conferences with representatives of the Canadian breeders and live stock men's associations. This problem with others has been discussed with them and we have taken every possible means to impress upon, and to bring home to them, the importance of this .matter, and I think this has resulted in a quickened interest in it.
There is no reason why Canada, having in mind its geographical location, should not attain a very high place indeed in agriculture. We are closer to the European markets, and especially the great consuming market of the United Kingdom, than any other country outside of Europe, and the trade routes by which our produce reaches those markets traverse the temperate zone. When one considers that a vessel can make three trips from Canada to Liverpool in the time required for one trip from Melbourne to Liverpool, and two trips from Canada to Liverpool in the time consumed by a trip from Buenos Aires to Liverpool, our advantage in that respect is readily seen.

With reference to the embargo in Great Britain on Canadian cattle, I notice that some papers in the United Kingdom are referring to it occasionally and are asking the British authorities to lift that embargo, which has been a sort of a stigma against Canadian cattle. My hon. friend probably knows the merits of the question better than I do. He knows that for years the British authorities have ordered our cattle to be slaughtered at the landing ports in the United Kingdom, practically at Liverpool, under the pretext that they were diseased and suffering from pleuro-pneumonia. It has been established beyond a doubt, however, that our cattle are absolutely free from that disease, and if my hon. friend wants the best available evidence on the subject, I might refer him to the testimony of the late Sir Charles Tupper. I must say to the credit of the old Conservative chieftain that while he was our High Commissioner in London he waged a bonny fight for Canada on that question. He states in his memoirs how on several occasions he approached the Board of Trade in England in order to have the embargo removed, and he offered to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the excuse given by the British authorities for the exclusion of Canadian cattle was in the nature of a very flimsy pretext. Being a medical man himself who, in his day, was renowned as a practitioner, he even went so far as to present himself at the abattoirs in Liverpool where, removing his coat and rolling up his shirt sleeves, his hands dripping with the blood of the animal, he made tests which proved beyond

contradiction that the excuse given by the British authorities for the embargo was no excuse at all. However, nothing was done to meet the wishes of Canada, and the agitation for the lifting of the embargo went on for years. Finally the question was brought up when the Imperial Conferences began to be held, and I have noticed that the question was raised on the occasion of each of these .conferences in London. It was brought up first by Sir Charles Tupper, then by the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and finally, if I mistake not, by the present Prime Minister. It appears that a few months ago the enforcement of the embargo was a lively question in the Old Country, and my attention has been directed to the fact that certain of the press of the United Kingdom are now asking the British authorities to lift it. Were any steps taken during the Prime Minister's stay in London with a view to carrying out this policy, which appeals to every true Canadian and to every cattle-raiser in Canada?

I am not thoroughly familiar with the steps that were taken, but I do know that at the Imperial Conference in 1917 the matter was brought up, and it was brought up again last year. Dr. Robertson went overseas last June in a representative capacity for the Department of Agriculture to look into the food situation and to gather what inforrnation he could as to future food prospects generally and as to how Canada could best co-operate in assisting the Allies. I asked him at that time to assist the Prime Minister who was then in Great Britain, to bring this matter in the proper way before the British authorities. That was done. Dr. Robertson again went
188J
over with the Prime Minister when he left Canada last year to attend the Peace Conference. We had gathered all the data and information that we could in Canada bearing upon the matter, and he has been active in taking the matter up with the British authorities since that time. In February we sent to Great Britain the Live Stock Commissioner for Canada to supply any additional information that might be required. Various breeders were interviewed and everything possible was done to remove the misconception existing in the minds of many British stockmen with regard to the probability of this disease or any other disease coming from Canada. I think we were able to convince them that Canada, has a clean bill of health in regard to her live stock. I venture the assertion that there is no country in the world which guards the health of animals more carefully than Canada does. The matter is at present under consideration. All I can say is that we are hopeful that something will be done and that these markets may be opened up to us, at least in some degree, ot as they were prior to the imposition of the embargo.

keeping in touch with the minister and his work during the year and 1 find that we have the right man in the right place. There is every reason to say that he has been doing good work. The experimental farms, large and small, are doing good work. There is a small one in the county which I represent; it is well situated and furnishes much useful information. The officials at that experimental farm station give instructions upon the cultivation of com, grain and potatoes and information with regard to different kinds of soil, and so on. It is a great benefit to the county, and I wish the minister would do even a little more in the way of improving it. The farm is easy of access-a good gravel road leads to it-but we are wanting a little in equipment; we want better tools and machinery. A farm needs a lot of machinery; it is about as easy to equip a mill as it is to equip a farm with the right machinery. A great deal of the unrest that prevails in this country is due to the fact that not enough of us are on the farm. The farm will have to be made more attractive; the work will have to be made a little easier. With the assistance of the Government a

great deal can be done in a few years along this line. The present minister has had two or three years' experience; he is still a young man, and I would be sorry to see [DOT]him drop out. I hope that the reports in [DOT]the press that he is about to resign are not true. Although we differ in politics, yet I can say that he is doing his best for the farming interests of the country. The farmers have never been attended to as they should be. This country has been throwing bouquets in .the way of titles to exploiters, the railroad men, the financiers. It, is true that some dropped on good soil, but some certainly dropped on stony ground. I have yet to hear of the farmer who received a title, although many farmers have richly earned them. Farmers have spent half a lifetime in securing the best seed wheat that could be produced [DOT]and sending it among the farmers, thus assisting in the raising of enormous crops in three western provinces. In this part of the country men have spent a lifetime perfecting stock-horses, cattle, cows, pigs, sheep, and everything that belongs to the farm; yet I do not see that the Government has thrown titles on any of their shoulders. I am sorry that titles are cut out, so far as that goes, because I would like to see some conferred upon the farmers.

We can go ahead with manufacturing and railroading, but farming is the backbone of any country. As the county that I represent is composed principally of farmers I hope that the Government will keep to their good course and do all they can to encourage the farming industry,
In .my judgment, the high cost of produce is the principal cause of strikes in this country, because a man's salary will not buy suitable clothes, provisions and food for himself and his family. We must, therefore, reduce the price of provisions, and the only way to do that is for more of us to go on, the land, to cultivate the soil and to produce. We have in Canada one of the greatest countries the sun shines on and we may be proud of the country we inherit. We have in Canada sufficient land for a hundred million people. I have been informed that in the Peace river district there is room for thousands upon thousands of people, and that one can find there the very best of farming land. Settlers can go into that district for the

next fifty years and yet there will be room. It is a district that is not nearly as cold as Manitoba or some of the other western provinces. We should cut out politics and get to farming, as it is the only thing that is going to save this country.

It was to me, personally, a source of much satisfaction that I was able to prevail on Dr. Grisdale to accept this position. I think he knows agriculture generally throughout Canada better than any other man-at all events better than any other man I have met.
With regard to the policy of the department in making appointments, we are following wherever possible the principle oi promotion within the department rather than going outside for officials. I think that principle is sound in every respect and encourages those within the department, no matter what their position may be, to put forth their best efforts.
The hon. member for Argenteuil (Mr. McGibbon) dwelt on the importance of experimental farms as a means of agricultural education. I quite agree that the experimental and demonstration farms are one of the best means of bringing home to

our farmers the advantages of better methods of cultivation and production generally. It must be borne in mind, however, that these farms, as their names imply, are largely experimental. We have in Canada to-day, outside of the Central Experimental Farm at Ottawa, 20 experimental farms and stations, 3 tobacco stations, 7 sub-experimental farms or substations as we call them, and 44 illustration farms. I look to the development of the illustration farm as perhaps the best means of bringing within the reach of the average farmer a knowledge of better methods of cultivation and general improvement in agricultural methods. These illustration farms are worked on the -following plan. A district is Selected and examined, and one of the best -farmers of the district who is willing to undertake the work is asked to associate himself with the work of the experimental farms. A certain plot o-f -his land is set apart, and he cultivates this plot under the direction and supervision of the representative of the department, who visits him at stated periods. In Western Canada last fall, in- the drought-stricken area, we had one or two striking illustrations of the value of this work, particularly as to the effect of proper soil cultivation on the retention of moisture in the soil, with consequent greater production. That work is being actively carried on. The purely experimental farm is, of course, of great value, but the illustration- farm can at a small -expense be brought within the reach of almost every farmer.
There is another point, and a very important one. It is a conclusion I have reached as the result of my experience in the department and of the study I have been able to -give the subject generally. There is expended in Canada through the Federal and Provincial Departments of Agriculture approximately $7,500,000 annually. I am convinced that from the national point of view -we are not getting the results from that expenditure that might be secured. In my judgment, there should be closer co-operation and better co-ordination between the federal and provincial activities. I found on making inquiries that in many cases federal and provincial activities were overlapping-that both federal and provincial departments were in- certain cases carrying on the same line of work. Now that is a waste of effort, and I might add also, a waste of money. At this particular time, when our national expenditure is mounting very rapidly, and we shall have to face in the future heavy taxation

and probably difficulties in raising the necessary revenue it is of the greatest importance, not only in the field of -agriculture, hut in every other field, that -there -should be the closest co-operation and coordination between federal and provincial activities. I have already mentioned this matter to a few provincial ministers of agriculture, and they were quite sympathetic to the idea. This is an important matter, and I -hope it will be more fully inquired into during this year.

Coming from New Brunswick, a province in whidh there are the two races and languages, I may say that the reputation of the minister is as high there as it is in Quebec. During the last few years the farmers of New Brunswick have taken new heart in their industry and have doubled their production. The deputy minister is also well known in the district from which I come, to the French Acadians as well as to the Scotch, Irish and English, and I am sure the new appointment meets with their approval and good wishes, and that it will encourage the farming community in that section of Canada.
Some years ago, just before the Liberal party went out of power, I had been in hopes of having an experimental farm established at Petit Rocher which would be a central part for all the people of northern New Brunswick, from the Matapedia district to the Miramichi.
We have along these ehores shipping facilities, wharfs, breakwaters and harbours by which steamer communication would be established with the other side of Bay des Chaleurs. Besides railway connections there
is in that portion of the country the best and most improved highway in the province and one that is second to none in Canada. An experimental farm of modest dimensions could be established to start with, and I am sure it could be very rapidly extended.
I would ask the Minister of Agriculture to take note of my remarks and to see during the recess, whether it be short or long, what he can do in the matter in the interest of the farmers of northern 'New Brunswick. Farming is the basic industry of this country. In the early days of the session, I brought to the attention of the Government the necessity of readjusting the tariff so as to encourage the farming community before seeding commenced.
If that had been done, the labour situation would have been bettered and there would not be the unrest there is throughout the country to-day. To-day, again, I urge the Minister of Agriculture to take my remarks into consideration. He knows that I am with him in his desire to advance the interests of the farming industry, not only in the West but in the East as well.
I can assure him that the farmers of the East are in harmony with the farmers of the West in their aspirations and in their economic views, and there is no danger of a cleavage between the people of the East and the people of the West. The only place in Canada where there is a cleavage is in Central Canada, where the unrest prevails to-day. We hope before long that unrest will be settled.

If it did not get across it was probably due to the fact that they were obliged to keep some at home to cope with the rapid increase in prices as a result of commandeering. In Canada, under the regulations of the Food Board, limitations of price in butter was not fixed, but the margins of profit that could be taken by dealers in butter, whether cold storage, merchants or others, were fixed definitely by regulations under the Food Board.
These dealers were obliged to produce evidence that they were selling their butter within the margin of profit that had been allowed. In devising a method of meeting' the request of the British Food Ministry for supplies of butter the Canadian Food Board were faced with the problem of trying to secure that butter without abnormally increasing the price in Canada. The price of the butter in cold storage and in wholesale dealers' hands was already limited in this respect, that the margin of profit on it was limited, and since the butter had already gone into their hands at prices prevailing when they purchased, the selling price was practically established.
I want to assure the Committee, and particularly the hon. member for Chateauguay-Huntingdon, that this question was most carefully considered by myself, by the expert officials in the department and also by the Dairy Produce Commission., of whom I shall have a word to say in a moment. After we had gathered all the facts that were available we reached the conclusion that the better method in Canada would be to commandeer the production of butter from the factories in Canada for a stated period. An order was issued to that effect. The period covered five weeks' production. The price was fixed at Montreal, if my memory serves me, a.t a cent or a cent and a half a pound over what the Dairy Produce Commission had been paying theretofore.

I may be mistaken in that regard, but I do not think I am.
With regard to the importation of New Zealand butter into Canada. This butter has for years been coming into the Dominion. Owing to the lack of tonnage available from New Zealand to Great Britain, large surpluses of butter have accumulated in the former country, and the vessels that occasionally traded between British Columbia and the Australian Dominions carried the commodity. To-day New Zealand butter is being laid down in British Columbia at a cheaper rate than it can be produced in the Prairie Provinces, and I expect that condition will continue for some time to come. It is a case of having a large surplus in a country that has been unable to find its usual market, and the expansion of our own dairy trade not being what we might otherwise have expected.

WILSON:,,SUPPLY.,,,"Well, I would be in favour of knighting him if we had not voted against knighthood the other day. Many men in Canada have received knighthoods who do not deserve them as much as Mr. Wheeler, on his humble farm in Saskatchewan. His services have been a real benefit to the public. No man can make two blades of grass grow where formerly there was only one without doing a great benefit to his country. I have personal knowledge of this man's work. He came to Canada
from England in 1885, arriving at Moosejaw in the midst of those trying years when most people were discouraged from farming in Western Canada. From 1883 to 1887 there were almost continuous crop failures owing to the fact that, without irrigation, there was not enough moisture to produce vegetation. Wheeler, who was a young boy at the time, showed his interest in agriculture by first cultivating a garden in low-lying ground along a creek that ran through the town of Moosejaw. He carried the necessary water in a bucket and had a beautiful garden growing while no one else in the town was making any attempt to produce vegetables. He afterwards moved to the north country, and I have read you the result of his efforts along the line of the improvement of cereals. The least the Government could do is recognize this man's efforts by assisting him in some way, even if only to the extent of a grant of $1,000 or $1,500 a year, to put him beyond worry so far as his living is concerned and to enable him to devote all his thought and energy to the work in which he is specially interested and for which he is particularly well fitted, the development of our cereals. I strongly recommend that the minister give this matter his careful consideration.

My opinion is that it is only a question of years when that difficulty will be overcome because, with settlement and cultivation in Western Canada, we have largely overcome that same drawback in other districts. ' Many Americans who have come into that district and who have previously lived in somewhat similar, and possibly worse, districts, on the American side, claim that if the Government would change the seed to suit that district and use what is termed drouth-resisting varieties of seed, the farmers there would be able to grow more grain than they are now growing, and to make a success of farming. Are there any objections or obstacles to the use of these drouth-resisting varieties in that district? Is it impossible to sell grain of that variety in this country, and would farmers have to go to the United States to find a market if they went into the raising of grain of that kind ?

During the last two years quite a number of farmers have been growing these varieties in a small way and the results have been satisfactory. As to the market for this wheat, while it is not as valuable a wheat as the varieties we have been growing in Western Canada, it has excellent qualities for blending and mixing purposes, and I have no doubt if we grew it here, a satisfactory market could be found for it. The matter is now engaging the attention of the officials of the department.

This proposal that hi9 work should be recognized by the Federal Department of Agriculture was placed before me many months ago, and I gave considerable thought to it. There is, of course, one difficulty. In matters of Government, precedents are always dangerous to establish, and while I fully recognize the value of the work Mr. Wheeler has done, I have not been able up to the present to convince, myself that that recog-

nition should come from the Federal Department. Without in any way desiring to throw the responsibility elsewhere, I consider this a matter in which the Provincial Government might, to better advantage, give the recognition. In the realm of agriculture there are certain things that should be done by provincial department? of agriculture and certain other things that fall more naturally into the federal field Mr. Seager Wheeler has rendered excellent service to the grain growers of Western Canada; indeed, I know of no other individual farmer who has done more.
I should like to refer also to the remarks of the hon. member for Dufferin (Mr. Best) as regards the advisability and, indeed the necessity, of providing elevator facilities in Ontario. That is a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Commerce, which has charge of grain elevators. Some time ago quite a representative delegation waited on the Acting Minister of Trade and Commerce (Hon. A. K. Maclean) and urged upon him the advisability of building at once at some suitably located point in Ontario an elevator that would serve the purposes and needs set out by the hon. member for Dufferin. I believe the matter is now under the consideration of that department. I am not certain, but I think the Board of Grain Commissioners have been asked to make some report upon the advisability and utility of the proposal.

In New Brunswick some years ago the production of wheat was almost nil, until the Provincial Government took the matter in hand and assisted the farmers by 'bonusing small grist mills and distributing wheat seed. The province had practically abandoned the growing of wheat because of the lack of mills to grind it, but now the Provincial Government bonuses any one who will build a mill, and the result is that the production of wheat has increased by 300 to 400 per cent. The imills are doing very well, but there are not enough of them throughout the province. The bonus granted by the Provincial Government is not large enough, and I would therefore suggest that the Dominion Government join hands with the Provincial Government in encouraging the building of mills. In the county where I live you can go for fifty miles without seeing.a grist mill. That condition practically prohibits the raising of wheat, and the farmers might just as well take up some other work. I know a party in my own county who is willing to build a mill but has not the means, in view of the high cost of labour and materials. If the Government would bonus those who erect grist mills for grinding and cleaning the wheat, it would certainly encourage production and be of great advantage to the farmers. It is very necessary that the farmers should have clean wheat seed.

Some years ago I brought down and laid on the table of the House a sample of our Yukon wheat, and it created considerable interest. Afterwards I sent it to the seed analyst at the Experimental Station here, and he planted one hundred grains taken at random out of the sack. He was surprised, and I was delighted, to find that every one of those grains germinated, showing the vitality of the wheat we grow in the Yukon. There is a small agricultural station at Dawson, and my suggestion is that the minister select different types of wheat and have them grown there, to see if we cannot grow a type of wheat in the Yukon which will require a shorter season than any wheat grown in Saskatchewan, Alberta or Manitoba. I make that suggestion because I think there are some potentialities. We have so much sunlight in the Yukon in the summer that grain grows very rapidly, and the number of growing days would consequently be less than on the prairiesi.

I believe that if we had had an experimental farm there a good deal of expense could have been saved in connection with seed which we have been compelled for two seasons to send to that district to help the farmers. Last year the Government for this purpose withdrew a section of land that was put on the market for sale, and I would like the minister to consider the advisability of making a start in that section of the country in establishing an experimental farm.

Does that imply that the department has to do with cold storage cars, for instance? Does the department furnish cold storage for the transportation of fish and other perishable products which are carried from one place to another?
This matter is of the greatest importance The fishermen along the coasts of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island complain that while there are cold storage cars they are very poorly equipped and a very large percentage of fish and other products put into cold storage become unfit for human food before they reach their destination. It is necessary that fish should be kept cool and well iced from one stage of transportation to another until it is finally disposed. It has been complained that this matter is not attended to, and that the ice which is provided when the food leaves the point of shipment melts and is not renewed, the fish being destroyed. If this item is intended to cover [DOT]that particular phase of transportation and bring it within the scope of the Department of Agriculture, I would seriously press upon the minister the necessity of having the most complete system that can possibly be devised. Attention should be given not only to what forces itself upon the department, but every encouragement should he given to see that proper care is exercised in transportation with a view to obtaining the best and most profitable results. I have always thought-and I have brought the matter to the attention of the Govern-

ment several times-that in addition to provision for the proper care of food on transit in cars, there should be a suitable place of reception for the cars themselves when they reach their destination, some sort of cold storage shed where the car might be kept free from contamination until the freight is finally unloaded. These cars, I understand, are sometimes allowed to stand in the yard uncared for and in many cases valuable food such as fish decays and becomes unfit for consumption, and has to he thrown away. I am not quite sure that this comes within the purview of the Department of Agriculture, but the item seems to suggest that it does. If it does, I cannot too strongly urge upon the minister, and in any event upon the department which may deal with the matter, the great importance of this phase of the transportation question.

transportation of dairy products and fruits; it does not include fish, which is covered by an item in the Marine and Fisheries Department. Assistance is given to promote, and also by way of investigation to ascertain, the advantages to the producer from the use of proper refrigeration service in the transportation of these perishable commodities. I quite agree with the leader of the Opposition that the matter is one of very great importance. The advantage of cold storage and proper refrigeration, not only in rail bui in ocean transportation, has not, I venture to say, been fully recognized by the producers and the people generally. To assist in this work the Government, as has already been stated in the House on previous occasions, have made provision for the erection of a public cold storage plant on the harbour front of Montreal under the control of the Board of Harbour Commissioners for that port. Thi9 is to accomplish the very purpose which the leader of the Opposition refers to, namely, that commodities may have a suitable place of storage pending their further shipment. A portion of this grant is used for cow testing in the ordinary dairy herds. We have a staff of inspectors, and farmers are encouraged to test the milk production of their various animals. Very remarkable results have been obtained, and many farmers are weeding out unprofitable animals. There is also provision for cargo inspection in the shipment of perishable commodities overseas. There is a cargo inspection not only at the port of landing but also in the United Kingdom. Self-registering thermometers are used in the storage
compartments of the vessels, and complete records of temperatures are taken on the way across, which records are preserved in the files of the department. Further, there is some small provision for the drafting of plans of suitable dairy buildings. Very often inquiries are received from creameries and cheese factories and persons interested in the dairy business for suggestions as to suitable buildings to meet their requirements, and we are endeavouring to provide-for these necessities'. These are the matters that are mainly covered by the items included under this head. The development of our dairying industry in Canada is of. great importance. Great Britain imports about 500,000,000 pounds of butter annually and Canada supplies a very small portion of that, not more than a few million pounds. Britain's annual imports in eggs are also enormous, but Canada supplies only a few millions of dozens. In order to take full advantage of that market and to hold it we have to do two or three important things. First, we must secure the bost possible standard of quality in our product, and in the various activities of the department we are endeavouring to impress that fact on producers. Second,-and this is of equal importance-there must be proper facilities for shipment. If you ship a carload of butter from Montreal, Halifax or any other port and leave it standing on the wharf for a day or two in hot weather, deterioration sets in and the original quality of the butter can never be restored. Therefore, proper cold storage facilities and proper refrigeration service on vessels are of the greatest importance. The business of this branch generally is to study that field, and by experiment, investigation and inquiry, to discover the best possible methods that can be used to achieve these results.
Mr. McKENZIiE: Have we succeeded in Canada in obtaining a perfectly safe refrigerator car for the transportation of perishable food such as butter or fruit? The difficulty has been that although we have been reputed to have refrigerator cars suitable for the carrying of such goods, the cals used have been altogether inadequate, and great losses have been incurred by the use of them. Is there any experiment or improvement in this matter? Are we advancing any nearer the goal of our ambition to have a perfectly good refrigerator car?

Mr. LBGE'R: I would favour the idea of a Government-owned cold storage plant in the Maritime Provinces. With that I would urge the Government to have a good inspector to visit it frequently. If I am well informed, there are throughout Canada many cold storage warehouses, full of foodstuffs w.hich are held for higher prices. These cold storage warehouses should be visited by Government inspectors and the foodstuffs should be sold instead of being kept there to enhance prices. In that way the poor people of Canada would be benefited. These trusts or combines get together and fill up these warehouses with foodstuffs which they hold until the price goes up. As was said by an hon. member, a large quantity of foodstuffs was wasted in Montreal toy being held in cold storage for higher prices. The cost of living is getting so high that it is almost impossible for the poor people to live, and the Government should take steps to cause cold storage warenouses to -be emptied at a certain time of the year instead of being kept full of foodstuffs the year round, thus keeping the price up.

I understand the Department of Agriculture for Nova Scotia has been impressing upon the minister that some steps should be taken to erect at Halifax a cold storage plant somewhat similar to the one it is proposed to erect at Montreal. I have nothing to say against the building of a plant at Montreal,

but I was told that- one of the reasons why this cold storage plant was 'being erected at Montreal was to furnish facilities for the shipment of -chilled or other beef at all seasons of the year. The minister knows well that .shipping facilities at the port of Montreal are limited in season. For a considerable portion of the year that port is frozen up and vessels cannot come to or go away from it. Navigation is open in the harbour of Halifax 365 days of the year every year, and I am sure the same thing may be said of St. John, although not to the same easy extent as at Halifax. I do not know if there are any hon. members from New Brunswick here -who may criticise me if I say anything about the high tide difficulties of the St. John harbour. It is, however, open all the year round and ships can come to and go from it. If the Government have decided that it is proper to spend $1,000,000 for the purpose of erecting a cold storage plant to be auxiliary to transhipment across the Atlantic, that plant should be at a place which shipping can go to and depart from at all seasons. That is, I think, a strong argument in favour of such facilities being erected at the ports of Halifax and St. John, or, if not at both, at least at one of them. In- view of the fact that the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture -has put in its claim-and I have not heard that any particular claim was sent in from New Brunswick, although the one would require it just as much as the other-the minister should give some attention to the very legitimate request put forward. I understand the hon. member for Victoria city who has brought this matter to the attention of the minister is the president of a -certain association that has to deal with agricultural matters throughout the province.

I should like to point out to the minister an extraordinary thing that happened in Nova Scotia last year. The farmers in several counties such <as Pictou and Antigonish, the latter being exclusively a farming community, -are excellent farmers. They discovered that the hay crop was not up to standard last

year, and tliey were obliged to sell off hundreds of their live stock. They sold them to a gentleman who could do nothing with them but take them to a place where they could be slaughtered and put into cold storage. As there was no cold storage warehouse in the Maritime Provinces, those cattle were carried alive to Montreal or Toronto, slaughtered and the meat kept in cold storage all winter. The beef was then shipped back over nearly 1,500 miles of railroad to Nova Scotia and sold to our miners, lumbermen and other people.

those interested in the cattle trade are quite ready to build abattoirs if cold storage facilities were provided, but it is too expensive for them to erect a cold storage plant, and they are, therefore, looking to the Government to do so. It would be a good investment and a good policy for the Government to build such a plant. Does the minister intend in connection with the cold storage plant at Montreal, to provide a place where a car could be run in?
In order to do that, the lower story of the building would have to be made something like a railway yard. If that could be provided, it would certainly save a great deal of handling and re-handling of the contents. It might be that these facilities would be made use of only once in a while, but they would certainly 'be a splendid thing to have. I have particularly in mind what happens to our cars of fish from the Maritime Provinces. Friday is the big fish day in cities, and Thursday or early Friday morning is the best time to sell a car of fish in Montreal or Toronto. If the car happens to get there on Monday or Tuesday and has to stand in the yard during the early part of the week, when there is not so much demand for fish, my information is, the fish deteriorates and becomes unfit for sale, often resulting in a total loss. If there was a place in the cold storage building into which a car could be run and kept until its contents were disposed of, the shippers would feel secure against waste, and it would be a great encouragement to them. If this can be brought about, and the plans are not too far advanced, I would certainly suggest that limited accommodation, at all events, of
this character should be supplied in any cold storage warehouse that is to be erected.

I know that they had competent engineers making inquiries, and the Dairy and Cold Storage Commissioner, Mr. Rud-dick, accompanied one of the engineers to several cities in the United States to Iook over the most'up-to-date cold storage plants to be found in them. I have no doubt that as a result of their inquiries the most modern and up-to-date plant will be built in Montreal. I do not think the proposal advanced by the leader of the Opposition that a car should be run into the building, and the whole stored as a carload, is a practicable one. In fact, I think it would be very difficult, probably impossible, to carry out his suggestion. The most up-to-date facilities, however, will be provided for taking care of fish, fruit and any other perishable commodities that are shipped.
Now a word as to why Montreal wa3 selected. Montreal, of course, is a summer port, and it is during the summer months when temperatures are high that the need for cold storage is greatest. For that reason Montreal was selected as the initial point. There is already a cold storage plant in St. John, under the control of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Halifax is not as yet supplied with such a plant. I quite sympathize with the view expressed by the leader of the Opposition as to the necessity of proper abattoir and cold storage facilities in the province of Nova Scotia, or at any rate in one of the Maritime Provinces, and I presume Nova Scotia would be the most suitable, in order to encourage the development of the live stock industry in that part of Canada. It is quite true, as he has stated, that Nova Scotia cattle are at times shipped to Montreal for slaughter and the beef re-shipped for sale to the people of Nova Scotia. That on the face of it is an economic waste. At the request of the Provincial Department of Agriculture for Nova Scotia we have sent some of our officials to that province to make, in conjunction with the provincial officials, a survey of the whole situation with a view to ascertaining the best line of action to follow.

If we can hope to export cattle to the United States and hold that market, and if the embargo is removed from cattle going to Great Britain and we desire to ship cattle there, we must be sure that we send only healthy animals to those two markets; otherwise we cannot expect to retain them. The accredited herd system will give the advantage to the herd that is kept clean, and I sincerely hope that the breeders of the country will avail themselves of this opportunity to the fullest extent. I desire to congratulate the Health of animals Branch of the department on the work they have accomplished during the past few years. On several occasions we have had very serious outbreaks of infectious and contagious diseases immediately along the boundary line, and in nearly all cases none of the diseases have entered Canada., By preventing disease in that way through a close system of inspection we have been saved the loss of millions of dollars, and when we consider the small appropriation-I see there is an increase to a certain extent this year- and compare that appropriation with the

enormous value of the live stock in Canada, something between one and one and a half billions of dollars, it will be recognized that a very valuable work is being accomplished by this branch of the Department of Agriculture at a nominal cost.

Dealing with the large number of farmers to whom I would have to give literature T realized that a limited quantity would be only a source of embarrassment to me.

It is a pity that tons of this material should be wasted

from year to year, and I strongly urge upon the minister that the officers who have charge of this branch should acquaint themselves with the names and addresses of the farmers from coast to coast. It is a large undertaking, but they can very readily get this information by applying to the agricultural societies in the several provinces. In this way they would get at least 75 or 80 per cent of the names of the farmers and as they have no postage to pay it would be a comparatively simple matter to send literature to the farmers. I wish to impress upon the minister the desirability of seeing that this information reaches those whom it will benefit. Undoubtedly it would be useful and might stimulate the farmer to greater efforts in the way of increased production, besides giving him new ideas. At all events it would impress him with the idea that the department is taking an interest in him and has his prosperity at heart. I know that only very few farmers of Canada receive any literature from the department. I would like to see literature relating to the farm finding its way into more houses and into the hands of more farmers than at present, for it would certainly have beneficial results.

I have found in my experience of several years that the best results are always obtained when the person who desires literature makes application for it in some form or other. Very often you get names from such a source as the voters' lists, and send circulars or pamphlets to the addresses there given, with the result that a large percentage of the literature thus sent finds its way into the waste basket. The evidence of interest on the part of the person applying for literature and the best guarantee that he will make proper rise of it when he gets it, is the fact that he goes to the trouble of applying for it. However, I entirely agree with the leader of the Opposition as to the importance of the matter.

with the minister as to the way in which this matter should be attended to. Possibly his view is one way of looking at it, but it seems to suggest the argument that we should not send missionaries to the distant islands and remote parts of the earth until they have made application for

some one to go and preach to them the gospel of the Nazarene. That is not the way in which the gospel is propagated. We send missionaries to the heathen and wake him up to the necessity of looking to the salvation of his soul, and in like manner we should send to the farmers, who need the information that we can give them, such literature as will be of benefit to them. If we did this we would create a desire on their part for more and more information, and applications would then be made in abundance. In many departments of life we are content to keep in the old rut, and if we do not assimilate new ideas we are apt to rest content with what was done by our grandfathers and fathers. The aim of the department should be to create a new interest in farming and they should not spare a few more dollars in putting necessary pamphlets and other useful records within the reach of the farmers if by so doing they can encourage them and stimulate an interest in rural life in Canada.

There are, of course, large farmers and wealthy people who ""play the market"" to some extent in connection with stock at this time.

be placed within reach of the ordinary farmers of the country without their paying such high prices as are charged? The Government may perhaps be taking some action along this line at present.

There is need of further steps in this direction because I know that our cattle in many agricultural sections of 'the island of Cape Breton are not as good as they were twenty-five or thirty years ago.

The federal Department of Agriculture does give specific assistance towards the promotion of the better breeding of live stock of all kinds. As far as cattle, sheep, and swine are concerned, it, is given in this way: Provision is, made for the supplying of pure-bred sires in each of these classes to associations of farmers that organize themselves and conform to certain regulations with which compliance is easy. The total number of sires that have been distributed in Canada is over two thousand. In other words, there were about two thousand of these associations in existence last year. Of that number, I am sorry to say, there were only twenty-nine in the province of Nova Scotia. The Department of Agriculture in that province carries on a somewhat similar work, but I am not at the moment able to give information as to the extent to which it does so, or as to the degree of success it has encountered. A very considerable portion of the expenditure contemplated by this vote is for this purpose. In the case of horses a percentage of the service fee is paid by the department, where the association is regularly formed, and its application has been regularly placed with the department. In all these cases as careful attention as possible is given to the securing of sound sires of the best quality available. There is no disguising the fact, however, that the general standard of our live stock, in cattle particularly,-in the beef typeu at any rate, -in Canada, is not as high as it might be. However, I believe that with .the general spread of knowledge and the insistence on the need of improvement, we will make greater progress in the future than we have

made in the past. We very frequently find, as every hon. member knows, farmers who are very largely indifferent to the type of animals that they have. They do not seem to realize as clearly as they should that it costs as much and even more to raise a scrub animal than it does to prodluce stock of a good type.

I believe the money asked for here will be well spent in improving the live stock of our country, but I think a little leniency or consideration should have been given to the associations referred to. I have had my attention drawn particularly to the case of one association where the secretary was ill at the time the application should have been forwarded. I brought this fact before the department, but no consideration was given to the case. I think that was very unfair indeed. These men had formed an association at considerable cost to themselves, but owing to the fact that the secretary was ill at the time the application should have gone in, it was somewhat late in reaching the department, and it was declined. Now the intention of this vote toeing to help the farmers, there should have been a certain amount of leniency displayed in that particular case-in fact two instances of the kind were brought to my notice. Of course, if there are regulations governing this matter, they should be observed, but in such cases as I am referring to, the fact that delay in making the application was caused by illness should have been taken into consideration.
son for the delay, if I remember rightly, was the prevalence of influenza in the district concerned. But it is important that regulations, particularly in governmental administration, should be lived up to. When a department establishes a definite regulation for the governance of its work and that regulation is not adhered to, that moment the department is in difficulty. The regulation which the hon. gentleman criticises provides that these applications must be lodged with the department prior to April 1; in the case to which he refers the application came in ten days or two weeks late. Fully fifty similar applications came in after the first of April, running all the way from one to three days late up to five weeks late. If you admit one and refuse another, where are you going to draw the line? If you admit them all, what is the use of the regulation? If we violate the regulation for one, we must violate it for all, or we shall be charged with discrimination, favoritism, political pull and all the other things of a like nature. While I regret to disappoint my hon. friend, nevertheless I am sure that on reflection he will see the reasonableness of the position taken by the department in the matter.

as I stated a moment ago, the Regina fair last year had a surplus of $22,000 over and above their expenses.

I do not care whether the grant is $5 or $500, but I want all the B class fairs to be on the same footing. Yorktown and Prince Albert for instance, which did not comply with the regulations received the grant, while others did not. All I am asking for is a square deal.
Mr. CRERAR. If the fairs which the hon. member speaks for spent $3,600 last year in utility prizes they will participate in the grant this year. We have stretched the limit I think to the utmost. As to the relative merits of A and B class fairs, I dare say there are not a few hon. members in this House who would argue that the A class were more beneficial to the community than the B class. In the A class fairs the prize lists are larger, they have a bigger exhibition of livestock, and a great many more people patronize these fairs because they are held in the larger centres. The Toronto Fair, for instance, which runs for two weeks, undoubtedly attracts a great many more people than a fair in a little town of 2,000 people that runs for only three days. The policy of the Department may be open to criticism, but I am sure that the officials of the Department have studied the matter earnestly and honestly, with a view to getting the maximum of results for the money expended. I can assure the hon. member for Swift Current that it is not in the interest of any person in the department that B class fairs should
be discriminated against in favour of A class.

It is quite apparent that such an exhibition which is able to finance itself should be able to concede a little bit to the pioneer districts in Western Canada, and some of the money might profitably go there.

I was very much impressed by the address to-night by the hon. member for Victoria (Mr. Tolmie), and I was thinking that if some hon. gentlemen like himself or some other person equally informed and gifted were travelling through the farming districts and telling the farmers the advantages of pure bred stock very satisfac-

tory results would accrue. I am not aware that any organized or proper effort is being made in the part of the country from which I come either by the local Agricultural Department or by this department to bring this education home to the farmers and to invite them to organize and take advantage of tne opportunities which the department offers to them.
I am sure that there are hundreds and thousands of people who are making their living as farmers to whose attention the advantage of having proper stock and the way in which they can get it has now been forcibly brought. If no effort has been made hitherto to have a proper organization along those lines and a campaign of education, I would suggest to the minister that he should have a proper arrangement with the agriculture departments of the different provinces so that this campaign of education may be carried on. There is such a thing, no doubt, as a duplicating and overlapping of effort. We have agricultural societies in Nova Scotia under the supervision and control of the local legislature which do fairly good work, but we must push this work if we are to produce the results necessary to reach the high-water mark in regard to it. I am particularly pleased with the information which the hon. member for Victoria city has given us and I trust the Department of Agriculture will be able to present this matter to the people in such a way as to reach parts of the country that have not so far taken advantage of their opportunities. I am not finding fault with the department, because they seem to be doing good worx but I would like to go one step farther and press home upon the farmers the advisability of taking advantages of the opportunities which are made available t-o them through the department.

is for the purpose of encouraging the production of farm and garden crops. There is another method of encouraging the production of farm and garden crops which is not indicated fully in the description as contained in this item, and tha't is to find a market for that which has been produced. About a month ago I took the opportunity of asking the then Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) for information regarding some correspondence I had from a citizen living in the constituency that I

have the honour to represent. The Acting Prime Minister stated then that the Government had supplied altogether $80,000,000 to help in the marketing of Canadian wheat and that they were arranging, if my memory serves me aright, a credit of $90,000,000 additional for the same purpose. ' But he failed to explain why it was that any farmer found it difficult to find a market for his wheat and intimated that the wheat was not of proper grade. I have had since then considerable .correspondence from a number of farmers in the same section, as well as a number of millers, and they all have the same story to tell, that there is a large quantity of 11 p.m. wheat, fully twenty per cent of last year's crop, still in the hands of farmers. They all say that they cannot find a market for it. It may be difficult for a man like the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) or the Minister of Agriculture to understand that, and yet that is the story that comes to me from the riding of South Renfrew. The hon. member for Chateauguay-Huntingdon (Mr. Robb) .made an inquiry regarding the same subject a few days ago and the Minister of Finance informed him then that the Government were negotiating with the Greek Government for the disposal of 15,000,000 or 20,000,000 bushels of wheat. Notwithstanding this information, I am still confronted with the proposition that the farmers in South Renfrew have that quantity of wheat on their hands and are not able to dispose of it. Just a couple of days ago I received a letter from the proprietors of the Killaloe Roller Mills Company. This was sent in response to an inquiry made by me, and they informed me that there are at least ten . or twelve cars of wheat within hauling distance of their mill but that owing to the fact that they are unable to find a market for their flour they cannot purchase this wheat. The consequence is that this wheat will remain on the farmers' hands. The farmers are anxious' because, as I understand, the guaranteed price for wheat will be withdrawn and the farmers with 18,000 or 20,000 bushels of wheat in one little section of South Renfrew will be left with this wheat on their hands. There are other sections in the same position, and they naturally view the situation with considerable anxiety. I rise to discuss this issue on this item because it is my opinion that if the Government and department will find a market for that wheat they will certainly encourage production. These men were induced to in-

crease their acreage during the past two years for war purposes. In the last two years they increased their production by fifty per cent. That is the opinion of the several milling concerns in the riding. A market was held out to them as an inducement and as a result of that inducement there was increased acreage and increased production. If you want farmers to increase production no better method can be adopted than to insure a market for what they produce. Here is -the case as I find it not only in that one section of my constituency but in several other sections as well. They have the wheat on hand but no market. They want me to find out what the Government are going to do about this situation.
I would like to know the exact attitude of the Government in regard to the disposition of wheat which is in the hands of farmers at the present time, particularly in South Renfrew, in which I am naturally most interested. Will the Government undertake to find a market for that wheat at the guaranteed price? Should not the farmers expect the Government to take action along definite lines? Will the Government undertake to purchase the wheat to fill the contracts referred to a couple of days ago by the Minister of Finance? Will the hen. gentleman say that this wheat will be purchased for that purpose?

in that section. And I am informed by one of the millers that the quality of the wheat sold there is first-class in every particular.
1 might further state that this miller wrote to the department, and I have the letter which he received in reply. It is certainly not very encouraging. With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I will read it. It 'is dated April the 24th, and is as follows:
Dear Sirs,-I have your letter of April 18th, but regret to state that there is very little in formation I can give you, except that conditions have changed materially during the past year The great shortage of ocean steamships has led to congestion in many parts of the world. An arrangement was entered into some time ago with the British Government by which the Wheat Export Company were to take the exportable surplus of the 1918 crop on the -basis of the fixed prices. The British Government, however, has -been unable to purchase the quantity at first thought necessary in view of the congestion at British ports and the very large quantity of wheat in the United Kingdom, larger quantities in fact than at any time since the outbreak of war. The whole question of the marketing of the Canadian wheat and flour is now engaging the attention of the Government. It is a difficult problem, however, in view of the present world wide conditions. Apparently matters can only adjust themselves.
It will be seen that this letter suggests no way out of the difficulty, and I would like to know if it is not possible for the Govern-men to assist the section of the country referred to in this respect.

I certainly think it is, if the minister is to make a statement of the Government's policy in regard to pensions.
Hon. NEWTON W. ROWELL (President of the Council): If this were a statement of the Government's policy I would at once concur in my hon. friend's suggestion. But the policy of the Government with regard to pensions, as well as the policy of the Pensions Committee, will come up for consideration when the Pensions Committee's Report is presented, which report I think will be in shape for presentation next week. The Pensions Committee has practically completed its work, and its report will then come up together with a Bill which the committee is drafting for submission to the House. All questions of policy will come up for review when the Bill is being considered. This is simply a vote of the estimated amount required on the basis of the existing pension schedule. If the Pensions Committee recommends some increases, as will likely be the case, that will involve a supplementary estimate being brought down; the whole question will come up for very full consideration when we have the committee's report before us, and the Pensions Bill which will have to be considered section by section. I thought, therefore, I would make simply a very brief statement, [Air. Pedlow.]
giving an outline of the present position of affairs. This item might then be permitted to pass, and we could discuss the whole question of policy when we come to deal with the report of the Pensions Committee.
This is simply an estimate based on a certain number of estimated pensioners- taking the figures for last year, plus the estimated number of pensions for the coming year. The total casualties in the Canadian Expeditionary Force .up to 8th of May of the present year, were 212,182. Of that number there were either killed or died of wounds or disease 63,347, and the total number of wounded was 148,835. That gives us the total possible pension claims up to date, and very few could subsequently arise; of course, some further claims may be presented before demobilization is completed. Taking first the killed, that is 63,347, it is estimated that no pension will be applied for in the case of approximately fifteen per cent of that number. That is there will be fifteen per cent with no dependents who would be entitled to claim any pension, and the Pension Board estimates that the total number of pensions which will probably be granted in respect of men killed in action or that have died of wounds will be 53,854-at least that is the total number in respect of which claim might be made to come within the provisions of the pension regulations. Now, so far 22,612 of these cases have come up for consideration by the Pensions Board, which is not quite one-half of the possible pension claimants in the case of those killed. Of the 22,612 claims which have come up for consideration and been dealt with, 16,959 have been allowed, and 5,653 have been refused on the ground that they did not come within the provisions of the pension regulations. That leaves 31,233 yet to be dealt with if claims are presented, and if they are disposed of on the same basis. In other words, if the percentage of claims that should be allowed is the same in the future as in the past, experience has shown it would come to 23,425 more pensions to be allowed in respect of those who have been killed in action or who have died of wounds. With that as a basis the Board of Pension Commissioners is able to estimate the total amount payable to dependents of those killed in action or who have died of wounds, and it is on that basis that that part of the present estimate is made up.
Then, take the case of disabilities. I gave the total number of wounded as 148,835. A number were wounded more than once and

returned to the firing line. It is impossible, of course, until all claims are in, to ascertain accurately how many have been wounded more than once. But for the purpose of this estimate the Board of Pensions Commissioners have put down the number at five per cent of the total, or 7,441, leaving 141,394 as the number of cases or disabilities for which claims might possibly he made. Of these, 71,834, about fifty per cent, have already been dealt with, and of the 71,834, 53,876 have been allowed and 17,958 disallowed, as not coming within the provisions of the pension regulations. If the remaining applications or possible applications are disposed of on the same basis, we would have 52,170 additional pensioners on the ground of disability. This estimate is based on the assumption that we shall have that additional number and that the average amount payable in case of disability will be the same in the new cases as in the cases already allowed. On that basis, the total estimated Pension Bill of the Dominion when all cases are disposed of will be $32,814,391, assuming that no increase is made in our pension schedule and that no change is made in the regulations so as to bring in cases that are now excluded. Of that amount, it is estimated that we shall require this year the amount mentioned in the Estimate. As a number of men have not been discharged from the army and the right to pension has not yet arisen, the full amount will not be required this year; it is estimated that $28,000,000 will cover the pension bill for this year on the basis of the present schedule of disabilities. If the Pension Committee recommends and the House concurs in some increase in the pension schedules, a Supplementary Estimate will be brought down to cover that estimated increase. That, in brief, is the basis of the expenditure under this vote of $28,000,000. If any further information is desired I shall be glad to give it as we proceed.

It is the Pensions Board that deals with all these matters, and the Board is the final authority in connection with them under regulations passed by this House. I understand, however, that the Pension Board states that the facts are somewhat as follows: That on 4th October the case came to the attention of the Board of Pension Commissioners and that on the fifth of October Mr. Taylor was examined and recommended for treatment, and he was granted treatment under the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment on the 7th October. For reasons which probably Mr. Taylor considered sufficient but which were not explained, he discontinued the treatment of his own volition within a few days after he was recommended for it. I should point out to the committee that those receiving treatment are on pay and allowance during the whole period of the treatment, and if a man is married his wife gets a sum similar to the separation allowance. It is quite true, as the hon. member has suggested, that there was some mistake in notifying the Pensions Board by the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, and his pension was not resumed as it should have been when he discontinued the treatment. According to the regulations while a man is receiving treatment, if he is a pensioner, he draws pay and allowance paid by the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment and his pension is discontinued. When he ceases treatment, his pension is resumed, and under the conditions there was a holding over of the pensiofi and the man has in that sense a

grievance and ground for complaint because of the mistake made in reference to notification to the Board of Pension Commissioners. I understand the situation is at present that he has been asked to go to Winnipeg for further examination, and if treatment is recommended, for treatment. Winnipeg is a neurological centre; they have there experts who can provide the treatment. The information which the Board of Pension Commissioners has is that this is a neurological case; and that treatment of that kind is necessary and that, if applied, will restore the man to health and should give him the use of his limbs, and, therefore, that man should, they think, go to Winnipeg to take the treatment. The expense to Winnipeg is paid, and if he takes the treatment he receives pay and allowance. That is the information I have received. I have, of course, no power to give the assurance for which tne hon. member asks. The Government has no such power under the regulations adopted which were considered wise at the time in order to prevent any question of politics interfering. The rules adopted, recommended by the Pension Committee, expressly provide that the decision of the Board of Pension Commissioners is final. There is no appeal to the Government and the Government has no right to override their decision. I will, however, personally look into this matter to see if there appears to be a grievance Or miscarriage of justice, with a view to urging the board to remedy any injury if one appears to have been inflicted. That is as far as I can go, because this is a case in which the decision of the board is final.

There was an approach towards an agreement, but no agreement was finally

reached. A great many proposals on one side and the other were put forward, and the final result, about seven o'clock in the evening, was that the employers made a proposal in writing which, I think, was furnished to the press, and which was to be submitted by the representatives of the labour organizations to the men in Toronto. I believe it was so presented, but the men did not see fit to accept it. The chief question under discussion yesterday was the granting of a week of forty-four hours, and it was upon that question that the employers finally decided to offer arbitration. We endeavoured to have the offer accompanied with some other conditions which possibly might have made it more acceptable, but it was presented finally in the form which has been made public.

Is that not a good rule to apply to the judges? L notice that, by legislation of Ontario, there is to be a considerable reduction in the number of County Court judges in that province. In this case we are proposing to increase the number of judges in British Columbia. I have not sufficient knowledge of British Columbia to offer an opinion in the matter, but it seems odd that at a time when Ontario is cutting down the number of its judges British Columbia finds it necessary to make an increase. I know the difficulty that arises owing to the jurisdiction of the provinces in the matter of the courts and the fact that the Dominion has to provide the judges and pay the bills. I know this is a layman's view and that laymen ought not to say much about these things; but there is a wide-spread opinion that the rule of having fewer officials and paying them better is a good one to apply to the judges as well as to other branches of the public service.

understands the necessity for greater and more scientific agricultural production in the future. All the financial and economic authorities who have lately given their views as regards present conditions in Canada have insisted on the fact that what is needed is greater production The chief industry of Canada is above all farming. This is a great farming community and the more we can attract the people to

country life the more wo shall do in the way of restoring the country to a basis of sound economy and prosperity. There must be more production along scientific lines. Although I am not much over the fifty-year mark, there has been in my day and generation quite a change in the method of agriculture. I shall not speak for other sections of the country, but the section with which I am most familiar. Even in the constituency of Gaspe, where the people are fishermen and farmers simultaneously, I have noticed during the last twenty years a change for the better in agricultural methods. This, I am pleased to say, is due in a large degree to the very progressive education given our farmers by the Department of Agriculture in Quebec, and also, I must say, by the officials of the Department of Agriculture at Ottawa. I do not know how the other provinces regard the lectures given to farmers, but speaking for my constituency of Gaspe I can say that the people are always pleased to meet the lecturers sent by .the Department of Agriculture and that they quietly, without any great demonstration, adopt the methods suggested by the lecturers. In addition to this, the small experimental farms, not to speak of the largest, have produced the best results. If there is one expenditure to which the minister should commit himself more in the future, it is for the multiplication of these small farms.
I have in my mind especially the recommendations made by Professor Robertson in the report of the Commission on Technical Education. These latter recommendations have been published in pamphlet form and I have found them very instructive indeed. If I had any advice to offer my hon. friend it would be to try and live up to the recommendations made by Professor Robertson. I must compliment the Department of Agriculture in Ottawa upon having given to the district to which I belong politically-the district of Quebec- the magnificent experimental farm located in the constituency of my hon. friend from Kamouraska (Mr. Lapointe). The agricultural school at St. Anne de la Pocatiere is a Quebec institution and a very progressive one, but, since its establishment at the request of my hon. friend from Kamouraska, the Government has supplemented the work of that school by the establishment of an experimental farm and, following the establishment of the farm, there have been exhibitions every year which would be of interest even to the farmers of the other provinces of Canada.

While I am in a laudatory mood, might I not congratulate sincerely the Minister of Agriculture upon the appointment which he has made of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture. I must be frank, sincere and honest in my appreciation of the good work accomplished by the Department of Agriculture. The farmers who sit in this House and the farmers in the country-at least the farmers in our part of the country- appreciate the great work which was done some years ago by the Hon. Sydney Fisher. He changed completely the complexion of the department and gave to it a very high standing in the country. The Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Crerar) enjoys to a large degree the confidence of the public because, as we know, he is a farmer and he is proud of it. In the appointment of his officials he has done the right thing in making them without regard to political considerations. He has appointed Mr. Grisdale and I have noticed that in the press and on both sides of politics that appointment has been hailed as a progressive step. Mr. Grisdale has had a long experience. He is known throughout Canada. He is a modest, humble official but stern and sturdy in the discharge of his official duties. He has another great advantage which we cannot ignore. He speaks both languages fluently. How can you expect to reach the different farming communities in the different provinces if the officers of the department cannot be understood in the literature which they send out to every section of the country or in the lectures which they deliver to their farming audiences? By appointing Mr. Grisdale you have appointed the best officer in the department to a position which he will fill, we know, with great profit to the country. Besides, any farmer from my province can come to him, speak in his own language and be answered and understood as if he were speaking to one of his own fellow countrymen. I congratulate my hon. friend on this appointment. I hope that under Mr. Grisdale the department will continue the traditions established by the predecessor of my hon. friend the Hon. Sydney Fisher, who was really the friend of the farmer.

I am not much of a connoisseur in cheese, if I might apply the term to that article, but I may say that we are making, for instance, at the Central Experimental Farm in this city, one of the best fancy cheeses produced in America. The cheeses to which the hon. gentleman alludes are imported from Europe; some people have a fancy for eating Swiss, Dutch, or Canadian cheese, as the case may be. Personally, I have never been able to see very much difference between them.

Nevertheless, an embargo was placed upon Canadian cattle, and it has remained in force ever since, despite the efforts that have been made to have it removed.

But it makes no difference. These gentlemen, taking advantage of what they knew was going to happen, wired to their agents in Western Canada and bought up all the butter held by the factories in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and partly in Alberta, before the advance in price. Immediately in the United States prices began to go up. Milk and cream were on the free list, and the farmers along the international line and quite a distance away from the line discovered that they could sell their milk in the United States at $3.55 on a 3 per cent butter-fat basis, which worked out at .about $4.05 for extra good milk per 100 pounds. As against that, the price at which it was commandeered in Canada would give them from $1.75 to $2.05 and very naturally the flow of milk started to the United States. When the Government discovered this they placed an embargo on milk and cream, going into the United States, so that .this condition obtained for the month of October and part of November, and if I mistake not it was February before the embargo was totally raised. My friends from the western provinces who year in and year out have told us of the greater prices that have prevailed in the	Minneapolis market for wheat
can	very well	understand how the
eastern dairyman felt when he discovered that his neighbour across the line was receiving from $1 to $1.50 per 100 pounds more for milk than he was. When the farmer discovered that he could not ship his milk or cream owing to the embargo he decided to sell his cow, and that largely explains the great increase in the exports in cattle into the United States from all parts of Canada, and explains also why the cities to-day are suffering, or at any rate did suffer all winter.

In respect of the restrictions on the exportation of milk and other products to the United States, what was the situation that existed in August last, at a time when the struggle between the German armies and the Allies had reached its greatest intensity in Europe? The British people were practically face to face with a situation where butter could not be secured, and their rations were down to half an ounce per person per week. They requested the food Administrations of the United States and Canada to take some action that would relieve them in this respect. It was essential that the morale of the British and French people should be kept at its highest possible point at that time, and as a result cf their request the United States Food Administration commandeered outright, if my memory is correct, 60 per cent of the butter supplies then in cold storage in the United States. Coupled with this question is also the matter of the price of the article at home. The United States commandeered supplies in stock without limitations as to prices, and the result was that within a few weeks, due to the withdrawal from consumption of

this large quantity of butter, prices in the United States rapidly rose until they advanced some 12 to 18 cents per pound over what they had previously been.
Mr. MoMASTER:	The hon. member for
Chateauguay-Huntingdon (Mr. Robb) stated that this butter that was commandeered by the American Government did not get across, or at least not all of it.

The sowing of seed which contains wild seeds not only curtails the amount of the grain produced, but leaves the land in a wild state and gives rise to much additional work and trouble for years to come. As the machinery for properly cleaning grain costs a good deal of money, it is beyond the reach of the average farmer. It is up to the minister, therefore, to see that the people of Ontario are provided with an elevator at some convenient place, where they may store their grain and have it re-cl6aned and dried if necessary. I think I am not going beyond the truth when I say that had we had an elevator in some convenient place in Ontario last year half of its cost would have been made up by the saving of the beans that were lost in that province because of the lack of facilities for properly cleaning them. In the eastern part of the province the condition is not so bad, because Montreal is within easy reach. But the farmers lost three or four cents a bushel on the grain shipped by rail from Toronto to Montreal; it was inspected when it arrived there and they had to take what they could get for it. i am not much in favour of every-

thing going to the large centres, but if this grain could be re-cleaned properly, say at Toronto, where there are good railway facilities, and if there was proper elevator accommodation, with all the necessary machinery for cleaning, thousands of dollars would be saved for the people of Ontario. Some years ago much seed wheat was shipped out of Ontario to Western Canada. A good deal of that wheat was not properly cleaned and was not in proper condition when it was sent out. During the past winter thousands of bushels of oats have been shipped from Ontario to Western Canada for seed. The farmers received from sixty to seventy cents a bushel for those oats, whereas if the oats had been cleaned they could have got from seventy-five to eighty cents a bushel. The farmers were losing from five to ten cents a bushel on those oats, because cleaning would cost only a few cents a bushel. The Government has received deputations asking that an elevator be established in some convenient place in Ontario, and I hope the minister will see that we have one built for the convenience and benefit of the farmers. I believe the outlay would be paid for almost every year.

time, when the hon. Secretary of 'State (Mr. Burrell) was Minister of Agriculture, we used to discuss the advisability of establishing not altogether demonstration farms but small farms for the development of agriculture. The idea was that some of the $10,000,000 set apart for the development of the industry could be utilized in 'buying small farms in the neighbourhood of industrial centres, say, for instance, near the steel works in the county from which I come, where there are thousands of farmers' sons, and men from Ireland, England and Scotland who make marvellous developments of little bits of land about their houses. I-t was thought that if the Government could establish thirty or forty or even twenty small farms of between twenty-five and forty acres each, with house and barn, and give a small start in the way of developing these farms, and then sell them, men would be very anxious and willing to go in for the scheme. The idea has been developed in the West by the Canadian Pacific Railway. I understand they have built houses on certain sections of land; and they sell not only the bare land but the houses and barns and some equipment. In that way they have given a great boom to agriculture in that part of the country. We have in Nova Scotia millions of acres that are unoccupied, and it is not unusual to find a man owning four or five hundred acres and living on it with his wife, being able to scratch a bare living out of perhaps five per cent of the land. That land to which I refer could be used to great advantage if people could be found to take an interest in agriculture, and I am sure the Government would lose no money if they undertook this project. All they need is courage and enterprise, and they would find these little farms would be successful and would give a fresh impetus to agriculture. It was thought in the early days that the thing would be practicable, and there was some co-operation between the honourable gentleman (Mr. Burrell) and the Minister of Agriculture for Nova Scotia. Some start was made in the buying of old farms but the matter was not looked after properly and nothing of importance has really been done. What is absolutely e* sential for the development of the country is that it shall be a place in which the ordinary man can live in comfort, and the only way in which that can be achieved is to encourage the farmer to produce and enable him to sell at reasonable prices. The only advantage to the farmer is the profit he makes, and if he can make a large
profit it is better for the country. He may make a fair profit on a small quantity, but if he can make a proportionate profit on large quantities of produce there is a beneficial result all round. It is absolutely necessary for the Department of Agriculture to make a departure from the rut in which we have been moving for the last twenty-five years, and to show what can be done along these lines. I have no particular line to indicate to the minister, but I have suggested what might be done in the neighbourhood of large centres. I have spoken of Cape Breton because I know men there who are ready to take hold of these little farms if they are put within their reach. They have not the means themselves to buy lands and put up houses, but if they were helped up to that stage they would jump at the proposition. The market is there and they could sell their produce, and there are young men from the Old Country who are enterprising enough to do very well if they were given a start. Another thing I might point out is the desirability of encouraging the extension of tram cars that are in touch with agricultural land so as to encourage the farmer. Companies might be encouraged to push their lines into the country. These things cost money, but the minister in charge of the department must have courage to depart from the old line and not hesitate to spend money abundantly so long as good results can be obtained. We want to make 'Canada produce something proportionate to its capacity for production.
Mr. iLEiMIEUX: In connection with the distribution of literature, I have noticed that literature is printed in both languages and when any one applies to the department he can get either French or English copies. I want to inform the minister-and this can be confirmed by the deputy minister-that the best agent of the department in my province is the cure, who is generally the honorary president and sometimes the secretary of what we call the Circles Agricoles. There is one in every county, and sometimes one in every parish, and in the pulpit on nearly every 'Sunday of the year in these rural districts the cure will spend a portion of his time speaking to the farmers on agricultural matters.
I would like my hon. friend to send the literature which is issued by the department in French-not all, but the most essential bulletins-to the cures of the province of Quebec, so as to secure their devotion to the cause. Because the great issue of the day is the necessity of getting our

people back to the land and improving living conditions in the rural districts. I have offered these remarks now because unfortunately, I shall not be able to be present this evening.
Mr. 'CRERAR:	I can say to the hon.
gentleman that the suggestion which he has made will be acted upon.

This farm at Spirit Lake is in my constituency, in the far north. There is another farm at Kapuskasing, only a few miles away; one is in Quebec and the other is in Ontario. Something like $80,000 a year is being spent on these farms-an extraordinarily large amount. Moreover, the expenditure on the Experimental Farm at Ottawa seems to be entirely out of proportion to the results that are being obtained. The minister tells us that they developed a kind of wheat there some years ago. The older members of the House tell me, however, that that argument has been practically worked to death here; that seems to be the only explanation each year for increasing the expenditure. Does the minister not think that a better system might be worked out by distributing smaller farms throughout the country and doing the



work on a purely business basis in the different provinces? These large farms in Ottawa and at other points are purely experimental farms. A demonstration farm is quite different from an experimental farm. A demonstration farm would show the farmers in the community how to improve their seed, their stock, and their conditions generally; the experimental farm would seem to make experiments from which the independent farmer can obtain no profit. Does not the minister think that this money could be more profitably expended on demonstration farms?

In every country that is making any effort to secure sound agricultural development, experimental farms and stations and demonstration stations are maintained.
As to the increase which the hon. member criticises, the matter resolves itself simply into this, that if we are to pay the increased cost of operation, such as the increase in wages and the higher cost of material, due to causes over which the Department of Agriculture has no control, then, if we are to keep the vote at the same amount as last year, we shall have to cut down the efficiency of the farms, and that would not be a wise move nor justified in any way. The development of agriculture in every country in the world is becoming more and more dependent upon the application of sound, scientific methods, not only in respect to methods of cultivation as to cereals, fruits and vegetables, but in the field of animal husbandry, which is of immense importance. For instance, as was pointed out this afternoon, the beef animals produced in Canada are inferior to those produced in the Argentine and in the United States. Experiments which are being carried on at several stations and farms, demonstrate conclusively the advantages of producing higher class animals at practically the same or even slightly lower cost than inferior animals. Those facts are published, and they are also made known to those who visit the farms and personally acquaint themselves with the experiments that are being carried on. We have passed the time when the utility and advantages of experimental farms and stations can be successfully challenged. It is, perhaps, an open question as to what is the best method of carrying on the work. I said .this afternoon, and I will repeat it 
now for the information of the hon. member, that from the information we are gathering it seems that the establishment of illustration farms will probably prove the most effective method of bringing the farmers closely and directly in touch with the advantages of the work that is being carried on-.

Feeding experiments in cattle have been carried out not only at the Central Experimental Farm but at branch farms, to determine what profit there is to the individual carrying on work along the same line, and some very interesting results have been found. I am safe in saying that hundreds of thousands of bulletins dealing with these various matters are distributed free to the farmers, and the increasing interest in the work is manifested by the large number of additional inquiries that are coming in all the time for this information.

to numerous matters that have arisen recently in the House? The ministers in charge of the Estimates are always unable to inform us in regard to the general policy of the Government. The Government seems to be largely a Government of individuals, each with his own particular department in mind and unable to say just how far that department may go. This matter of cold storage is one of the most serious questions that confront the Canadian people to-day, and the Government should have a policy with regard to it. The press would lead us to believe that the people controlling the packing and cold storage plants have been making exorbitant profits. Ministers of the Government have defended the character and business ability of some of the gentlemen who have made these exorbitant profits. Conditions in Canada to-day are not satisfactory to the labouring people; they have the impression that the cold storage plants are getting too much out of the producers and the consumers. Probably twenty-five to thirty-three and a third per cent of Canada's produce is wasted for the want of proper storage facilities. The erection of a plant at Montreal wdll not relieve the situation in all other parts of the country. The erection of cold storage plants in the United States or in European countries seems to be a simple matter. Having regard to our long shipping distances and to the general conditions in this country, it would be good business for the Government to find out what it would cost to build plants so that they may be able to give that information to the towns and cities of Canada. A cold storage plant is just as important as the hen-coop or pig-sty. If it is necessary to take the duty off certain articles to promote a policy of this kind the Government can do it, just as they took the duty off farm tractors. The Government should reduce the high cost of living by providing better cold storage facilities and by making the profiteers dispose of their food products before they are allowed to rot. The minister says he has no power to do these things. Why, with the War-time Elections Act and all the other various Acts which have vested power in the Government they are able to do anything. All it requires is courage, and if my hon. friend would show some courage in the direction of satisfying the common people, the poor people, the producers, rather than the profiteers, he would be in very much better grace in Canada than he is to-day. I hope that this matter will receive the serious consideration of the Minister and that he will
look into the storage problem as one of the most serious problems that Canada faces.

In fact, he impressed me quite strongly by the earnestness of his appeal. Now he suggests that we embark on a policy that would involve the expenditure of millions. If the hon. gentleman wishes my opinion as to the policy that should be adopted-in fact, so far as announcement has been made or anything has been done it is the policy that has been adopted-it is the duty of the federal administration to provide the necessary facilities for the transportation of these products and for the care of them at ocean ports and, generally, to assist in the trade and commerce of the country. If the hon. gentleman has in mind the erection of cold storage plants in every city, town, and village in Canada, the proposition would be a very large one and might better be taken up by municipal enterprise. We have already decided on the policy of giving assistance by way of bonus to municipal cold storage plants. Any town in my hon. friend's constituency, any town or city in Canada, can say to the Government: We propose to erect a municipal cold storage plant and to make it available for the public-for merchants, farmers and all who want to use it; and the Government will upon certain conditions give assistance to the extent of thirty per cent of the cost of erecting such a plant. It would be well to test this policy out for a few years and see what results come from it, rather than to embark on an expenditure that might run into millions.

The farming community of Canada is at the present time in a favourable position as regards the minister who now presides over the Department of Agriculture. We have a fine, practical Minister of Agriculture, and I think it would be hard to get any one to equal him. Further than that, he has a deputy who is well known throughout this Dominion -and who has endeared himself to the farming community by his practical knowledge of agriculture. I refer to Professor Grisdale, a man whom I am pleased to say I have 'known for many years. He knows all the ins and outs of the farmers' requirements as well as, if not better than, any other man in Canada or possibly in any other country. Canada has been very fortunate in her choice of officials in regard to agriculture, and we need such officials now more than at any other time in our history. During the last few years, farmers have had difficulties like all other people, but I think we have suffered more than people of any other calling. It seems probable, moreover, that we are going to suffer some hardships this year on account of the backwardness of the season and of having so much rain that we can hardly get our crops in. But it is the duty of every one, no matter what his calling may be, to co-operate with the rest of the community and use his best efforts to make our soil produce as much as possible. Nothing but agricultural production will enable us to get rid of the tremendous burden of public debt which has accumulated. Agriculture is the

backbone of this country and as one who has been a farmer all his life I have no hesitation in saying that if this country were farmed as it should be, the land at present under cultivation would produce over a hundred per cent more than it does now. If we also take into account the many millions of acres the plough has not yet touched what will be the result? Not long ago, I was out West and every four or five miles there was an elevator. Not one of these elevators was built for fun; they were built to hold grain, and when they are full the returns to this country will, I am sure, surprise every one. A year or two of good crops in this Canada of ours would nearly wipe out the national debt. The money may not go as revenue direct to the Government, but it will go to individuals. We shall have the money, and when we have the money, the country will be the richer by that amount. I am glad that we have live men at the head of the Department of Agriculture, because we require live men and men who have an interest in the work and welfare of the country and I have no doubt that those men will use their efforts to the best advantage of Canada.

REID:,,SUPPLY.,,,"I wish to congratulate the minister on the very popular appointment which he has made to the position of Deputy Minister of Agriculture. Now that the minister and his deputy are both farmers we may expect great results from the administration of this department. Heretofore it would seem to have been essential that we should have a lawyer as deputy minister. Personally, I fail to see any connection between the law and the agricultural industry. 'I am, therefore, glad that the Government has got away from any such policy, and that in consequence we are likely to see most beneficial results as far as the development of agriculture is concerned. For one thing I would like to see the Government establish more experimental farms. To my mind there could not be a better investment than to add to their number. Let me give a specific instance of the value of these farms. It will be recalled that the late Dr. Saunders, who in his life time was Director of Experimental Farms, after a very prolonged and tedious series of experiments produced a distinct [DOT]type of wheat called Marquis Wheat. That particular variety has been of the utmost benefit to Canada, and I venture to assert has brought millions of dollars to this country. In Western Canada we are practically getting away altogether from the growing of the old Red Fife Wheat; and I understand that when the farmers of Ontario brought samples of that wheat from the West for seed purposes and tried them, they found that they could grow spring wheat through the agency of the Marquis. At present we have in Saskatchewan Mr. Seager Wheeler, who is doubtless known by reputation to many of the members of this House. Mr. Wheeler is a veritable wizard in producing and propagating different varieties of grain, and, as is well known, is the winner of the world's championship in wheat. At the present time he is experimenting with two other distinct varieties of wheat, the Kitchener and the Red Bobs. I think the Government should do something to encourage Mr. Wheeler in carrying on his work. For a long time he has spent almost all his time in experimenting along these lines, and now, I understand, his health ds breaking down. Mr. Wheeler's work has been of very great value, not only to the growers but to the consumers of wheat in this country. I mention these facts so 
that the minister may give his careful consideration to the matter:
Another thing I would like to draw attention to is the live stock situation. If a careful survey were taken to-day of our live stock resources, principally cattle, I believe it would be found that the situation in Canada to-day is not as good as it was, say, ten years ago. I believe that is because pure-bred sires are not being imported into Canada from the Old Country where they breed the best stock in the world. I am informed that the Argentine buyers, when they go to the United Kingdom, purchase not only pure-bred sires but female stock; they buy the very best that can be found on the market. As regards Canada I do not wish to say a word against our importers of pure-bred live stock, but with them it seems to be a matter of dollars and cents and very naturally they figure on how many dollars they can make out of a transaction. I think if our Government were to import some of the best of the different types of pure-bred cattle- pure-bred sires at least and a few of the -females-and then possibly let them out on some terms, or sell them to the stock raisers of the Dominion, so that we would have a continuous stream of the best pure-bred animals coming into Canada, it would be a splendid thing for our live stock industry.
Mr. .T. R. WILSON: The hon. gentleman who has just spoken has mentioned a matter which I am very much interested in, and which I had intended bringing to the attention of the minister, and that is the good work which Mr. Seagar Wheeler, of Saskatchewan, has been carrying on in the development of different varieties of wheat. While he was not the discoverer of Marquis wheat, Mr. Wheeler, by a process of selection, I believe, greatly improved upon the original discovery. For the information of the Committee I would like to read certain information as evidence of what Mr. Wheeler has done. As a result of his own effort, and without any assistance whatever, he is advertising Canada as a wheat producing country more than any other man that I know of. He has done this entirely at his own expense, and mainly through exhibiting the results of his experiments at exhibitions and wheat seed fairs, in the United States. Let me enumerate some of the prizes he has won in competition with the Western States as well as with various competitors from Canada.

1911.__New York Land Show. Won world's
prize, first and sweepstakes, $1,000 in gold, offered for the best hard red spring wheat grown on the continent. Won this prize with Marquis wheat, then almost unknown.
1914.	_1Von sweepstakes at International Farm Congress, Wichita, Kansas, winning again with Marquis wheat.
1915.	-Won sweepstakes with Marquis wheat at International Farm Congress at Denver, Colorado. Also first prize at International Irrigation Congress, Bassano, Alberta. Won highest honours for sheaf of Kitchener wheat at Denver.
1916.	-Won sweepstakes for fourth time, this year at International Farm Congress at El Paso, Texas, with Kitchener wheat, discovered by Mr. Wheeler.
1917.	-Mr. Wheeler wias hailed out in 1916', but exhibited a sheaf of Red Bobs Wheat, which he discovered, at International Farm Congress, Peoria, Illinois, and carried off sweepstakes.
1918.	-Won sweepstakes for fifth time for best bushel of hard spring wheat, winning this time against very strong competition at the International Soil Products Exposition, Kansas City. Won with Marquis wheat again. Also won first for sheaf of hard red wheat.
But Mr. Wheeler did not confine his efforts to wheat. Here are some of the prizes he won for oats:
1915.-Victory Oats. Won sweepstakes with a sheaf exhibit at International Farm Congress, Denver, Colorado.
1917,	-Won second prize in sheaf exhibit at International Farm Congress.
1918,	-Won first prize for sheaf exhibit at International Soil Products Exposition at Kansas City, Kansas.
He has taken up also the improvement of
barley. The following are some of the prizes that he has won in this connection:
19,14.-won third prize at International Irrigation Congress, Calgary, Alta.
1915.	-Won first prize for sheaf exhibit, International Farm Congress, Denver, Colorado.
1916.	-Won first and sweepstakes at International Farm Congress, El Paso, Texas.
1917.	-First prize for sheaf exhibit, International Farm Congress, Peoria, 111.
1918.	-Won first prize, International Soil Products Exposition, Kansas City, Kansas.
This man should have some recognition from the Department of Agriculture.

Secretary of 'State (Mr. Burrell) was Minister of Agriculture, we used to discuss the advisability of establishing not altogether demonstration farms but small farms for the development of agriculture. The idea was that some of the $10,000,000 set apart for the development of the industry could be utilized in 'buying small farms in the neighbourhood of industrial centres, say, for instance, near the steel works in the county from which I come, where there are thousands of farmers' sons, and men from Ireland, England and Scotland who make marvellous developments of little bits of land about their houses. I-t was thought that if the Government could establish thirty or forty or even twenty small farms of between twenty-five and forty acres each, with house and barn, and give a small start in the way of developing these farms, and then sell them, men would be very anxious and willing to go in for the scheme. The idea has been developed in the West by the Canadian Pacific Railway. I understand they have built houses on certain sections of land; and they sell not only the bare land but the houses and barns and some equipment. In that way they have given a great boom to agriculture in that part of the country. We have in Nova Scotia millions of acres that are unoccupied, and it is not unusual to find a man owning four or five hundred acres and living on it with his wife, being able to scratch a bare living out of perhaps five per cent of the land. That land to which I refer could be used to great advantage if people could be found to take an interest in agriculture, and I am sure the Government would lose no money if they undertook this project. All they need is courage and enterprise, and they would find these little farms would be successful and would give a fresh impetus to agriculture. It was thought in the early days that the thing would be practicable, and there was some co-operation between the honourable gentleman (Mr. Burrell) and the Minister of Agriculture for Nova Scotia. Some start was made in the buying of old farms but the matter was not looked after properly and nothing of importance has really been done. What is absolutely e* sential for the development of the country is that it shall be a place in which the ordinary man can live in comfort, and the only way in which that can be achieved is to encourage the farmer to produce and enable him to sell at reasonable prices. The only advantage to the farmer is the profit he makes, and if he can make a large\nprofit it is better for the country. He may make a fair profit on a small quantity, but if he can make a proportionate profit on large quantities of produce there is a beneficial result all round. It is absolutely necessary for the Department of Agriculture to make a departure from the rut in which we have been moving for the last twenty-five years, and to show what can be done along these lines. I have no particular line to indicate to the minister, but I have suggested what might be done in the neighbourhood of large centres. I have spoken of Cape Breton because I know men there who are ready to take hold of these little farms if they are put within their reach. They have not the means themselves to buy lands and put up houses, but if they were helped up to that stage they would jump at the proposition. The market is there and they could sell their produce, and there are young men from the Old Country who are enterprising enough to do very well if they were given a start. Another thing I might point out is the desirability of encouraging the extension of tram cars that are in touch with agricultural land so as to encourage the farmer. Companies might be encouraged to push their lines into the country. These things cost money, but the minister in charge of the department must have courage to depart from the old line and not hesitate to spend money abundantly so long as good results can be obtained. We want to make 'Canada produce something proportionate to its capacity for production.\nMr. iLEiMIEUX: In connection with the distribution of literature, I have noticed that literature is printed in both languages and when any one applies to the department he can get either French or English copies. I want to inform the minister-and this can be confirmed by the deputy minister-that the best agent of the department in my province is the cure, who is generally the honorary president and sometimes the secretary of what we call the Circles Agricoles. There is one in every county, and sometimes one in every parish, and in the pulpit on nearly every 'Sunday of the year in these rural districts the cure will spend a portion of his time speaking to the farmers on agricultural matters.\nI would like my hon. friend to send the literature which is issued by the department in French-not all, but the most essential bulletins-to the cures of the province of Quebec, so as to secure their devotion to the cause. Because the great issue of the day is the necessity of getting our"", ""people back to the land and improving living conditions in the rural districts. I have offered these remarks now because unfortunately, I shall not be able to be present this evening.\nMr. 'CRERAR:\tI can say to the hon.\ngentleman that the suggestion which he has made will be acted upon.\nAt six o'clock the House resumed and took recess.\nAfter Kecess.\nThe House resumed at eight o'clock.""]",,,,

Under present conditions my experience has been, not working in this line of work as a hobby but rather as a business, that it costs at least from $150 to $200 to produce a yearling bull. If that price or even a bare advance on that may seem rather high to the purchaser of the animal, still when that animal is taken into a herd of twenty or thirty cows, the improvement in the first year, or at least by the second year, will easily pay for the initial outlay. For the man who is unable to pay out that much money for a sire, the Government has made it easy to get one through the plan which has been described to-night. Ten men can get together and secure the services of a sire. In British Columbia this has worked with great advantage, particularly in districts along the line of the Grand Trunk Pacific and other isolated places where settlers have just gone in, where they have not got their farms cleaned up and where they are too poor to pay for a sire. Under ordinary circumstances in ten years from now these men would still be breeding scrub cattle; but by being afforded an opportunity of securing the services of a pure-bred sire under this plan, in five or ten years they have a fine lot of high-grade cattle worth far more money than the scrub cattle would be, and in addition to that ten men have been educated to the value of using pure-bred sires. When they are able to buy sires in future they will prefer to buy pure-breds instead of grades. While our live stock in Canada is worth a great deal of money and while we have made certain advances, we are still in our swad-dli g clothes as regards possible developments. It will be generally admitted that the quality of beef in this country is inferior when compared with that of Australia or of the Argentine Republic. It has, however, been proved on one or two occasions that we are quite capable of producing beef of first-class quality. I might cite the case of one or two Ontario breeders who have been able to take steers down to the great International show in Chicago and win the sweepstakes there in competition with the whole continent. On another occasion, Mr. James D. McGregor, of Brandon, Manitoba, took down a steer one year and won the sweepstakes, and the next
190}
year he took down a full brother of the first one and won the sweepstakes again, the only occasion when that was done by a single feeder or breeder. I am credibly informed that our beef, as we produce it, is very much inferior to that of the Argentine, as I have described, and that their average run of chilled beef placed on the market in the old country is equal to the average run of our Christmas beef to be found on the markets of this country. I am ialso informed that in the inspected abattoirs of Canada not more than 10 per cent of beef that is passed through is fit to export to the old country in competition with beef from the other countries I have mentioned. This shows that we have a vast field for improvement which can only be made by the use of pure-bred sires, and then by proper feeding and finishing before our animals are sent to the market. The Argentine stock raisers have never hesitated to pay high prices for bulls, in fact *they go into the markets of Great Britain and pay more than the stock raisers of any other country, and they have recently paid as high as $30,000 for a single animal. In that country you will fine herds of from 1,000 to 3,000 head very uniform throughout, whereas in this country you would find a few hundred really good animals and the rest would be very ordinary, showing that there is a great deal to be done in the improvement of beef cattle in Canada. How this should be done is a matter for deep consideration by the officials of our Department of Agriculture. One way to do it would be to begin at the bottom by inducing stock raisers to breed better animals and put them on the market in better condition. To do this there is no better plan that I know of than to offer liberal prizes at our fat stock shows and live stock exhibitions. This plan has been carried out for many years at 'Chicago, and the quality of the beef has steadily improved. In addition to this the man who has a carload of beef in better finished condition to offer for sale will receive two or three cents a pound more than the man who has his beef in an unfinished state.
Coming to dairy cattle, I cannot pass without drawing the attention of the committee to the fact that one of our Canadian breeders, Mr. I. B. Hanmer, of Norwich, Ontario, has recently bred a cow which has broken the world's record, having produced just under 52 pounds of butter in seven days. Hon. members will realize what achievement this cow has made when they take into consideration the fact that the average dairy cow of Canada would not pro-

duce more than about one pound per day, while this cow averaged between seven and eight pounds per day. We have in this country cattle that have produced over 30,-(000 pounds of milk in one year. The average dairy cow of Canada produces less than 4,000 pounds, showing what a splendid field for improvement there is, and this can be accomplished only by the use of pure-bred sires and also by feeding in a way such as I have described and by the dissemination of agricultural education.
Coming to sheep, I think this country is in a most disgraceful condition. We have less than 3,000,000 sheep in the whole of the Dominion as compared with 90,000,000 to 100,000,000 in Australia and about 40,000,000 in Great Britain. Here is an excellent opportunity to develop a valuable industry, an industry that will be valuable not only to the straight stock farmer but to the grain farmer of the West in keeping down weeds. Sheep are a class of live stock that can be produced very largely on the waste material that is to be found on the farm.
The condition of our pork products is very satisfactory. A report was brought back by Mr. Arkell to the effect that Canadian bacon now stands very high on the British market. The Britishers apparently did not begin to realize how good our Canadian bacon was until they had been forced to eat the fat bacon that is produced in the United States, and it behooves the Department of Agriculture to use the utmost care to see that this market is developed in every possible way and also that we send over only first-class material so that we can retain the market and build up a splendid outlet for Canadian live stock products in the future.
I think that the stimulation of the use of pure bred sires all over the country is most important. Just as long as we use scrub sires and do not care whether we improve our -cattle or not, we shall be moving around in a circle and shall not get anywhere; but if an intelligent system is followed, and pushed to the fullest extent, I am sure we shall get excellent results. I commend the department for the action they are taking. I know they have a number of live officials who are working along these lines and I am sure a great deal can be accomplished by following the course I have outlined.
