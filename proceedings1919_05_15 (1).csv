iMr. GUTHRIE: It has been pointed out since this section was adopted that there is no provision in it with regard to what estate a trustee can convey. Of course, it is assumed that he can convey all the estate of the debtor. It has been suggested that a declaration to that effect be incorporated in the Bill. It has also been drawn to my attention that there is a difficulty in the province of Quebec in regard to trustees' deeds; they do not operate in that province quite in the same way as they do in other provinces. It
4 p.m. seems that liens, mortgages, hypothecs and the like are not removed by trustee's deed and a clear title cannot be conveyed. Several prominent members of the Bar of the province of Quebec have directed my attention to this fact and have suggested an amendment so that we might give to a trustee's deed in that province the same effect as is now given to a sheriff's deed. Personally I see no objection to inserting a clause to that effect, if it is the desire of the Committee. I move that the following be added as subsection (3):
All sales of real estate made by the trustee shall vest in the purchaser all the legal and equitable estate of the debtor therein.
That will be the general clause. Then I move that the following be added as subclause (a) of subsection (2):
(a) In the province of Quebec a sale of real estate made by the trustee shall have the same effect as to mortgages, hypothecs or privileges then existing thereon as if the same had been made by a sheriff in the said province under a writ of execution issued in the ordinary course, and the title conveyed by such sale in the said province shall have equal validity with a title created by sheriff's sale and the conveyance of the trustee shall have the same effect as a sheriff's deed in the said province.

Has he had any correspondence with the consumers and farmers who have to purchase this fertilizer or with any farmer's association?

(Mr. A. K. MACLEAN: I cannot say that there has been any consultation with the consumer. I would like to impress upon my hon. friend that the tax is merely upon the brand. It is not $8, $16, or $24 per ton. The manufacturer may sell 100,000 tons of a certain brand but he will only be charged $24. It will not afford any substantial proportion of the. cost to the department of the administration of the Act. I do not think it is a burdensome tax or that it will meet with any opposition from the consumer.
Mr. MeCOIG: This seems to be a very simple matter to take up the time of the House with. As other matters come before the House, as commissions and officers are appointed, the department itself provides for defraying the expense, but when, it comes to such an important question as fertilizer is to the producers of this country and also to the consumers, it does seem ridiculous that a little cent or two cent tax has to be collected to defray the expenses of the officer who administers the Act. I do not see why the department does not assume the responsibility itself and pay the expenses of the administration of the Act instead of having some officer pulling a cent or two cent tax or a hundred pounds out of the purchaser, of the fertilizer and administering the Act at his expense. In the department there are men who are being paid by the Government to look after matters of this kind without penalizing the consumer by collecting a cent on every hundred pounds or twenty cents on every ton. They will have to keep a lot of bookkeepers to keep track of the administration of this Act and the distribution of the stamps. It is going to involve a lot of unnecessary expense.

I have given a good deal of thought to it, having regard to the discussion which took place on the question of absconding debtors. It will be remembered that at the last meeting of the Committee considerable discussion took place as to what provision we should insert. I_find that the dictionary meaning of the term "" abscond "" is:
To remove one's self from the jurisdiction of the court; to place one's self in hiding.
In my judgment, and it has been confirmed by the conferences I have had with some very prominent lawyers both from

Ontario and Quebec, I think the section would be improved if we inserted the words "" from Canada "" after the word "" abscond "". The section would then read: "" Abscond from Canada."" It must be remembered that the Act has Dominion wide application. The mere fact that a debtor goes from one province to another would hardly in my judgment constitute absconding; he is still within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, and he is not in hiding.
Therefore I move:
To amend! section 55 by adding the words ""from Canada"" after the word ""abscond"" in the twelfth line of the said section at p. 44 of the Bill.
It will then read:
If, after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition against him, it appears to the court that there is probable reason for believing that he has absconded, or Us about to abscond from Canada, with a view of avoiding payment of the debt in respect of which the bankruptcy petition was filed, or of avoiding appearance to any such petition or of avoiding examination in respect of his affairs or of otherwise avoiding, delaying or embarrassing proceedings in bankruptcy against him.

We have not at the present time a uniform law in all the provinces in regard to this matter. In the province of Ontario in case of assignment we allow the landlord one year of past due rent as a preference, and also three months future rent. I understand that in the province of Quebec the landlord can legally claim one year's future rent, and I think varying sums are permitted in the other provinces. The Committee which had this Bill in charge last year paid a great deal of attention to this section. It was urged that if we interfered with landlords' rights landlords would insist on stiffer terms when leases were negotiated, and that the rent probably would become payable in advance. However, a body representing almost thirty thousand retail merchants of this country, who ara the great tenant class among the merchants, appeared before the Committee and specifically approved the enactment. So far as they are concerned they are not afraid of the terms which may be imposed upon them by landlords in the future. This section provides that when bankruptcy proceedings take place the landlord's right

to a preference over other creditors shall be for rent for the last three months of the term, and it will be a first charge upon the estate. A landlord can always protect himself; he does not need to let his rent get three months in arrear. He has special privileges which other creditors do not possess; he can distrain the goods of his tenant and can realize at almost any moment. He is negligent if he allows his rent to become more than three months in arrear; and for the protection of the general creditors the Committee thought that three months was a fair and reasonable amount of rent to allow as a preference over the claims of other creditors. It was with that view that this section was drawn as it now appears. Of course, he is not deprived from claiming for all the rent due, but for anything beyond the three months he can only claim as an ordinary creditor. The Committee thought that was pretty fair treatment for the landlord, and it would be a good thing to make it uniform throughout Canada.
We must bear in mind that landlords have always been creatures whom our legislation and British legislation have favoured from time immemorial. Our present law of landlord and tenant is a relic of the feudal system and was made when landlords sat in Parliament, but tenants did not. Up to fifty or sixty years ago the law was so onesided in favour of the landlord that it was practically a disgrace. Gradually the hardships have been ameliorated by legislation; but to-day in Ontario a landlord is permitted too large a claim, in my humble judgment, when he is allowed one year of arrears and three months advance rent in the case'of assignment. I do not know what view the Committee will take of the clause, but in my judgment it is a very fair one.

If she has an estate separate from it-hat of her husband why should she not receive the same consideration as lin the case of any other separate estate? For instance take the case of a married woman who has inherited property from her parents, which is entirely separate from the estate of her husband, and has advanced money to him to carry on his business.
I fail to see the wisdom or the fairness of the change. I think the wife is just as legally entitled as any outsider to rank as a creditor of that estate. Her money and her property are her own in that case, and she makes the loan as a purely business transaction so far as she and her husband are concerned. It seems to me, not looking at it from the legal aspect, but from the ordinary business aspect, that the woman should have the protection of the court for her estate as against her husband, and that he on his side should have similar protection against his wife.

kinds of manipulation and of wrong-doing in regard to financial matters, and particularly as they pertain to creditors, than the relationship that exists between husband and wife. I call my hon. friend's attention in the first place to the fact that this section applies only to the future. So that husbands and wives will know after this Bill becomes law that if they loan money one to the other for business or other purposes they are taking chances under this section, and their claims may be postponed to those of otljier creditors. The reason for the section is that in the majority of cases of assignment a husband or a wife prefers a large claim against the estate. It may be that the claim is perfectly valid in most cases, but there are many cases in which the claim: is decidedly invalid and should not be allowed to prevail as against the creditors. Such fictitious claims are so easily made and so hard to defeat that you must in some way protect ordinary creditors against them. To do so we must enact something such as we have attempted by section 48. That section has been largely used in England, and it will be used in this country, too, in future, I am sure. Case after case comes up when not only does the husband or the wife prefer a claim as a creditor for money loaned, but in addition a claim for wages. Those claims may be proper enough, but in future, if this Bill becomes law husbands and wives must take notice that such claims will only be paid after the claims of other creditors. If with that notice staring them in the face they allow their claims for wages to accumulate they will have to take the consequences. It is in order to defeat the large number of fictitious claims which are presented in cases of bankruptcy, that it has been found necessary, I think, in every civilized country which has a bankruptcy law to include a clause of this kind.

On motion of Mr. Archambault the Committee reverted to the consideration of section 8.
On section^-application of part 1.",,,,
531649,ca.proc.d.1919-05-15.3.3.98,1919-05-15,3012525e-b75c-4c87-89d8-4c9c7330e136,ca.m.3330,Mr. ARCHAMBAULT:,,SUPPLY BILL.,BANKRUPTCY ACT.,,"I desire to move .an amendment to this clause. I object to the application of Part I of the Bill to non-traders. This is the first time that there has been brought into the House of Commons of Canada a Bankruptcy Act which includes non-traders in its application. The Bankruptcy Act of 1875, which was repealed in 1879, and the Bill introduced in 1897 by Mr. Fortin, who is now judge of the Superior Court, did not apply to non-traders. I have gone carefully over legislation on bankruptcy of different countries, and I believe the only countries in which Bankruptcy Acts apply to nontraders are Great Britain and the United States. In Prance, Belgium and other countries, the Acts do not apply to nontraders. My principal objection to the extension of the law to non-traders is this: The enforcement of a bankruptcy law is a serious matter; it means a searching investigation into the affairs of a man by his creditors. It is encroaching on private rights. It allows the creditors to find out private secrets of all kinds and, in fact, it is a grave violation of property rights. The debtor ceases to have charge of his business and his creditors take his place and as Thallier says in his study on bankruptcy, only the most important reasons can justify such an action. The necessi-
[Mr. Jacobs.)
ties of trade afford Parliament an opportunity of adopting such measures, although this is clearly odious to private rights. Credit requires such legislation, such violation of the liberty of the proprietor, and business cannot dispense with it. In what position would a trader be if he could not obtain credit from his banker or other creditors? That is the reason for a bankruptcy law. The law should give the banker or other creditors the assurance that if the debtor should fail, a trustee will be named who will take charge of his assets for the benefit of all creditors, present or absent. Otherwise, without this law there would be no protection for the creditors in contingencies against which no one can be safeguarded. In business relations many creditors now reside far away from their debtors, while other debtors are more easily accessible. If the insolvency law were abolished, creditors living near the debtor and being consequently more in touch with him than those who are distant, would seize his assets first, to the prejudice of those living far away; and without insolvency legislation there would be this further effect, that only cash sales would be made. There would be no more credit, and in consequence practically no trade. This consideration, however, does not, I submit,
. apply to non-traders. The judge, the doctor, the lawyer, or the professional man lives on his income or his salary, and has no justification in living beyond his means. His profession should preclude the necessity of speculations inherent to trade, and if he obtains credit it is not on the guarantee of any assets but merely on his personal promise to pay, and his creditors will wait until he receives his income. Unlike the case of the trader, to whom credit is a business necessity, society is not interested whether the man who receives a salary gets credit or not. Admitting that the non-trader contracts debts, it is highly improbable that his creditors will either be so numerous or most of them so far distant that some living in proximity to the debtor will reap all the benefits to the prejudice of the others. Besides that, there is a constitutional viewpoint to consider. I will grant for a moment that the law of bankruptcy in regard to the trader, even if it touches civil rights and property, as it necessarily does, is within the province of the federal power. But I contend that subsection 21 of section 91 of The British North America Act evidently conferred such power, because it pertained to the trade and commerce legislation, which is exclusively within the purview of the Federal

Government. I am sure, however, that the intention of the legislators in reference to subsection 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act, which gives the province control of legislation in regard to property and civil rights, was not to extend the bankruptcy legislation to anything outside trade and commerce, and it would undoubtedly go beyond their intention if this law -were made applicable to nontraders. I therefore move, seconded by Mr. Jacobs:
That subsection 1 of clause 8 be amended by striking out all the words after the first line of said section, beiing line 21 of nage 8, and substituting the following words: "" non traders.""

point upon which there might be considerable argument. There is no doubt that in the Insolvency Bill of 1375 an attempt was made to confine the operation of that Act to traders, and one of the objections to the Act always was that it was so confined. It is contended that there is a large class of non-traders who are 'debtors and should be treated as ordinary citizens of the country, amenable to the ordinary laws, whether of bankruptcy or otherwise. Another difficulty is to give anything like an adequate definition of the word ""trader."" The definition in the Act of 1875 was certainly defective, but it covers almost two pages of typewritten matter, defining almost all classes of business enterprise we know in Canada. But still it would not suffice for a definition at the present time, because we have a great many avenues of trade and commerce today that were not in existence then. So that it would be extremely difficult to define just who were and who were not traders. In England the experience has been that the Act should apply generally to all classes. I think that about fifty years ago, in the sixties, the Act was limited to traders, but after an experience of some years, that Act was extended, and the British and the United States Acts to-day both apply to all classes of the people in regard not only to obligations created by the Act, but to the benefits which are conferred upon the honest debtor in the way of obtaining his discharge. I know, however, that in France, Belgium, and one or two other continental countries the bankruptcy Acts are still confined to traders. Having heard from as many public commercial bodies as I could upon the subject, and having heard a long discussion in the Special Committee by a great many interested classes, I concluded, and the Committee concluded, that this Bill, in order to have a fair chance of
operation, should be made general in its application. For instance, it was urged by the very large association of retail merchants which has a membership in Canada of some 30,000, that it was unfair to them to put all the imposition on their shoulders and allow them none of the benefits. As it was pointed out that one of the great debtor classes was professional people, the question was asked, why should they not be included? and the Committee took that view. My o-wn view is that if you are to give the Act a fair chance of success you must extend it beyond the trading classes. If it should prove to be burdensome or to be an undue imposition upon the people, within a year of its operation there would be a demand for its repeal. But I do not think it will be burdensome. On the contrary, I think it will be a great benefit to both the debtor and the creditor classes, and I certainly support the present generality of its terms.

It is said that the farmer is very much more subject to unforeseen accidents than any other class of people in the community. He may be solvent to-day, with bright prospects for the coming year, and when everything looks promising he may experience a disastrous accident. He could be put into bankruptcy by reason of his inability during a season to meet maturing liabilities, and he might be sold out and his farm taken from him. But in the ordinary course, if he were given another year or two, he would have big crops and be on his feet again and be re-established. He might be the victim of natural causes beyond his control, and for that reason the Act was not made to apply either to the farmer or to the small wage-earner.

The advisory hoard shall have power to prescribe what shall be deemed a sufficient medication of medicines containing alcohol in excess of two and a half per cent to make them unfit for use as beverages.
There is a considerable agitation in all the provinces in connection with the sale of patent medicines and the fact that they are too high in alcoholic content. Any patent medicines containing over two and one half per cent of alcohol must be approved by the Advisory Council before they can be sold. I wish to amend this section by inserting after the word ""registration"" on the second line the following:
Or any medicine containing more than two and a half per cent of alcohol or containing any of the drugs mentioned in or added to the schedule of the Act.
We are not amending the schedule, which contains a list of dangerous drugs which can be used only with the consent or permission of the Advisory Council. Two and a half per cent is fixed by reason of the fact that in no province is that alcoholic content in drugs or patent medicines prohibited.
I wish to amend the subsection further by striking out the words ""essential formula and composition of such medicine"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words ""quantity of alcohol or of such drug or drugs contained in such medicine."" This will put the Advisory Board in a position to determine whether the alcoholic content is in excess of two and a half per cent, and will also give information as to the drug or drugs contained in such medicine. The section as it now stands requires the disclosure of the essential formula and com-



position of the medicine. It was deemed possible that that would be unfair, because it would compel the proprietor to disclose all knowledge relating to his property.

If on investigation a patent medicine is found to be one that should not be sold it would be put on the forbidden list, or to deal with it may require an amendment of the Act. The purpose of the Bill is that all men should register any patent medicine they make. Upon what principle can we say that the ordinary druggist should pay less than the

wholesaler or the manufacturer? If the manufacturer makes more money than the retailer, as he probably does, the revenue of the Government should get some of that money in the shape of income tax. If we are not getting enough now from that source then the income tax should be raised.

Mr. JOHN A. STEWART: The remarks of the hon. gentleman (Mr. Steele) are very likely to create a misapprehension in the minds of the members of the Committee. When he states, as he has done, the volume of the goods manufactured the inference might be drawn that that volume of business comes under the provisions of the license which has to be taken out under the Bill. But under the provision of the Proprietary and Patent Medicines Act the manufacturer of a patent or proprietary medicine has two courses open to him. He may put upon the label of his goods the formula of the contents. If he does not do that he must register it as a proprietary or patent medicine. The only preparations which will be subject to this license, as I understand it, are those which are registered. Now a very small proportion of the business referred to by the hon. member (Mr. Steele) represents a registered business. In addition to those patent or proprietary medicines which do not contain the formula upon the label and which come under the license, there is a /very large volume of preparations which are manufactured for dispensing-preparations which are manufactured for the druggist and dispensed upon the prescription of physicians. All that business does not come under the necessity for a license, as I understand the Bill. It would therefore be a very great mistake to imagine that anything more than a small proportion of the
[Mr. A. K. Maclean!
volume of business concerned will come under license at all. In fact I may say that some of the largest selling proprietary medicines on the market to-day are sold with the formula on the label and are not registered.

most important clauses of this Bill. With regard to the new section 6, it will strike every member of the Committee that if a drug is "" dangerous for infants under one year old "" it is dangerous also for children a year and a half old. The most important question in connection with the manufacture and sale of patent medicines is that which relates to the use of soothing or calmative syrups for children. The use of these preparations in 'Canada has assumed such formidable proportions that we cannot ignore the subject. What they contain is well known to the medical profession, to pharmacists generally and to the better-educated class of the population. They contain opium and the derivatives of opium)-

that is, morphine, codeine, heroine, the-baine and other narcotics. If the good Canadian mothers were cognizant of the ravages caused among their dear ones by the use of these preparations, they would immediately and entirely abstain from administering them to their children. They are induced 'to use them by the alluring descriptions on the labels. It may be argued that you should not interfere with a well-established trade in Canada. But what is the importance, I ask, of the advantages reaped by manufacturers of these patent medicines as compared with the necessity of preserving 'the health of those beings who to-morrow will constitute the very -essence of the Canadian population? It may be known to some-it is not to me- that heartless mothers, knowing what they do, administer calmative syrups for the purpose of soothing their children.
But it is well known to every one that, for instance, in the absence of the mother, an unscrupulous servant may administer those syrups in large quantities, and the mental and physical consequences cannot be measured. Therefore, I intend to move an amendment to section G, reserving for myself the right to express my opinion further on clause 7. I am not going to adhere to the wording of this amendment; if it be found that an amendment suggested toy some member of the committee or by the minister may be more effective, easier of administration or of carrying out, I am ready to accept such suggestion. I move to amend clause 1 of the present Bill by striking out the proposed section 6 and replacing it by the following:
6. The manufacture, importation or Bale ot all proprietary or patent medicines containing opium or its derivatives or any derivatives of coal tar intended for administration to children under fifteen years, are prohibited.

I am quite sure, after having discussed this matter with some of the medical authorities, that many of the subjects fit for our asylums or even for our jails, were the early victims of these soothing syrups, because all their troubles in life can be traced to the use of opium and narcotics generally. The other day, a very distinguished doctor from Montreal told me that he could point out on the street young men of twenty or twenty-five years of age whose demeanour showed the use of narcotics when they were infants. It is admitted to-day that it is a great misfortune that we should allow any of this poison to be served by fathers or mothers to their children. Many associations of

ladies, doctors, members of all sects and denominations, have taken a special interest in what is called baby welfare. The other day I received from the Baby Welfare Committee of Montreal a letter which has doubtless been sent to the minister, This letter informs me that the following resolution was adopted unanimously at a meeting held at Montreal a few days ago:
Whereas, there is a Bill to amend the Proprietary or Patent medicine Act now before the House of Commons, sponsored by Hon. A. K. Maclean, which, in the experience of the medical adviser and ohild welfare specialists connected with the various units of the Baby Welfare Committee of Montreal, does not safeguard the moral or physical entity of the young child, inasmuch as under section 6, of the proposed Act, opium-containing medication is readily procurable for any infant or child: and, inasmuch, as the Act applies solely to opium in section 6, without reference to its more dangerous habit forming derivatives, as morphine, heroin, etc., being fully considered.
Therefore, be it resolved that this committee go strongly on record as disapproving of section 6 and 7, as at present constituted, and that we urge the manufacture and sale of opium, or its derivatives, in medication be absolutely forbidden in Canada, as not being conducive to the moral or physical betterment of our younger citizenship. In default of this recommendation being adopted, that a conspicuous skull and crossbones emblem, with the word ""Poison"" distinctly printed across the container, be employed as a deterring influence upon the promiscuous distribution of this unnecessary class of narcotic medication, destined for popular sale and consumption among infants and children in Canada.
I would not only put this sinister emblem of a skull and cross-bones on the bottle containing this poisonous substance for the children, but bar the substance completely from the homes of Canada. It is a crime to allow those soothing syrups, made up of opium or other narcotics, to be exposed for sale in our drug stores or be sold by quack doctors travelling throughout the country. We have already too many subjects in our asylums, too many juvenile delinquents in our jails who have acquired their bad habits by the use early in life of those so-called medicaments. I hope the Committee will accept the wise amendment and that we shall not hear any more of those soothing syrups which are nothing less than poison.

I am sorry only that it does not go further. What is not good for a child of fourteen years of age is not good for a child of sixteen years of age. Had this amendment not been moved, or should it be rejected by the Committee, I would suggest another amendment, that a sub-clause be inserted in
clause 7 to the effect that no proprietary or patent medicine should be manufactured, imported, exposed or offered for sale in Canada if it contains opium or any of its derivatives. I would exclude all patent medicines containing opium from sale or importation, whether administered to children under fifteen years of age or to adults over fifteen years of age. They should certainly he prohibited for children. The facts presented to the Committee by the hon. members for Beauce (Mr. Beland) and Maisonneuve (Mr. Lemieux) to-ndght clearly indicate the views of the people who are engaged in baby welfare work, the people who, perhaps, above all others, are qualified to speak of the results of the administration of medicines containing opium to our little children. No doubt opium serves a good purpose sometimes, but too often, in fact in the great majority of cases, it is used to sooth a child suffering from some ailment which should be corrected if the child is going to enjoy good health. It covers up the real ailment affecting the child, keeps the child quiet, and if this goes on long enough, the child will no doubt be found in a moribund condition from the disease from which it is suffering, assisted possibly by the doses of opium. There is another effect which it has on the child, and which, I think, is admitted by all who have given the matter study, namely, that upon the brain. The brain of a child undergoes its greatest development in the first six months of life.
The brain of an adult weighs on an average from 1,400 to 1,500 grammes, and that of a baby six months old on an average about 1,000 grammes. Yet, during these six months of infant life, there are thousands of babies being fed daily on these remedies, call them what you choose, whose chief ingredients are opium or its derivatives, and the development of the brain of a child so fed is interfered with to the extent to which opium is administered to it. The chances of children fed that way for growing up healthy both physically and intellectually are greatly reduced. We not only think that opium should not be sold indiscriminately for administration to children, but that, in Ontario at least, it should not he sold indiscriminately for the use of even adults, who experience considerable difficulty in purchasing opium in any drug store in Ontario. The purchaser of opium has to sign the poison book and observe all the precautions with which the law surrounds its sale. Every person realizes that it is not in the interest of even adults that * they should be permitted to buy opium

freely and use it as they please. That being so, why should they be allowed to purchase it indiscriminately and with the greatest freedom in the form of patent medicines? I think we should exclude it entirely in patent medicines, and when people want opium they should procure it under proper supervision, duly observing the precautions and restrictions which the law imposes. It will be observed that the first sub-clause prohibits the importation and sale of any medicine containing cocaine or any of its salts or preparation. Now, we all know that cocaine so used is not likely to be nearly so injurious as opium, and if we_ prohibit cocaine the arguments in favour of the prohibition of opium are very much strengthened. For these reasons I certainly would vote for the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Beauce. If, however, it is not considered satisfactory to the Committee, I would move the amendment which I have suggested, that the entire importation, manufacture and sale of any patent medicines containing opium or its derivatives be prohibited. I believe that now is the time for us to take this step. The very fact that liquor is being restricted in its sale is an argument for us at this early date to protect the people against the indiscriminate use of opium and more injurious drugs which too often will be substituted for the liquor that is prohibited.

raised by the hon. member for Temiscouata is that the present Bill which was introduced and passed in the Senate before being submitted to the House of Commons contains clauses involving public taxation in the form of license fees and therefore could not originate in the Senate and must be rejected by the House of Commons'. It is true that section 53 of the British North America Act expressly provides:
Bills for appropriating any part of the public revenue, or for imposing any tax or impost [DOT] shall originate in the House of Commons.

But there are many precedents where Bills of this nature have been passed in the Senate and the money clauses embodied in -the Bills have been later submitted to a Committee of the Whole House. Bourinot at page 493 says:
It is frequently found convenient to introduce bills involving public expenditure in the Senate, and in such a case the money clauses are embodied in the bill as presented, in order
to make it more intelligible	These clauses
are always considered in a previous Committee by the Commons, and regularly referred to the Committee of the Whole on the bill.
The same practice applies to Bills imposing any tax or impost and should be followed in all cases when the House of Commons insists upon its rights and privileges. These rights and privileges are laid down in rule 78, but rule 87 provides that in order to expedite the business of Parliament, the House will not always insist on -the privilege of laying aside a Bill sent from the Senate because it imposes a tax, an impost or a penalty. The House of Commons undoubtedly had the right and privilege of laying aside -this Bill until it had been preceded by a resolution which would have been considered by a Committee of the Whole House, but the proper -time for -the exercise of this privilege was when the order was called for the second reading of this Bill. It was read a second time without objection and is now under -consideration in Committee. A committee has no power to refuse the consideration of a Bill which has been submitted to it by the -House, and I must therefore declare that the point of order is not now well taken.

It does not appear to me that in this age one legitimate excuse can be offered for putting up in a patent medicine any form of opium to be dispensed by the laity to children. The proposal seems to be absolutely contrary to the rapidly growing practice in the medical profession which is to eliminate it as far as possible, in treating diseases not only of infants but of adults. We in the medical profession know that from time to time an emergency call comes from some home where an infant has, through ignorance or other cause, taken an overdose of opium, laudanum, paregoric, or some form of the derivatives of opium; and many of us have seen lives pass out of this world owing to the fact that medicines of that nature were easily procurable and were more or less daily used in the home as household remedies. Now the object of this Bill is to protect the public; it could have none other. It does look to me, I must say, as though the interests had not been very far away when this Bill was drawn-not only as regards the present hut with respect to other' succeeding clauses. This measure has all the earmarks of a Bill which'had, I was going to say, been commercialized, or the earmarks of a commercial transaction. We must not get away from the fact that our object is to pass a Bill that will protect the public. I do not think any professional man or any layman can adduce a single argument to-day that will justify putting any derivative of opium into the hands of the public to be administered to children without knowing its nature, because that is what this Bill means. If you are going to give the public any form of medicine containing any of the derivatives of opium for goodness sake let it be indicated on the bottle so that the purchaser can read it and know they are administering some form of a drug which is very dangerous and very injurious. Opium, of course, has its uses, but I think I am within the mark when I say that practically the only great use it has is to alleviate pain; all other uses are detrimental to health and are absolutely dangerous to children.

We have a contract with the older company, the Ottawa Electric Company, made, I think, in 1916, and in that contract are set forth the amounts which we pay.

For instance, we take care of the approaches to the bridge across the Ottawa river, just below the falls. It is not a very great amount of money, but there is some expended every year in keeping that up. I cannot justify it, I cannot give any reason for it; I can only say: It is there. The Plaza in front of the Chateau Laurier comes under that category, the reason being that a great many years ago the Government maintained the bridges over the canal, known as the Duf-ferin and Sapper bridges, and those having been converted into the Plaza, we still take care of the maintenance.

Since this House has assembled I have been asked a number of times to make changes in the rooms in this building. Such changes are not very great and I give them only as an illustration. It takes men and material to make those changes, and, so far as I know, they have all been granted. With the great congestion of civil servants in the last three or four years-and it has oeen great-a staff gets so big that it cannot occupy its premises and other premises must be provided for it ana it has to be moved. There always must be changes. This is like a man moving into a new house-no man ever moved into a house in his life but his wife wanted some papering done or something else; she wanted a change of some kind. That is the way witu civil servants-they want change and one has to have a staff to provide for such changes, and we have a staff of 157 men. I must, say I think those men are pretty busy most of the time. Sometimes I wonder if it would not be possible to get a better system than we have in regard to the changing of staffs; but with the congestion that we have had to contend with in the last year and a half we have done the best we could, and I do not see the possibility of any improvement until the Dominion of Canada owns its own buildings. I do not believe one-half of our staff is housed in our own buildings to-day, and even when the new Hunter building is completed, as I hope it -will be in July or August next, still nearly one-half of the staff will be housed in rented buildings. And every time we make a change in the occupation of those buildings or any portion of them it costs money to move the staffs, and something must always be done, such as the buying of new furniture. Civil servants are just like other human beings; they want things and they usually get them. I can give no other explanation. I have no doubt at all -that in this Committee there are a dozen men who could take those 157 men, if they could deal with them as hired men, and put competent foremen

over them, and who would get more work out of them than the country is getting. But I cannot stand .over them myself. In the last year and a half those men have been hired and they have been fired, if necessary, entirely by the superintendent in charge of them. No man, excepting the clerk of works, has anything to say as to who shall go on that staff; he has an absolutely free hand. I have talked the matter over with him many times; I have found fault that those men are not giving as much service as^ they should give; but he assures me they are, and unless I can find time to go out and supervise them personally, I do not see how I am going to change conditions. I want to treat the Committee fairly and tell them exactly t'he situation. I think a change should be made; I think our staff is too big, but now these men want an eight-hour day. They want nearly everything except work.

That contract expires on the 1st of June. There have been a number of conferences between the city of Ottawa and a committee of the Government as to the terms of the renewal of the contract. The Mayor of Ottawa published a very exhaustive statement in January last setting forth his contention as to what the Government should pay, the amount he fixes being about $800,000 a year. We had a meeting before Parliament met and a great many since, and finally, representing the Committee, I made an offer of $150,000 a year to the Ottawa Improvement Commission for the next ten years-$100,000 a year to go to the city to cover all services performed by the city for the Government, and the Government to relinquish to the city the right of taxing civil servants upon their incomes. For a great many years there has been an arrangement by which the city of Ottawa has not taxed the incomes of civil servants by reason of amounts which the Government has been paying to the city. I have taken the ground that it is none of our business. The civil servant resident in the city is an ordinary citizen and should pay his taxes the same as any other man. In my proposal we relinquish in favour of the city the right of taxing civil servants. The city think they can raise $57,000 a year from income taxes, but my opinion is they should get $75,000 or $80,000 a year under a proper administration of the law. Taking the city's figure it would mean that instead of $150,000 going to the 'Commission there would be a sum of $307,000. The city claim that we should pay on the basis of taxation.

There would be an actual increase of $135,000 a year paid by the Government. Under the British North America Act, Government property is not taxable, and the city of Ottawa claim that because of this fact we should pay them an amount representing what the taxes ordinarily ought to be. Of course, we cannot admit that, but there is one matter with which I have a great deal of sympathy. One of the most antediluvian laws regarding water or any public utility that I have ever heard of in my life exists in Ottawa. A man pays $2, I think, on the first $1,000 valuation of his property, and after that pays a greater rate on every other $1,000. And you pay that no matter whether you use water or not, or whether you have half a dozen bathrooms or none at all; and even if it is a vacant lot you pay the same water rate. They say that a fair valuation of Government property in Ottawa would be about $20,000,000, and that therefore we should pay water rates according to this valuation. I say that we should pay water rates according to the number of thousand gallons used, and I have offered to the city of Ottawa to put a meter on every service in the city and pay a fair meter rate, and that if we were not able to agree on a fair rate we could leave the matter to arbitration. We are also using their sewers to a certain extent, and pay a certain amount for that. They say we should pay one-fifth of the total maintenance charges of the sewers, but we have not agreed to that. My opinion is that all public utilities, whether used by the Government or by private individuals, should be metered; in other words, that a man should pay for what he consumes, no more and no less. But the city says: No, we should pay for all our services on the basis of their method of taxation and upon their valuation of our pro'perty. I think we shall agree in the end. I am of opinion that there is a lot of ordinary politics in it, and no doubt in the next fortnight the city will accept the offer we have made them, which I think is a generous one.

might go further. I would suggest that in view of the fact that the sessions of Parliament are getting longer every year, and the fact that hon. members would undoubtedly like to bring with them their families, and as it is extremely difficult many a time to get necessary accommodation, the Government might provide apartments for such hon. members as desired to avail themselves of such accommodation. The members might occupy the apartments for the period of the session, or probably for the year, if they cared to, and could pay rent to the Government. Under such an arrangement they would know exactly where to go when the session convened, and the House might sit for four or five or six months without the inconvenience that members suffer at present by inability to have their families with them because of lack of accommodation.

manner in which the hon. member for Ottawa (Mr. Fripp) has discussed the matter. I realize that it is a matter somewhat personal to him and one which is of interest to his constituents. I think I have approached it in the fair spirit of the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and that I have even gone very much farther because I realize that the city has grown larger and that the world has advanced in ten years. Whereas Sir Wilfrid Laurier made an arrangement for the payment of $100,000 to the commission, I have offered $150,000 a year, and whereas he made an arrangement for $15,000 to go to the city, I have offered $100,000 and the right to tax the Civil Service which will represent about $50,000 or $75,000. It seems to me that, if you are going to make comparisons, I certainly have not been less generous than was the gentleman who has been referred to.
I do not want to discuss it any further than is necessary but I want to state to my hon. friend that the remarks which I made about the work done by employees were made from personal experience and knowledge, and not from hearsay. Of course, I have not had an opportunity of watching these men in a great proportion of their work, but I have had an opportunity of seeing With my own eyes certain things in the year and a half that I have been connected with the department, and I want to tell him that I would not feed some of these men for what they are doing. I would not have them on my premises at all. Why, the Speaker of the House told me only yesterday that he had a lot of these men repairing a room for him-one little room that a man would paint in one-half or three-quarters of a day. Yet six or seven men spent four or five days on the work. Wherever you go it is the same thing.

There is something to be said in favour of it, but its adoption would wipe out the municipal government in Ottawa as well as the individual citizen, so far as active participation in municipal affairs is concerned. In Washington the matter is left in the hands of a fcommission appointed by the Government. The Government pays a very large part of the cost of administration-I think one-half-and the citizens of Washington, unless there has been some change of late, pay the other half, and have no representation or voice in the administration.

I have often been struck by the waste space in some public buildings outside of Ottawa. If you go to some customs buildings you will see more than ample room for the

requirements of the work, and yet the agent at that point will insist that he barely has enough room. I have been in customs houses in small cities where the building was large enough for a city five times its size. The Government might do well from an economical standpoint to have an independent inspector look over these buildings with a view to seeing if they could not find space for more departments of public service than those for which they are now used. The hon. minister has been doing that to some extent, because in my own city he has put a number of offices into the customs building.

I will go so far as to criticise the policy that has been in vogue for a great many years of having too big examining warehouses which were not properly arranged for office purposes, involving a great waste of space,
I will not say of public money, because the buildings no doubt actually cost the money paid for them. The most notable example is the city of Calgary. In the customs warehouse there, there is enough waste space to take care of the post office of that city, for which we are going to spend $750,OflO to put up a building.

We have adopted the policy for the last year and a half that as these leases fall due we renew them for not later than the first of May. 1920, and in many cases not later than next December. The reason is this: The Hunter building will be completed, we hope, in July and certainly in August. That will provide about 140,000 square feet of floor space, and will house a great many civil servants now accommodated' in other parts of the city. But as there are some new departments being established, such as the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, the Land Settlement Board and the Income Tax office, the idea is to have a general rearrangement of the offices of the different departments when the Hunter building is finished. We have rented the whole of what is called the Rea or Daly building of which we get possession on the 1st of July. So that in July or by the 1st of August we hope to be able to make a re-arrangement by which we shall have each department in one place. I am sorry to say that two important departments will still be distributed in sections in different places around the city, but we are making very short term leases and hope within the next year and a half, at the outside, to get rid of a great many buildings now under lease and to reduce to quite an extent the amount of rental paid in Ottawa.

minister considered the unit system in the organization of Government offices to conserve space, and do away with so many partitions and doors in the buildings? It seems to me, in going through the departments as they exist at the present time, that one of the great difficulties is that the buildings were never designed as office buildings. Looking at the Hunter building from the outside it does seem to me to be the first approach to a successful modern office building that has ever been designed in connection with the Government service in any part of Canada. If it is carried out on that system it will not only conserve space but it will ultimately result in reducing the cost of the entire office staff.

I agree that this is the first attempt that has been made in Ottawa to have a real office building. The building is constructed on the unit basis. There are nine floors all practically alike. The only difference is that there is a well in the centre 100 x 50 feet. The building is 200 x 150 feet. That gives a row of offices all around the position of the well 50 feet wide. There is an 8-foot passageway which leads between two 20-foot offices, one on the outside and one on the inside. The great long corridors have been divided up according to the necessities of the departments intending to use them. Some of the space may be divided up into rooms 10 x 12 and in other cases there will be rooms from 30 to 50 feet long. We have consulted several departments which are going to use the different floors and have divided and partitioned the space according to the arrangements of these departments.
As to the future, I think I suggested on .a former occasion that it would well repay any member of the House of Commons to take a forenoon, go to Mr. Ewart's office and see the models which he is preparing for the new building which we all hope in the not-too-far-distant future to see erected on the expropriated area on Wellington street. That idea is being carried out there exclusively. We propose to adopt the unit system in .so far as the unit system can be applied to that building. The first unit will contain the Supreme Court room, and after that there will be a series of office buildings practically all built upon the

same general plan to carry out the idea that my hon. friend suggests.

I suppose that there is no clause in any Bankruptcy Bill or any assignment and preferences -act which causes as much trouble to the bar, the public and the courts as the question raised in section 31 of the present Bill. It is drawn with the purpose of avoiding anything like a preference as between creditors, and at the same time with the idea of protecting whatever is a bona fide transaction. The first part of the clause is an adaptation of section 44 of the English Bankruptcy Act. It goes a little further than the language of the English Bankruptcy Act, and so do many of the Statutes of the provinces of Canada. We have declared in section 31, as drawn, that where a transaction is entered into with a view to giving a creditor preference over other creditors it shall be null and void, or where a transaction is one which has the effect of giving such creditor a preference over the others it shall be void as against the trustee. These last words are not in the English section but have been for many years in the Ontario Act, and, I think, in the Acts of a great many of the provinces of Canada.

An attempt was made in subsection 3 of section 3! to extend the law considerably because in that the drafter of the Bill undertook to define what should be deemed to have the effect of giving a creditor a preference. That is going a step beyond any legislation on the subject of bankruptcy as far as I know. A great many protests were received in regard to subsection 3. Many of the ablest lawyers have communicated .with me on the subject and various commercial bodies have also sent their representations. Upon the whole, I am inclined to think it would be wiser simply to eliminate subsection 3 altogether and in its place to substitute a clause which will be section 33 when we come to that section.
I therefore move that subsection 3 of section 31 be struck out.

had better be left alone.

There may be men who are obliged to go on the bench because they are not able to make a living at the bar and in addition have gone behind. These men might be forced into bankruptcy and no judge could possibly continue to occupy his position under such circumstances. The remark that the Solicitor General made to the effect that these people should not be above the law has no force, for the reason that you make them amenable to the law if they wish to take advantage of it by voluntarily applying to be put in bankruptcy. There will be nothing in this section, if amended, to prevent any person from taking advantage of the Act and voluntarily going into bankruptcy.

Mr. JOHN A. STEWART: The question of affixing the stamp was very fully canvassed when the Act was passed. The retail drug trade, as well as the manufacturers, were heard and the present practice was the result.

I am giving you the argument advanced at the time. If the stamp were affixed by the manufacturer the cost would be added to the invoice price and would be paid for by the druggist when he paid for the goods. Therefore the druggist would have a capital investment of the value of the stamps affixed to all articles on his shelves which were liable under the Act; and, this being a war tax, when it was repealed, as it logically would be at the conclusion of the war, the druggist would still have everything on his shelves stamped which under the Act had been subject to this stamp duty, while the purchaser of new goods subsequently purchased would be relieved of the amount of the tax. That was the consideration that carried weight, and I have reason to believe that many of the retail druggists are not averse to the present practice. There is no possible question, though, that the tax might very well come off altogether, because it is stated that 62i per cent of the revenue has 'gone in expenses of collection and inforcement. There is undoubtedly a very strong agitation on the part of retail druggists to have the tax done away with altogether. But I have reason to believe there is some difference of opinion in regard to any change in the manner of collection if it is to continue, for the reasons I have stated.

Mr. PETER MoGIiBBON: I do not think my hon. friend (Mr. Sheard) has grasped the point at all.

Very seldom does he do any wholesale business. If he has to pay $2 for the registration of the formula of each of these remedies it is a fairly heavy tax, and at the maximum would mean $30. The wholesale druggist may be manufacturing two or three lines, but selling thousands of dollars worth, and only paying a tax of $4, $6, or $8, while the retail druggist is paying two or three times that amount on his small sales. It may be an argument that the Act cannot be enforced against retail druggists. But if it is enforced over every part of the country as strictly as any other Act is enforced, I think it will work a great injustice against retail druggists who manufacture their own lines of patent medicines.
Mr. ANODER'SON:	If a druggist puts
these prescriptions on his counter, and a person comes in complaining of bronchitis, and the druggist says, "" I have a remedy,"" and hands him a bottle from the counter, he is practising medicine contrary to the Act.

He will try to multiply his patent medicines in order to

make the people swallow them. If we impose a tax of $5 or $25 on each patent medicine he wants to put on the market he will be a little more careful about it. I propose to amend that section by substituting the word ""five"" for the word ""one"" so as to make the tax $5 instead of $1. You have Wampole's cod liver oil and Wampole's hypo-phosphate; they pay only $1 a year and they perhaps make millions of dollars out of them.

If this Act is going to operate in this way, how much does the minister think that he is going to get out of it? He will get millions of dollars. The druggists are paying for it whether the patent medicine is manufactured by Sharpe & Dohme, John Weyth & Company or the other manufacturers. This is looking at the question from the druggists' point of view. All those proprietary medicines that we see on the druggists' shelves are made in the same way by such manufacturers I have mentioned.

They say the sale of patent medicines should be controlled by imposing a higher fee.

My only object in suggesting a change of the amendment is that the interests of the retail druggists shall not be unjustly affected. If the Bill is passed in its present form the retail druggist who manufactures his own line of patent medicines and sells them in very small quantities, is going to pay a very large proportion of the revenue derived from this business. I think that revenue should be collected from the large manufacturers of patent medicines. It may be interesting to the Committee to know that patent medicines to the amount of $20,035,954 were manufactured last year in Canada, which, when resold to the consumer, would probably bring in a return of $30,000,000 or $40,000,000. This great quantity of patent medicines was produced by the large manufacturers, and I think they ought to pay a higher fee for each article they produce than $1. On the other hand, the retail druggist should not be taxed over one dollar for each article which he puts up and sells as a patent medicine. I would suggest that the retail druggist be exempted from this fee and that he simply have to pay his registration fee of two dollars. I have shown that the tax is not equitable as between the retail druggists and the large manufacturer.

Whether they are good or harmful in their effect, the fact remains that a great many people believe they derive benefit therefrom and therefore have recourse to .these medicines to a very large extent. As has been said by the preceding speaker, if a higher license fee were imposed it would result in increasing the price of patent medicines, with the result that the masses will experience more difficulty in purchasing them and will labour under a sense of injustice.

A very wrong impression is apt to be created in the mind of the public by the resolution which associates derivatives of coal tar with opium. There are many of the derivatives of coal tar in very general use not only under prescriptions from practising physicians but on sale to the public. As to their effect on young children, tha-t is a matter on which members of the medical profession in the House are more competent to judge than myself. But in associating the derivatives of coal tar with opium, I think an entirely wrong impression is likely to be created as to the injurious effects of these coal tar derivatives. This is particularly objectionable at present. There is no branch of research that is likely to produce more useful preparations than the future development of the coal tar industry. I suggest that if in

the opinion of the medical men certain of the coal tar derivatives could be used without injury, they should be permitted for children up to the age specified in the amendment, provided that the preparation was approved of by the Advisory Board as being 'harmless to infants over a certain age.

, member for Beauce. I think we should put on the statute-book a distinct and positive limitation to the general sale of opiates and narcotics of that class, especially when they are sold in such a way as to be procurable by nurses and those having the care of infant children.
The ordinary soothing syrups that are sold so commonly in the drug stores owe their value largely to the opiate and morphine which they contain. These are readily purchasable, and they can be readily procured by unscrupulous or careless nurses for the sole purpose of securing quietness on the part of an infant, irrespective of the harm they do. The apprehensions which have been expressed by various members of the House are weU grounded, and I think strong legislation should be provided so as to prevent the general sale of these articles. Nearly the whole of the so-called soothing remedies for children owe their pernicious influence to the opiate derivative in the form of codeine and morphia which they contain. I think there is something in the exception taken by the hon. member (Mr. Steele) to linking up, particularly the preparations of coal tar with opium preparations. If you can link up coal tar derivatives, carbolic acid and other preparations, which are very largely family medicaments, or which are used for various disinfecting purposes, it is a question how far we should go in that particular inclusion. I think that might be reconsidered and we might specify more accurately what particular preparations of coal tar should be included. The family of coal tar products is a very large one. I am not sure that it would not include many of the analine dyes and preparations that are not medicinal at all. Certainly it would include many of the ordinary domestic disinfectants', which are used as disinfectants pure and simple, sometimes by the gallon. I do not suppose it is the intention of the Act to prohibit their employment in that connection, and yet they might be construed to be included in coal tar products or derivatives under this Act.

The other evening the member for Brome asked why phosphoric acid or phosphorus was stated in terms of ammonia and in reply to him I said that in the trade phosphorus or phosphoric acid was so expressed. Superficially, that might amount to a contradiction in terms. Ammonia is recovered as a by-product in the manufacture of gas from coal, hut the greater proportion of ammonia is nitrogen. In 17 pounds of ammonia 14 pounds would be of the other ingredient. The technical officer of the department has never been in favour of expressing this particular ingredient in the terms of ammonia; and he has always been willing and anxious to use the term nitrogen. In many countries the term nitrogen is used instead of ammonia, and since our discussion on this Bill the other night he has expressed a preference for an amendment. I am of the same opinion and move that the word ' nitrogen ' be inserted instead of 'ammonia.'

represent the city, I cannot allow some of the remarks which have been made to pass without objection. In the first place, I Would point out to the Minister of Public Works (Mr. Carvell) that he is in error when he casts some doubt upon the quantity of work done by the men employed in his department. I have some personal knowledge of the work these men do, and venture to say that the working men and mechanics in the departments in Ottawa work as hard and as faithfully as those who work for private corporations.
In regard to the agreement which is now being entered into between the city of Ottawa and the Government of Canada I submit that (the amount which the Government propose to offer is entirely inadequate. What is the situation? One-fifth of the whole taxable property of the city is owned or held by the Government.
i

When a Government leases a building the revenue which the city would otherwise derive from that building and the land upon which it stands immediately stops. The result is that the Government, unless it is placed in the position of the ordinary citizen, escapes the payment of a large share of the taxation. I fail to understand upon what principle the Government should not be treated as all the other citizens of Ottawa are treated. If the Government had to pay the city of Ottawa, the amount of payment would be in the neighbourhood of $600,000 instead of $100,000 that they propose to give to the city under this new agreement. I am not speaking for the moment of the $150,000 which the Government. propose to give to the Improvement Commission, because the city of Ottawa [DOT] has no control over that commission or the expenditure of that money. The Commission is one appointed by the Government, it is responsible to the Government and it spends this money upon the parks and driveway which surround the city of Ottawa, presumably for the benefit of the people of Canada and incidentally for the benefit of the people of Ottawa. But, in carrying out the scheme of the late lamented Sir Wilfrid Laurier to make Ottawa "" the Washington of the north,"" it was suggested that this Commission should be formed independently of the corporation so as to beautify and make attractive the city for those who have to come here to do business. The city of Ottawa is to receive only $100,000 for the services it renders* What services does it render? It supplies water to the Government and, although the supply is not under meter, the best information that the corporation officials can obtain is that the Government uses water, if it were metered, to the value of nearly $100,000. There is no restraint upon the use of it in any way; they use what they want.
Mr. MoMAiSTEE: We do not even have hot water to wash our hands with.

531886,ca.proc.d.1919-05-15.4.2.68,1919-05-15,e702fa8e-c7e6-4906-a69d-bad38613f9e4,ca.m.6325,Mr. FRIPP:,,SUPPLY.,,,"That is not the fault of the city of Ottawa. Then the city gives fire protection. That is an important item. The Government uses the sewers of the city; and there are other services supplied which if supplied to a private individual or a resident would cost that individual from $50,000 to $100,000. Why should the rest of the people pay for the services rendered to the Government of Canada? I hope the Minister of Public Works and the Committee who are still dealing with this question will further consider a more
159i
reasonable settlement in connection with the items I have mentioned.
It is true that there has to be set off against the extreme amount, say, $600,000 or $800,000 a year, the advantages that the city derives from the fact that it is the Capital. There is no doubt that there are numbers of people who come here on Government business who would not come to Ottawa if it were not the Capital, and that a certain amount is spent and business is increased by that fact. But I think if the matter were gone into carefully and fairly with the view of placing the arrangement with the city of Ottawa upon a business basis, we ought to receive at least $300,000, allowing for all those other incidental advantages which are brought to the city by reason of the fact that it is the Capital of Canada.
I still hope and trust that, notwithstanding what the minister has said, he has not yet made up his mind not to meet the city, and its position as stated by the mayor, more fairly, from the point of view of the city, at all events, and make an amicable arrangement upon the basis of the value of the services rendered.
I would ask the Committee to remember that one-third of the people of Ottawa including their families, are Government employees and that the city loses a large sum of money that it would not lose if these people were engaged in some other industry. If we could have an industry in Ottawa employing 15,000 men and women we would gain,, it is quite evident, not the amount that the Government has proposed to pay, but a much larger sum in return for the services rendered in connection with water, fire protection, sewerage, and hospitals. We supply the hospitals for the city of Ottawa and these are used by the civil servants. The Government indirectly gains a benefit in that respect. We could tax their incomes, but the cost of collectr ing the income tax from the Civil Service would probably eat into a large portion of the revenue derived from that source. The arrangement heretofore has been that the city should not collect the income tax from the civil servants, it being, in a sense, paid by the Government under this arrangement.
I can only commend to the Minister of Public Works the spirit of the late lamented Sir Wilfrid Laurier and express the hope that he will follow in his footsteps in his desire to make Ottawa, what it should be, as the Capital City of Canada, and to make it really the city of the whole people. If

my hon. friend will adopt the spirit of the late lamented gentleman of whom I have just spoken, I am sure that a better, a fairer arrangement can be made with the city of Ottawa than that which, apparently, the minister proposes, namely, the payment simply of $100,000 into the treasury of the corporation.

531580,ca.proc.d.1919-05-15.3.3.29,1919-05-15,a8b2b613-dd5c-4a22-8f22-c0e4f180c7b6,ca.m.4552,Mr. GUTHRIE:,Solicitor General of Canada,SUPPLY BILL.,BANKRUPTCY ACT.,,"Perhaps I might be permitted to make a short explanation in regard to section 29 for the benefit of some members of the Committee who are not lawyers. These three subsections are somewhat intricate and drawn in legal and technical language. The object of them is to avoid certain settlements commonly known as voluntary or fraudulent settlements as against creditors, and at the same time due care has, I think, been taken to protect all genuine, bona fide settlements entered into for good consideration and for laudable purposes. Section 29, subsection 1, applies to what I might call settlements which have been made and completed prior to bankruptcy. There are three classes of settlements to which it was not applied. First, it does not"" apply to a settlement made before and in consideration of marriage; second, it does not apply to a settlement made in favour of a purchaser or incumbrancer in good faith and for valuable consideration; third, it does not apply to a settlement made on or for the wife or children of the settlor of property which has accrued to the settlor after marriage in right of his wife.
With these three exceptions it applies to all other voluntary settlements, and if they are made within one year of the date of the bankruptcy such settlements are to be void against the trustee. If the bankruptcy happens within five years of the date of settlement they will be void against the trustee unless the parties claiming under the settlement can prove the following: First, that the settler was, at the time he made the settlement, able to pay all his debts without resort to the property which comprised the settlement; and, secondly, that the interest of the settler in the property passed out of his hands at the time of settlement. Subsection 2 seeks to avoid as

preferences certain marriage convenants or contracts which are not uncommonly made in this country, but which are more prevalent in- -Great Britain, that is; covenants or promises made in consideration of marriage that at some future time the husband or the wife, as the case may be, will settle on the other party property of some kind, either in money, securities or in land. Subsection 2 provides that any covenant or contract to settle at a future time made by a person in consideration of his or her marriage, either for the future payment of money for the benefit of the settlor's wife or husband or children, or foT the future settlement on or for the settlor's wife or husband or children, of property wherein the settlor had not at the date of the marriage any estate or_ interest whether vested or contingent, shall be void as against the trustee, except within certain very stringent limitations. Subsection 3 applies to any payment of money or any transfer of property which may hereafter be made -by the settlor pursuant to any promise or -covenant made before marriage. These sections apply only to settlements hereafter made. We do not seek by this clause * to interfere with settlements which have been made, or covenants or promises which have been entered into prior to the coming into operation of this Act, But for the future, covenants or contracts entered into for the settlement of property in consideration of marriage will, speaking, generally, be void in the case of bankruptcy as against the trustee for the creditors. That is the object sought to be attained by section 29 and the three subsections. It is merely carrying into effect, and perhaps extending a little, a principle which has been known to English law from at least the days of Elizabeth, because it is under the statute of XIII Elizabeth that we first find any law in regard to voluntary or fraudulent preference or conveyances. Away back in the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was enacted that any conveyance which has the effect of hindering, defeating, delaying, or defrauding a creditor is void unless it be made for good cause and be bona fide. We have carried that law up to the present time in Canada and in all the provinces of Canada. This section 29 is merely declaratory of the extent of that law, and expressly states in what limitations certain settlements and covenants will be upheld in the future as against a trustee in bankruptcy. I move as an amendment to subsection 3 of section 29 that in line 47, after the word "" insurance,"" the following wmrds be inserted:-

In -favour of the husband, wife, child or children of the settlor.
The effect of this will be that no policy of life insurance in- favour of the husband, wife, child, or children will be attacked as preference. That, I think, is in accordance with modem law on the subject, where these various parties are recognized in matters of insurance as privilege persons.
