I exculpate the minister; I know him too well to believe that he would do anything of that kind; I do not think he knew about it. But the job was put up

somewhere and this man was foisted on the country at an increased salary. I omitted to say that this splendid old man Cbnner, told me that had they put a returned soldier in there, he would not have said a word; he would have been perfectly happy. But to know that another man had been put there at twice his salary, on the ground of ""economy,"" made his Scotch blood boil- and I do not wonder.

What has the minister in mind now as an inducement to immigrants to come to Canada? Of the immigrants that came last year-some 60,000-how many went on the land? I would like to know the minister's views in regard to settling immigrants on land more than fifteen miles from a railway. Are immigrants permitted to settle on any Canadian Government land regardless of distances from railways? The minister would hardly suggest that the strike in Winnipeg is an inducement to labourers to come to Canada, nor would it be contended that the high prices of lands adjacent to railways in Western Canada and held by speculators is in the nature of an inducement. If this department is not in a position to do immigration or colonization work we should re-name it, and vote sufficient to provide for the policing of the boundary, as the minister has pointed out. We should know what we are voting for.

In addition to bringing people to the country, there has been cast upon the department the duty of closely scrutinizing those who nave been passing backwards and forwards between Canada and the United States. In that regard at least the department has never heretofore had as much work to do. The increase in the expenditure is necessary for that reason. As to immigration generally, I think there is very little chance of our getting many people from Europe in the near future. Shipping conditions are such now and will so continue for some time that we cannot look to receiving any great number of immigrants from Great Britain or from the continent of Europe. On the other hand, we are continuing to receive a very large number of people from the United States, which last year amounted to somewhere in the neighbourhood of 60,000. The year before that, the number was about 75,000, and I would not be at all surprised if this year we will have approximately from 75,000 to
100,000	residents of the United States entering Canada for settlement here. It is very difficult at the present time to anticipate what the condition is going to be in regard to immigration from Europe. I am inclined to the view that as soon as conditions become a little more settled we may look for a very large immigration from Great Britain, and possibly from the Northern European countries. As to that, however, one can only guess, because of the present unsettled conditions in those countries. I think we may look forward to a continuing immigration from the United States when we consider that country has now a population somewhere in the neighbourhood of 115,000,000, that the natural increase of population there is very large, and the amount of land available for settlement purposes is very greatly restricted. I think the natural growth of the population of the United States, in addition to the number they receive from outside countries, will have a tendency, for some years to come, to cause a very large number to migrate to Canada. So long as there is available in Canada large areas of arable land suitable for settlement I think we may expect that movement to grow.

Mr. iCALDER: It was provided last year that only returned soldiers should settle on Crown lands lying within a distance of fifteen miles from the railways. Outside of that, homesteading is still being carried on, principally in Northern Saskatchewan and Alberta. As to Eastern Canada, we are still carrying on publicity work as through our agencies in the United States. I understand that a number of people have been induced to come from New England and settle in Northern Quebec during the last six months or so. Our agencies in the Eastern part of United States have been securing very good results in the way of inducing persons to migrate to Canada and settle on lands. I am inclined to the view that the results in that direction will be very largely increased in the near future.

watching his administration of the department for the past year, and while during that period he has chopped off the heads of one or two of my political friends who were appointed to office on my recommendation some years ago, and to that extent I feel some regret, yet I have to admit that in pursuing this policy he has succeeded in effecting a very great saving to the country and in placing, as I see it, our immigration system in a much better condition than it was before. I think the minister was absolutely right, wherever he found an old Tory or an old Grit in office who had not enough to keep him busy, to dispense with him, and that is exactly what has happened.

whatever for any class of Mennonites who object to sending their children to the ordinary public schools, and I am rather surprised to learn that Mennonites in Western Canada raise that objection. I would not be at all surprised to learn that all Mennonites do not so object, because Mennonites who now live in Alberta came originally from Waterloo county, and in Waterloo county Mennonites make absolutely no objection to sending their children to the ordinary schools; I do not think the thought ever entered their minds to have separate schools for themselves. They speak a language of their own only amongst themselves, it being known sometimes as Pennsylvania Dutch, a combination of English and German. These people have lived in that county for a hundred years, and they have never raised any objection to their children going to public schools. Is the chief cause for desiring to exclude the Mennonites from Western Canada the fact that they are not inclined to permit their children to attend the public schools, or is it because of their objection to compulsory military service? They are moral, industrious, honest and make very desirable citizens, as I am sure any hon. member who ever came into contact with the Mennonites as we have them in Western Ontario and saw their farms and the result of their work and intelligence, will admit, although he might find fault with them for objecting to compulsory military service. As the minister states, there are Mennonites and Mennonites. Of the old Mennonites, there is an off-shoot called the New Mennonites who have somewhat different religious beliefs, and to my personal knowledge many of the new Mennonites volunteered for military service in this war. I have not with me a letter that I received the other day, shortly after the previous debate we had on the Mennonite question, but it was written by a man well known to me and he made this statement, which I have no reason to disbelieve, that in Toronto a certain Mennonite congregation sent to the front more men voluntarily than any other congregation in that ultra-loyal city. That must have been from the branch known as the New Mennonites, and there is amongst those who are now settled in Ontario a tendency to become more assimilated with the general population, that being especially the case when they go into the towns and cities. I should like it to be understood that if the Mennonites in Western Canada
object to sending their children to the public schools, there is a distinction between them and those living in Western Ontario.

gentleman to old settled regions in Western Canada where good agricultural land can be purchased at from $15 to $20 an acre. In the southwestern portion of Saskatchewan lands are held as high as $30, $35, $40, $45, $50, and even $60 an acre, but in Western Canada a great deal of land can still be purchased at from $15 to $20 an acre. That, however, is not the point. In dealing with the question of land settlement and colonization, we are bound to consider the fact that conditions vary greatly in all the provinces, and a policy that would be practicable for the Prairie Provinces might not apply to British Columbia or to New Brunswick. The problem is, after all, very largely a local one. The Dominion Government owns land only in the three Prairie Provinces; it does not own Crown land in the other provinces of Canada; and while the Federal Government should establish the machinery and the agencies whereby we may induce people to come to Canada, and while the nation as a whole has a very large interest in this problem, we must not overlook the fact that every provincial government that owns its own Crown land, outside of the Prairie Provinces, has a very large interest in this problem. It was for that reason that last fall we had a conference with the provincial premiers at Ottawa to discuss the matter thoroughly, and we decided upon the fullest co-operation with them. In a comparatively short time now, when the present abnormal conditions cease, I have not the slightest doubt that all the provinces in Canada will be quite willing to co-operate with the Federal Government so as to secure the greatest possible results in this field of endeavour. I am satisfied that with that co-operation, with a wise expenditure of money, we shall be able to secure large results in the way of immigration into this country and in the settlement of our vacant lands.

minister that we should have a very much larger population; but we have been getting immigration into this country for the last forty years, and I should like the minister to tell me, if he can-and I believe he could if he wanted to-the reason why we have not increased our population more rapidly, having regard to the number of immigrants we have secured and to the natural increase in our population. In the last forty years, we have lost upwards of 8,000,000 of our
1644	'	. 1
population by emigration. During that period we received over 5,000,000 immigrants, and that immigration, along with the natural increase in population, should have given us a population of at least 16,000,000 people to-day, but we have only about
8,000,000. Apparently our immigrants were coming in at one door and going out at another; we were simply a station on the way to the United States. If we kept our immigrants in Canada, the Canadian born people went to the United States. The minister has in mind increasing immigration, and that is a very good policy, but before he can hope to make a success of immigration and colonization, he must find out why people who come to Canada from foreign countries do not remain in this country. At the present time, there are over 1,000,000 Canadian born citizens in the United States, [DOT]and they have been going out of Canada every year for many years. The only time-that we held our immigration to any extent, was between 1900 and about 1912, during which period we made some progress, but previous to that time we were losing not only a number equivalent to our immigration, but a large portion of our natural increase. After 1900, we began to retain some of our immigration and some of the natural increase, so that in one census period our population increased by over 1,500,000. It is questionable, however, whether we have increased in the last ten years. The minister is asking for an increased appropriation to spend on immigration, and he must have in mind that when he gets an immigrant here he is to keep him. How does he purpose doing better in the future than we have been doing in the past with practically the same fiscal arrangement, the same form of Government and the same internal conditions generally?
What leads the minister to believe that people are going to stay here in future instead of going to some other country, as they have been doing in the past? What greater inducements have we to keep them here now?

They have not an acre of land within the limits of that province, and they have no immigration policy in regard to it. Consequently, when I am asked about the ownership of land in Nova Scotia, I answer we have no land. Under the Dominion Government, we have been for the last fifty years paying land surveyors to make surveys, maps have been laid be"" fore members of Parliament and the people showing the lands that we have in the different provinces, with different colourings on these maps, to indicate the lands we have for sale; those which are cultivable and fit for agriculture, the lands that are under the control of the minister, how much of these lands is owned by the provinces, and how much is available for settlement. Yet, the minister tells me I do not know what I am talking about, and that I do not know the state of things in my own province. That is no answer; it is a mere subterfuge. We would naturally expect the minister to be able to answer. Millions of dollars have been voted by this Parliament for the purpose of ascertaining how much
land we have in the different provinces and what amount of that land is fit for settlement.

If the Government will announce that their immigration policy has been changed and that it will now embrace the whole of Canada, that is another matter. But we have never heard that the policy of the Gov-

eminent with regard to immigration has been changed. I do not think that there is any authority in the minister's department to take the moneys voted by this House and spend them in any province in which the Government of Canada, as such, owns land. My theory is that these moneys are voted for the purpose of dealing with lands owned by the Canadian people through the right of this Parliament. No one realizes more than I do the great necessity of developing an immigration policy in Nova Scotia. In that province much splendid agricultural land is inviting cultivation. The difficulty is that there are industries to which the people go more readily than they go on the farms. They like to work in the coal mines, steel works, factories, and so on; they are not so willing to stay on the land. If the minister can do anything to make agriculture more interesting to immigrants or to the people who now live in Nova Sootia than it is at present, no one will more heartily give him the honour that is due him than I Vill. I trust that if it is the policy of the Government to extend their immigration policy they will have the greatest possible success in my own native province as well as in every other old province to which they may extend their energies.

But in Nova Scotia we do not produce more than ten per cent of the food that is necessary to maintain the people in those various industries. We buy Ontario 'beef and Prince Edward Island beef and agricultural products. It is pretty hard to keep a Cape Bretoner or a Nova Scotian at work on the farm; he finds it more congenial to take up other work. But farming may be made more attractive to these people, along the lines suggested by the minister.

Last year we paid our officials, placed at many points along the international boundary from coast to coast, $183,164. Salaries paid in the United States amounted to $82,013, and in Great Britain $67,072. In the United States we now have 22 offices which have been in operation for a number of years. These offices are at Detroit, Saginaw, St. Paul, Grand Forks, Watertown, Spokane, Syracuse, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Omaha, Columbus, Harrisburg, Des Moines, Biddeford, Great Falls, Boston, Bedford, New York, Portland, Manchester, N.H., Chicago and San Francisco. At each of these points we have a chief agent. There are twenty stenographers and six other clerks. The staff in these 22 offices number in all 48, and the salaries amounted to approximately $82,000. Last year we closed three offices in the United States, one of those three being in Michigan, one in Philadelphia, because we felt there was really no necessity for their continuance. As regards the result of the work in the United States, I said this afternoon that the number of immigrants that arrived last year in Canada was about 60,000, and in the previous year about 75,000. (In Great Britain we have twelve offices, eight in England, two in Scotland, and two in Ireland. On the continent all offices were closed shortly after the war. We had an officer in Antwerp and a staff in France. Our agent in France died some months ago, and no appointment has yet been made. The work in England during the last year or two has been confined very largely to repatriation in one form or another. During the past six months our staff has been extremely busy in connection with the re-

turn of soldiers' wives and children to Canada, and the staff at London has had to be increased in order to take care of that work. Our staff in the outside offices have also had considerable work. The dependents of our soldiers are pretty well scattered over the United Kingdom and there is a good deal of work involved in arranging for transportation and so on. The total expenditure in the department last year for salaries was $544,000. We are now asking for an expenditure of $575,000. L cannot say at present what provision will be made by the 'Civil Service Commission in connection with the reorganization of our Outside Service. I do not know what schedules will be brought down. Our outside staffs will be re-organized and classified salaries will be provided, and I would anticipate that in the new arrangement some increases in salaries will have to be provided. During the year I have had to provide for a number of increases in salary. In our Outside Service there was no provision for the ordinary annual increase that the Inside civil servants receive, and when I came to look into the matter 1 found a great many anomalies that had to be adjusted in fairness to a number of first-class officials who had been in the department a good many years. We may as well be frank about the matter; we all know that in the past the Outside Service was to a large extent treated from a purely political standpoint by all Governments, and in the result many men in the service were not treated on an equitable basis. When I began to ascertain what was right and proper in these cases, I found it necessary to make many re-adjustments, and as a result our whole service outside has been very much improved. I think there is a better spirit, and I am confident that we are getting to-day in our immigration service in 'Canada, the United States and Great 'Britain far better work than has been secured for many years, simply because .these little matters which had been neglected for a considerable time were attended to.

According to my latest information-and I have made official inquiries- the Belgian Government will not, in the very near future, look with very much favour upon any effort made to induce its people to leave their own country. I am sure hon. members can quite understand the reason for that, because Belgium has also lost a large portion of its population, and conditions in that country, as a result of the war, are far from being what they should be and the Belgian Government are anxious that the country should be rehabilitated and put on a sound
basis agriculturally and industrially as quickly as possible. iSo far as all that class of immigration work is concerned, that is, as regards Belgium, France, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, all those countries in northern Europe, all that we can do at the present time, because shipping under any circumstances will not be available until after September or probably after even October, is to have a very careful review made of the situation. Some person must visit those countries and get in actual touch with the situation so that we may have first hand knowledge. When that is done, we shall have the facts and we shall know what action can be taken, tout until that review' is made I doubt very much if any action could be taken. Until our soldiers and their dependents are home-and that will take some months yet -there will be no shipping available for such immigration.

He began with $200 and, after the lapse of twenty years, it amounted to $600 or $700. He was appointed originally in connection with guarding the forest but afterwards became a customs officer, and for twenty years served this Government as faithfully as any man ever served his Maker. In addition to being a customs officer he performed duties for the Immigration Department at $100 a year. About the 3rd of last October he received notice from the Government that he was dismissed, and his dismissal took effect at the end of the previous month, so that he was removed before he got notice. I took the matter up with the Customs Department, and they wrote me a very curt note that the offices had been combined for economy's sake. Now we discover that his successor is receiving $600 or $700 a year as customs officer, and is paid an additional $600 a year by the Department of Immigration, whereas the man who served his country faithfully for twenty years at a salary of $600 or $700 a year was dismissed for economy's sake. I am free to state that I do not think the minister knew anything about this little job, or the Minister of Customs either; I think it is a little bit of trickery on the part of some official. Mr. Conner held the position for twenty years; raised a family of ten children in this country; farmed anywhere from four to five or six quarter-sections; bore the burden and heat of the day during all these long years; did his duty for his country and was proud of it; guarded the boundary just as faithfully 'as if he owned the country; and during the long term he held the office turned in every dollar of revenue he could collect for the Government. Yet he is dismissed and that dismissal took effect two or three days before he received the notice. The statement made to him, and also to me, was that it was done for the purpose of economy. Now we find when the showdown comes in Parliament that the salary for the new appointee has been pretty nearly doubled, and James Conner, a faithful servant, is turned adrift. I do not blame the minister, because I do not think he really knew what had happened; but if this kind of thing has occurred in many other cases it is no wonder there is great discontent among civil servants. I appeal to my hon. friend the member for Lisgar (Mr. Bolton), in which constituency Mr. Conner lives, to bear out my statement. The hon. gentleman knows him as intimately as I do, and

said to me that a more decent man did not live in the province of Manitoba. I think it is the most shameful treatment I ever knew to be meted out to iany official in this country.

Mr. CA'LDER: I have not been quite able to follow the hon. gentleman. It is true that we have made a net reduction at the rate of $98,000; that is, if these people had all been retired at the first of' the year, there would have been a saving in annual salaries of $98,000, but these changes took place at varying times of the year, so that there has not been that net saving. On the other hand, as I have already explained, we have found it necessary to adjust salaries in our outside service in Canada, and while any increases, have been for comparatively small amounts, they make a large aggregate. These adjustments would have had to be made anyway, and when the salary schedules are brought down by the Civil Service Commission still further increases in salaries will have to be made if we are to retain these men in the service. We cannot expect to carry on these services at tne same rate of salaries as were paid prior *to 1914, and consequently we must look for increases of this kind.

Now that the war has ended it is important that the greatest possible attention should be paid towards bringing immigrants out from Great Britain, provided that people intend to immigrate irom the old land, and I think much more atten-

tion should be' paid to bringing immigrants from Great Britain than from the United States. The policy enunciated by the minister this afternoon would almost lead one to believe that the old policy is still going to be followed of paying more attention to Western Canada than to the older provinces. I have always advocated that it is not in the interest of Canada to have immigration controlled by the Department of the Interior. I should like to know if anything is going to be done towards supplying men for labour, particularly for the farms, in the old provinces.

In other words, we must arrange now for the necessary publicity and propaganda work to be carried on to secure results some time hence. That work costs money. During the war our expenditure in Great Britain for advertising and publicity was cut down to practically nothing, for reasons which must be apparent. We have carried a certain small expenditure, but that has not affected the situation. To get results, you must plan ahead. As a matter of fact, probably the most effective work that is being done in Great Britain is the work we do among the school children. Practically every person who is interested in the immigration movement realizes that. The seed sown in the mind of the child at school will bear fruit when he comes of age. That class of work costs money, and we shall have to expend money in Great Britain in a fairly large way, and begin right now, because we are a little behind time, if we want to get results either next year or the year following.
I am very doubtful whether iwe shall secure much farm labour from Great Britain. Only some fifteen per cent of the population of Great Britain is engaged in agriculture, and every effort is being made by the State to keep every possible man on the land and get others to go on it. It seems to me, therefore, we shall have great difficulty in getting farm labour from Great Britain. I can assure the hon. gentleman, however, that every effort will be

made in that direction, because I thoroughly understand the need of that class of labour in Canada. I also thoroughly agree with my hon. friend that a large percentage of those people, if they can be induced to do so, should be encouraged to settle in the older provinces of Canada. Our policy shall not be sectional; it should be nationwide. In co-operation with the provinces we should endeavour to work out some plan whereby any immigration coming will be distributed as evenly as- possible throughout the whole of Canada.
Mr. RICHARDSON; I was told to-day that there was a demand for 5,000 farm labourers in Canada, but that there was great difficulty in getting men for the work. Should not that situation be taken care of by the returned soldier? Does he indicate any disposition to take up that kind of work?
Mr. ClALDER:	I do not know exactly
what the situation is in regard to farm labour, but I am told that in Western Canada it has very much improved, and that there is not the dearth there was a month ago. I understand the problem is being very well taken care of, but just where the labour is coming from, I do not know. 'Some time ago it was thought it would be necessary to import farm labour from the United States, but the situation has changed, and recently we have not had any request from the Western Provinces for a move in that direction.

regard to the prospect of immigration. The hon. minister says, not in the immediate future, but in a year or two or three from now. The expenditure has been made in Great Britain already. We have had an army overseas for the last four years that has been carrying on propaganda work there which is bound to have its effect in the immediate future. The majority of the men our soldiers have come in contact with over there in the army, so far as I can learn, have signified their desire and intention to come out to Canada if they can possibly arrange to do so. I do not think it is necessary to launch propaganda in the schools or anything of that kind. I -think the Department of Immigration will find that during the next few years, indeed, right in the immediate future, their efforts will be taxed to the utmost to take care of the people who desire to come to this country from Great Britain, notwithstanding all the efforts that may be made to retain them over there. There is a condition
1654	'
of affairs existing in the old world at the present time the effects of which no one can at present accurately determine. The condition of affairs in this country to-day is such that I can well understand the reluctance of the Government to take a stand that would aggravate it in any way. But we should not close our eyes to the situation; it is one that will have to be met. Canada is suffering as no other country in the world has ever suffered, for people to till its soil. Under the conditions that exist to-day it is absolutely impossible to keep farm help on the farm; they have been going into the towns and cities faster during the last few months than at any time in the past, notwithstanding the crying demand for men to till the soil. This is an artificial condition of affairs. You are eliminating competition in many walks of life in the industrial centres. Not only are you to-day threatening to limit or curtail competition in the rural districts, but you are being asked to enact legislation that will discourage production of foodstuffs. The demand is being made here in Ottawa, and in all the cities throughout Canada, that agricultural products should not be permitted to be exported from this country.
I could not help reflecting upon the statement made by the leader of the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie) this afternoon that only about ten per cent of the food consumed in the province of Nova Scotia was raised in that province. We are practically reaching that condition of affairs in the older provinces generally, and if this condition continues Canada will soon be an importing, instead of an exporting, country for many essential and important food products.
I have some figures here for 1911 which show that a very serious condition obtained at that time-and do not forget that the immigrants that come to Canada do not by any means all remain here. The report of the High Commissioner for Canada shows that in 1907 151,216 British subjects came to Canada, and 33,691 returned to Great Britain. In 1908, 81,321 came to Canada, and 39,866 returned, or almost fifty per cent. That was the condition of affairs which existed for many years. We have been boasting about the tremendous immigration to this country but it has been to a large extent only transitory, from one-third to one-half going back again. Since the war we have been at a standstill in this matter, and our agricultural industries have not only been stagnant but have been going back. It may be that we have increased production, but the agricultural conditions of the land, particularly in the

oia provinces, is most regrettable. The bad farming that has been carried on through these years in order to produce as much as was possible is to-day showing its effects, and the results in the future are bound to be worse than at present. If this condition continues and the price of labour in the cities and towns still goes up the cost of living will not be reduced but will go higher. No other result is possible from the conditions that prevail in Canada and elsewhere. I appreciate the difficulties with which the minister is confronted. Possibly he may have some well defined policy in mind which it might not be in the public interest to announce at this time, we may as well face the issue as it is. We have either to lose our present standing as an agricultural people, or we must put forth great efforts to the end that the people in Great Britain who intend to come *here shall be enabled to do so even if assistance must be given. That may not be a popular thing to say in the towns and cities, but it is a fact which will have to be faced. I am glad that the Immigration Department will be under the control of a minister who will devote his entire time and attention to this great and difficult question which will confront Canada from now on.

the only thing you can do with a prophet is to disbelieve him, and I must say that I do not anticipate the flood of British immigrants to this country that my hon. friend from South Oxford (Mr. Sutherland) expects. I do not know what conditions in Britain he refers to that are going to induce that flood. I was speaking to a commercial gentleman from Manchester a few days ago and he told me that it was tolerably well understood that in Britain they have already re-absorbed into civil occupation eighty per cent of returned soldiers. As an illustration of how that re-absorption is taking place, it might interest the Committee, who may not have noticed the figures, to know that in the month of January the shipping tonnage turned out on the Clyde was 15,000; in February it was 22,000; in March, 40,000; and in April, 86,000. I have given the figures without the odd numbers, but in thousands they are correct, or my memory has undergone a more sudden failure than I had reason to suspect. Eighty-six thousand tons constituted a record for April for the Clyde with the single exception of the month of April in which the steamer Aqui-

tania was turned out. I have given the broad fact about the reabsorption of returned soldiers into civil occupation, and a local illustration of what is going on there; and on these grounds I very much doubt if my hon. friend's prophecies will be fulfilled in the immediate future. It would be difficult for him to find an inducement for these people to come from the Clyde, where occupation is being taken up with such haste and avidity, to settle, let us say, in Winnipeg at the present time. I would rather stay on the Clyde, and so would my hon. friend if he were there. To my hon. friend the minister, whose patience and good nature have been the subject of my admiration since I came into this House shortly after eight o'clock, I would like to offer a suggestion, which is not of a critical kind, but is of a helpful and constructive nature, in regard to the getting of immigration from Great Britain. I want him to take advantage of his closer proximity to the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White), to impress upon that somewhat obdurate individual the need of an immediate, substantial and generous cut in the tariff against British goods. I wish he would explain to the Minister of Finance- and I wish -that hon. gentleman would give to that explanation the same wonderful concentration of mind that he shows when eating the heart out of a document or carrying on the omnivorous reading that we all know he does,-that if vessels from Great Britain were encouraged by a lower tariff to come here with British goods, there would undoubtedly come commercial travellers who would observe this country and see the magnificent opportunities it offers, and there would follow immigrants to this country. If he would only explain all that to the Minister of Finance, his Budget might send his reputation higher than it stands even at the present time, and might astonish us all. I may be mistaken, but I feel perfectly certain in my own mind that immigrants would follow the goods; that farmers would be made out of the immigrants; they would raise other goods from the soil to pay for the goods brought in, and we would have cargoes coming and cargoes going. Capital would come with both goods and immigrants, and you would build up a great trade and a useful immigration without a single agent in Britain-just by a simple method of cutting down the tariff. This could be accomplished if only we could first operate upon the mind of the Minister of Finance.

There is a range of general expenditures covering our offices in Canada, Great Britain and the United States for such items as rent, fuel, telephones, express, temporary help, and all other expenditures of that class. The heavy item in these expenditures is advertising and printing. Last year we spent $216,000 in advertising and some $34,000 in printing.
Our deportation expenditures amounted to $12,000; boundary inspections, $37,800; and general expenses $72,700. All told, our expenditures under this head last year were $501,900; we are asking this year for a vote of $775,000. Whether or not that money will be expended will depend very largely upon conditions. We may find it necessary to increase our expenditures in Great Britain. Our general expenditures there have been comparatively small. Notwithstanding what has been said by the hon. member for South Oxford (Mr. Sutherland), I am convinced that it is necessary that certain general expenditures should be carried on. While it is true that Canada has been well advertised during the period of the war, nevertheless we will find it necessary to carry on certain work there if we are to control immigration in any sense at all. Let me illustrate. It is estimated that at the present time, there is a surplus of
3,000,000 women in Great Britain. Let us take down the bars and invite these women to our shores and we will get them by the hundreds of thousands. It is very desirable, especially in the near future, that there should be a selection made, that we should not invite to this country people who are going to aggravate the situation existing at the present time. You cannot do that unless you expend money to control this immigration. While it is true
that thousands of people may desire to come to this country, we must see to it in so far as possible, that those who come are assured of employment. We simply cannot afford to have our cities flooded with people Who cannot secure employment. In speaking of the general expenditures we could very easily use $100,000 in Great Britain for carrying on very necessary work. We are also increasing our expenditures in the United States and II think probably here in Canada there is certain very useful work that might be carried on. We must consider the problem of endeavouring to get some of our people out of our cities and back on the land. If by a wise expenditure of money we can cause a movement in that direction the money will be well spent. While we are asking for an increased amount of something like $200,000, it is not the intention to expend that money unless we find there is an opportunity for expending it usefully. Last year we took a vote of $1,135,000 and I think our expenditures were in the neighbourhood of $1,000,000. We	have	under-expended the voteby	about	$130,000. It	is difficult
at this time, with conditions as they are, to forecast with any degree of certainty or accuracy what our expenditures in the field of immigration may be during the coming year. The Government must have some latitude in that respect. Conditions will likely change very considerably in the next three or four months, and we should be prepared to meet those changed conditions. If we find the situation such as to enable us to wisely expend money in that direction, the money should be available.

That does not necessarily mean advertising. There is one class of expenditure we are not going into at all now that would be most effective in carrying on immigration work, viz: through lectures and films. The suggestion has recently come to the department that in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, we should establish a service of that kind. If once established it is going to cost some money. I doubt whether we would be able to accomplish anything effective in that direction unless anywhere from $75,000 to probably $125,000 were expended. Yet, that class of advertising-because that is what it really is- would be the very best the Government could carry on. You can convey a message, or represent a scene through the moving pictures in a way that cannot be effectively done by other means. There is another class of work that has been cut off during the past few years in United States and Great Britain, and that is the use of lectures. We have not had any lectures given in the United States for some years past, nor have we had any in Great Britain, and it seems to me that if the opportunity presents itself we can very wisely spend some money in that way. The proposed increase in this vote is not entirely for advertising, although I think we will have to do some more of it. I am sure we will have to expend money on publicity work in Great Britain; but there are many other directions in which money can be spent for the purpose of carrying on very necessary immigration propaganda.

We have wrecks frequently on the Atlantic coast in Nova Scotia and I have never heard of this company operating there, or being of any service on that coast. As we are asked to vote $25,000 to this company I think it should be shown that some service that is worth while is being rendered. The Government steamer Voya-geur was in the ice in the St. Lawrence river below Quebec last January, and the Prince Edward Island ferry was called upon to take it out. But we did not hear that the wrecking plant of Quebec had shown up at all. I keep some track of these matters, and have not heard of a single instance during the past yea* in which this wrecking plant has been serviceable. I would not feel like voting for a.continuance of this subsidy unless the minister could show that some useful work was being done.

Owing to the aids to navigation by various governments for a number of years, and the depth and safety of the channel, we have had very few wrecks indeed in any part of the St. Lawrence channel. The Quebec Salvage Company are supposed to render assistance to any ships in distress from Quebec to Belle Isle and I think it would be a very unwise policy not to vote this sum. We have to keep a wrecking plant ready in case a large and expensive

passenger or freight ship should get out of the channel or run on the rocks. We could hardly say that we did not anticipate any accident, and it is no argument to say that we should not have a plant ready to help expensive ships because accidents are not frequent. With regard to the Canadian Government ship Voyageur, de did not ask the Prince Edward Island ferry to' go to her assistance because she would not have been of substantial use. Of course, she had considerable difficulty in getting from Quebec to Halifax in January but she succeeded, with the assistance that was given her by the Government ice breakers.
I hope the Committee will see the necessity for this vote. One keeps fire insurance on a building not because he is anxious for a fire but because of the necessity for protection. The same argument applies in this case.

I cannot impress upon hon. members too much the necessity of having this vote go through for the Quebec Salvage Company, because to be without a wrecking plant when there is such a large amount of shipping passing up and down the St. Lawrence -would be a very serious thing.

We have wrecks on the west coast of Newfoundland which must be attended to from Cape Breton, the nearest point, and around the eastern side of Cape Breton on the Atlantic where steamers sometimes have the misfortune to get into difficulties. It is no consolation for the shipmaster or owner whose ship is ashore at Gabarus, for instance, in

the eastern part of Cape Breton, to know there is a wrecking plant at Quebec, because that is too far away. The Government used to give a subsidy to the Dominion Coal Company, or as it is known now, the Dominion 'Steel Company, who had, and still have, powerful tugs of their own, and also had steamers but these were commandeered during the war-I presume they will soon get them back again. That company used fo assist wrecks and get a subsidy. I always thought until to-night that the subsidy was continued. I cannot very well understand why it was discontinued, because they were rendering very excellent service. Is there any substantial reason for the discontinuance of that subsidy?

But there is nothing for the Maritime Provinces, and so the item does not represent the facts quite correctly. However, I am not finding very much fault with that. If a subsidy is necessary on the St. Lawrence and the Pacific coast a subsidy should be granted for the protection of shipping on the Atlantic coast. We have more business on the Atlantic coast than there is in the gulf of St. Lawrence or on the Pacific coast. If you are going to give subsidies to wrecking plants in the St. Laurence and in British Columbia the harbours of Halifax and-St. John should have plants for the protection of shipping on the Atlantic coast. I would like to say a word of apprfeciation for what the Department of Marine and Fisheries does to help shipping on the Atlantic coast. Whilst we have no wrecking plant, if they have a steamer anywhere within 150 miles they send her to the assistance of a vessel
in distress. We have to give the department credit for that. They have rendered valuable service both around the Magdalen Islands and at other points. In the absence of the minister some few days ago I asked the Acting Minister if the department is sending a steamer to the Magdalen Islands this spring to help vessels there in oase they get into trouble. There are about a hundred ships up there. About three weeks ago there was a great deal of running ice about Grindstone island and at Grand Entry. It seems to me that if it is possible at all one of the Government vessels should be sent up there to look after these ships while they are in the North Bay and also fishing in the gulf of St. Lawrence.

Referring to the Dominion Steel Company, I have just been informed that the reason they discontinued work some four years ago was because they stated they no longer wished to perform any wrecking work, therefore the subsidy was no longer granted to them. Mr. Brookfield, who up to the time of the Halifax explosion owned and operated a large dry dock at Halifax, had a very modern and up-to-date wrecking plant, but unfortunately when the explosion took place his plant was destroyed. Another company, called the Reid Wrecking Company, are sending a wrecking equipment down to Halifax, and we hope before long to come to some arrangement with them, so that they will be in a position to look after the salvaging of any steamships off the Nova Scotia coast, just as the Quebec company does on the St. Lawrence route.

When we were considering the Estimates of the Railway Department I advanced the same suggestion in connection with the service which is to-day in operation between the south shore and the north shore of the St. Lawrence. Next summer, on the first of July, the Quebec and Saguenay railway will be finished and in operation. Therefore, the steamship service will not be as necessary as it formerly was. I think it would be well if the department were to place the Champlain on a new route, for instance, between Murray Bay and Cap a l'Aigle, St. Fidele, and St. Simeon, and then across to Tadoussac. The navigation is good for the steamers at all times, even in the worst season in the fall, and if this is done the people in the district will reap the benefit of the new railway; otherwise they will not have the necessary facilities to connect with the railway. Then once or twice a week, when the weather permitted, the Champlain could cross over to Fraserville and thus give accommodation to people on both sides of the river. At the time I put the question to the Minister of Railways he told me to take the matter up with the department, and that is the reason I have brought it forward to-night.

The Champlain could also touch at Cap a l'Aigle, St. Fidele, St. Simeon, Murray Bay, and across to Riviere Ouelle. It would be a nice round trip, especially during the summer, would pay well, and furnish

ample accommodation to all the people on the south shore.
We used to have a service between the north shore and the south, even during the winter, but the little boat that was there has been taken away.

I call attention to a letter I wrote the department some time ago during the absence of the minister and his deputy, with regard to the necessity of placing two automatic buoys in the bay and harbour of Lunenburg. Lunenburg is the most important harbour on the Atlantic coast, outside of Halifax; large numbers of ships go in and out of that harbour both in summer and in winter. But the harbour is not properly buoyed, and if the matter is not attended to there may be a bad accident. Ships come in in the middle of the night; sometimes when they get part of the way in they have to put to sea again on account of the weather. I have known ships to come into the bay, go out again and have to remain out four or five days before the weather permitted their coming into the harbour. The department should not hesitate at the expense necessary to provide one or two buoys in a harbour like that. The only answer I received from the gentleman in charge of the department at the time was that the Lighthouse Board would not grant my request. But I think that I know more about the harbour of Lunenburg than the Lighthouse Board does. Some of these ships have crews of twenty

men, and it would be a terrible thing if any of them ran on the rocks in the harbour and serious loss of life and property resulted.

I told him at that time that I had not seen the press report, but I have since advised him that it was due to three reasons: First, the owners had the ship destined for the port of New York, and not for the port of Quebec; second, the rate of insurance would, unfortunately, be higher if the ship came up the St. Lawrence route; and third, if one of those ships like the Olympic or the Aquitania reached the Beaujean bank at low tide they would have to wait until the tide would rise suffiicently to admit of vessels of their draught passing. But there is no doubt at all that the largest steamer afloat can come up the St. Lawrence river to the port of Quebec. There is ample water all the way along until they reach Beaujean bank, and if they .would wait until the tide rises they would not have any difficulty in getting over that bank.

In my county there are many lighthouse keepers, and a number ot them have asked me to endeavour, if possible, to secure an increase in salary for them. The cost of living, of course, arxects these people just as much as any other. These lighthouse keepers have to endure great hardships all the year round; most of them are isolated in little houses along the coast and subject to the perils of the sea, and I do not see why they should not have increases just as the deputy ministers and others. I am making this plea for these men in my county as well as for those in other parts in Quebec and elsewhere along the coast where the same conditions prevail.

At present there is only one light, and it is practically no assistance to vessels seeking entrance at night; it is an artificial harbour, and the entrance is very narrow.

I understand that a steamer goes down there once a year distributing oil to the lighthouses, and carrying officers of the department.

They are wharves that I always contend are used in connection with the Intercolonial railway. The only connection between the Intercolonial railway and the county of Victoria is from Iona to Baddeck. The Government built the Iona wharf for the railway, because the rails ran down on the wharf. The cars are shunted down to the end of the wharf and from the cars the freight is put into the boat. The Government accept freight
166i
in all parts of the continent of America for that point, and have to deliver that freight at Baddeck. They could never do without a wharf, and have built a very fine one at Baddeck.
There is no charge on the wharf at Iona where they receive the freight from the boat and from the railway while there is a charge on landing at Baddeck. These wharves are practically a part of the railway system and without the wharf at which they could land these goods at Baddeck the railway could not receive the goods.
I had that wharf built-at least that wharf was built when the Laurier government was in power and I had something to say about the patronage. There is a very excellent wharf built at Baddeck. The farmers and people generally,-particularly the farmers-complain about this little tinkering charge of 25 cents, 50 cents or $1 on their freight. It does not amount to very much but it does not leave the wharf free as it used to. The wharf at Iona is free and the same rule .should apply to the one at Baddeck. I have brought this up before, but I believe the same charges are still collected at Baddeck.

I am trying to make arrangements for another year, if at all possible, whereby we will either give pensions to the pilots in all the other principal ports or else the Government may refuse to ask Parliament to vote this amount for the Quebec pilots.

I think this was due to the system of patronage that existed, and may still exist, whereby too many pilots were appointed in the St. Lawrence, with the result that they were crowding one another, and the country had to take the load and bear it. I regard that as a blunder. I would like to see some arrangement by which this could be struck off altogether instead of spreading it all over the country. That would seem to me to be the better plan. We cannot afford to be throwing away money, as money is now very scarce. Economy is absolutely necessary at the present time.

I do not see how the Government can very well get out of the payment now. If the pilots of other parts of the country have not been able to secure a pension I am very sorry for them, but they should have looked out for themselves and asked to he included in this Order in Council at the time it was passed. It is not too late to do that now when Orders in Council seem to be so popular wdth the present Government. It would be easy enough to pass an Order in Council providing pensions for the pilots of other provinces, and I would not object to it. It is only reasonable that these men, after their long service for the department, should get some consideration. I do not think the amount should be reduced, and personally I would be in favour of the same consideration being extended to other pilots.

SINCLAIR:,,SUPPLY.,,,"In view of the fact that there is such a large amount to the credit of the fund, something more should be done to make provision for distressed seamen. For a number of years I have been bringing to the attention of the Government the case of the town of Canso and vicinity, where there is a- good deal of shipping but where no proper provision is made for the care of seamen. The banks lie off Cape Canso, and this port is the main refuge for fishing vessels. Large numbers of ships go in there for shelter, for bait, to land supplies, and so on. Many sailors frequent that port. Dr. McGarry has been appointed a physician there to give some attention to the sailors, but I am told by him that the department refuses to pay for the drugs. They give him a pit"" tance for looking after the port, which is quite inadequate, and then they compel him to pay for the medicine he gives to the sailors. He has taken the matter up with the department, but no attention has been paid to his letters. The price of drugs has increased enormously during the last few years, and it is not fair that the doctors should have to pay for them under these circumstances. The number of cases that the doctor at this port has had to attend to has also increased, but apparently no interest is taken by the department in the necessity for providing medicines for these sick sailors. The ship-owners are paying the money; the minister is accumulating the fund-I do not know what he is doing with it. But no improvement has been made, at that port at all events, in the method of taking care of sick seamen.

For service on the route that I and the member for Temiscouata (Mr. Gauvreau) have suggested to-night, it would be well for the department to see that the

boat is properly inspected and put in seaworthy condition in the spring, or even in the fall, so that she may remain on the service during the whole of the season when the people are most in need of her services. About the month of October the people on the north shore are absolutely cut off from all communication.

Let them collect so much from the fishermen, who are ready to pay a reasonable amount in order that they may get the benefit of the fund. There could be no better way of using the surplus at present to the credit of the fund than to improve the treatment of these sick fishermen. Although I am not a very apt politician, I remember that a policy of that kind was promised to the fishermen of that part of Nova Scotia a good many years ago. The fishermen were promised free medical treatment if they would support a certain party. If they offered that policy as an inducement, they must have regarded it as acceptable to the fishermen. I know that it would be acceptable to them; it would be a splendid thing for them. In my own port of Margaree, where there are perhaps one hundred and fifty fishermen, it would be a splendid thing if these men could have the advantage of the Sick Mariners' Fund; I amVure that they would be glad to contribute to the fund in order to obtain the benefit of it. I suggest very strongly that the minister, who is disposed to look kindly on these suggestions, give this matter every consideration.

There is an increase over last year in practically every item.

I find by page 72 of the public accounts that in 1908, when a large number of immigrants were entering Canada and we were carrying on an active propaganda in Europe and the principal cities of the United States, the expenditure of the department was only $960,000, whereas in 1917 it was $1,181,000, and in 1918 $1,211,000. The expenditure seems to be increasing with the decrease in the number of immigrants.

The expenses of the administration of the department probably are a little high, and the leader of the Opposition is quite correct in drawing attention to past expenditures when there was such a tremendous rush to this country. I wish to draw his attention, however, to this: A great deal of the trouble we have in Canada to-day is due to the fact that we did not have in former days sufficient supervision over immigration with the result that men came into our country who should not be admitted. We have these men to-day; they constitute the problem which the Minister of Immigration has to deal with. We are to-day paying for the follies of past administration, and I think- it is absolutely unfair to charge it up to the present minister when it is the men who preceded him who were guilty of the wrong-doing.
For my part, I wish to see a vigorous immigration policy continued. Hon. gentlemen in the East may be quite content to sit down and suck their thumbs and do nothing to help the country, and it looks to me as if that is what has happened in some localities in the East. In the past year I took a trip through the province from which the leader of the Opposition comes and also through New Brunswick. It was the first time I had visited that country, which I expected to see so completely filled with people that it would be without opportunity to make any large increase to its population. But I was amazed to find mile upon mile of what looked to me to be exceedingly good land, with apparently no settlers. The thought was forced upon me that the people in that part of the Dominion were awfully deficient in that element of virtue which we call progress. It is about time that the

Minister of Immigration from the West went down into that part of Canada to wake the people up a little hit, because it seems to me they have a magnificent country and they are making very little use of it compared with what they might. We in Western Canada do not intend to sit down and wait for immigrants to come in of their own free will under the system which has been followed in the Eastern Provinces in days gone by. We know that we have a mighty good country, and until we get it peopled we cannot expect to have the social conditions which we would like to have, because scarcity of population is very disadvantageous to contentment. We have 'millions upon millions of acres of fine land. It may be true that a great deal of this has gotten into the hands of private individuals under the wrong policy which was followed in the earlier days. But is the Minister of Immigration going to sit down and do nothing to overcome those conditions which have been thrust upon him? I say no. And if he does I can assure him there is nobody in the country who will more vigorously oppose him than I. I quite agree that the endeavour to get immigrants from the Western States is a correct policy.
The best .settlers we have in Western Canada to-day came from (Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Western States. Thousands of people are crowding in from the United States. These people are very much like ourselves. In the early days, when they started to come, they had a very peculiar notion of British institutions. Many of them thought they were coming to live under-well, almost what you would expect from the Czar of Russia of those days. They believed that we were a mere colony, and that we got our laws and everything else from the King of England. Of late their notions of Canada .have been entirely changed; they now know that they enjoy the same justice and the same liberty that they enjoyed in the United States. Hundreds of townships are settled by people from the American side. We are glad to have them, and I hope that the minister will continue the .policy of trying to induce such people to come to. Canada. There is any amount of land in Western Canada for thousands of immigrants from such places as I have mentioned, as well as for our returned soldiers. If we are finding a little difficulty in getting just the land that the returned soldiers want, that is noit the fault of the land. The land is there, and it is up to us to evolve a system under which it will be made available. I 164
am confident, from what I hear, that we will satisfactorily settle that problem very shortly. In the meantime, the Committee ought to give the minister a very substantial vote in order that he may further the objects of his department. I am quite prepared to give him a year in which (to evolve a proper policy, 'and to give him even longer than that to remedy the defects that he found in his department as a result of the maladministration of years gone by.

In my judgment, there is greater necessity for this department than there is for any other department in the public service. No matter of Government is of as much interest to the people as is immigration and colonization. When you consider what the condition is to-day in. Canada-I endeavoured to make that clear in the statement I made to the House when the Immigration Bill was brought down- you must come to the conclusion that this matter should have received the attention of the Government long ago. We should have had a department of the Government in charge of a minister of the Crown who was prepared to give his entire time and energies to that part of the public service. Why have we in Canada only about 8,000,000 people, while south of the line the population is about 115,000,000? Simply because the question of the settlement and development of this country has not been properly dealt with by past Governments. There is exceedingly important work to be done, and if that work is carried out as it should be and if the necessary appropriations are made available to the minister in charge of the department, whoever he may be, in order that he may carry on his work properly, results will be secured that will re-pay Canada a hundredfold for any expenditures that are incurred. The matter has been too long neglected. True, we had an Immigration and Colonization branch of the Interior Department, but scarcely any one knew it was in existence. One minister after another paid but passing attention to it, because he had larger and what he considered to be more important duties- to attend to. But if this country is to come into her own; if it is to be developed as it should; if we are to get the kind of im-



migration that we should, then this subject must not be neglected as it has been in the past. We have an abundance of room. Opportunities are lying around in every part of Canada, in land settlement as well as in the development of our resources generally. The problem which stares the nation in the face will never be satisfactorily dealt with if we pursue a niggardly policy; unless the moneys necessary for this work are made available, we shall go on drifting as we have gone on in the past. Other countries are looking for settlers. New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa know the value of this class of work and have been spending two or three times what Canada has been spending for the development of their countries. If we are to compete with them; if we are to get our share of the immigrants from the Motherland, we must be prepared to spend the necessary money.
The hon. gentleman said that I have not brought down the information asked for. Well, it is difficult to anticipate the range of questions to be asked on an occasion of this kind, but I endeavoured to give as much information as I had at hand, and I think I have fairly met the demands for information. I have been asked to bring down a statement of the quantity of lands available in every province. May I point out to my hon. friend that even the people in his own province do not know that? Not a single Provincial Premier or Provincial Government could answer that question. At the conference we had here last November, I suggested to the Premiers of the provinces that they put on their Statute Books at once a law providing for an inventory of the natural resources of their respective provinces. Some of them have done so; some of them have started to obtain this information. But at the present time, fortunately or unfortunately, neither the Dominion Government nor the Provincial Governments have real knowledge of the amount of land that is available for settlement in the different provinces. I trust that arrangements will be made by all the provinces at an early date to obtain full and reliable information on this subject.
I agree with the leader of the Opposition that some serious mistakes have been made in the past so far as land settlement in Western Canada is concerned. We have allowed settlers to drift all over the country and to settle in places many miles from railways; and the difficulties of the Western Provinces have thereby been seriously multiplied. If a plan could have been devised
IMr. Calder. ]
in the past under which settlement would have gone forward .as railway development went forward, it would have meant a great saving of expense and trouble in a hundred different directions. But I wish to assure the Committee that that is no easy matter. As long as vacant lands are there, it is most difficult to hold people from going on to them. We have such things as squatters' rights, and if those lands are available anywhere within fifty or sixty miles of a railway, and if they are first-class lands, the squaluar is going to get out on that land if he possibly can. That has been the experience in all the provinces of western Canada, so that I doubt very much, even if the Government desired to do so, it could have prevented settlement of that character.
The hon. gentleman also referred to the lack of land for Soldier Settlement. That, of course, had reference only to homestead lands within a reasonable distance of railways. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, there is an abundance of homestead land, although not all of first class character, but the great bulk of it is not within easy reach of existing railway facilities, and it was because those in authority here felt it would be unfair to ask soldiers to go to lands lying more than fifteen miles from a railway, that provision was afterwards made whereby those returned men might secure purchased land instead of having to go out long distances from railway facilities.
The hon. member for Pontiac (Mr. Cahill) referred to the price of land in western Canada and apparently thought I was far out in my calculation as to what lands were worth. I believe I have a fairly accurate idea as to what lands are selling and being held at in the West. Two days ago, I sold for $15 an acre a piece of land I had held for ten or twelve years, and it is not more than four miles to a railway and it is good average land. I will not say that figure will represent the average price of land in western Canada.

Those conditions are, of course, very broad and comprehensive, embracing a multitude of

things. We have not been losing our agriculturalists in this country. Those who have been leaving are mainly urban people; or, if agriculturalists have been leaving, it is because they wished to enter business or engage in industry. I presume that the very large emigration from this country has been very largely due to the rapid expansion of the trade and commerce and industry of the United States in every direction, which has made opportunities for our young men to enter business, and I dare say that condition will continue. I quite well remember when I visited my old home town in Western Ontario after living in Western Canada for some time, that the old boys whom I used to know had practically all gone to the United States to enter business, because the opportunities there were very much greater than in Canada. In my judgment, what we need in Canada more than anything else Is an increased rural population, and I quite agree with the hon. member that we must establish in this country-and this applies to the Provincial Governments and Municipal Governments as well as to the Federal Government-conditions that will make our rural people content and prosperous and happy, because unless we do that we can never succeed in holding them. The question how it shall be done is a very complex one. The Provincial Governments have a very large duty to perform in that direction; the municipalities, if you will, have also their duties, and the Federal Government has its duty to perform. The question of good roads has a very important bearing on the problem; the question of education, the extended use of telephones, the establishment of social centres, and a hundred and one other things have to be considered, and I am free to admit that the fiscal policy of the country also has a marked bearing on the question. But the main thing is this : If we are going to get and maintain a rural population in this country it is absolutely essential that all parties concerned should combine to make conditions in the rural districts such as will lead to the contentment, prosperity and happiness of the rural population.

It is all very well to induce new immigration, but if we continue to lose those we already have our last condition
DMir. Calder.]
will be worse than our first. An amendment has just been made to the Immigration Act which I felt was just a little too stringent, and I believe the result will be simply this: Some of our people in this country will convey to their friends at home news of the stringent regulations now existing and the disabilities under which they labour in this *country as a result of certain steps on the part of this Government, and then we shall not obtain the immigration we otherwise might have had. To-day we are pretty well circumscribed as to the countries from which immigration can be drawn, practically the only country from which we can expect-immigrants being the British Isles. One hop. member a week or so ago urged that no immigrants should be admitted from the southern countries of Europe. That suggestion was pretty far-reaching and was not adopted. The Central Empires, Germany and Austria, will no longer be permitted to send immigrants to this country. The manhood of France has -been so much depleted that there is no possibility of our getting immigrants from that country. I am very doubtful, indeed, whether we shall receive a large immigration from the British Isles for some time to come. As the minister must know, the United States to-day, instead of receiving immigrants, is losing its immigrants. It may be true that those they are losing belong to a class which the United States does not care to retain, but it may be otherwise. I saw by the papers a few days ago that already steps have been taken by no fewer than a million people in the United States to return to their old homes; I do not know whether all these people are aliens, or whether any or all of them were naturalized. The paper went on to state that an exodus was expected from the United States of
5,000,000 people. If that is true, I should like to know whether the minister has any knowledge of a similar movement among our population'. If it is true, it would probably not be the men who are settled on our western farms who are leaving, but the people from our cities and towns. After all, we have a population of only seven or eight million, and I firmly believe that the Government ought to make every effort to keep every immigrant who shows possibility of developing into a good Canadian, citizen. It would be a pity if the Government directed its energies towards bringing in one immigrant, while at the same time iit was losing two immigrants that had already settled 'here just for want of a little effort to induce them

to stay. Has the -minister any knowledge of any large amount of emigration from this country such as apparently is the case with the United States, and if so, what efforts are being made to retain these people?
I entirely agree with the minister that the one thing we want in this country is more people. We have a debt of two billions of dollars, and I do not see how we can meet our exceedingly heavy obligations unless we fill the country up with people who will develop its natural resources. I think our energies should be directed along that line, and we should also remove the restrictions under which the people of this oountry have been labouring for several years, in order that people who are now here will be content to stay and others who are desirable may come.

We shall have to be very careful with regard to immigration in the future and see that we build up in our western provinces, and throughout Canada generally, a real Canadian citizenship. It is appalling to think, first, of the number of native Canadians, and, secondly, of the number of immigrants who have been brought to Canada with good Canadian money, who have left this country during ithe la^t thirty or forty years.
Sir Richard	Cartwright,	referring	tothe number	of persons	who	hadleft Canada	within a	certain	period-I think	he meant	the decade
(between 1882 and 1892-said that Canada had lost as many immigrants, whose entrance to this country had been advertised and paid for, as the Americans lost soldiers during the whole of the Civil war. A Canadian has only to travel to Boston to find that that city is practically an annex of -Nova Scotia; and if he went to Chicago he would find there between 30,000 and 40,000 Canadians, both French and English, who, d know as a matter of fact, are a power in municipal and Congressional elections. Some years ago my hon. friend Senator Dandurand and I were delegated at Sault Ste. Marie to represent Canada at the semicentennial anniversary of the Sault Ste. Marie canal. In the afternoon we were called upon to address a gathering at which the Vice-president of the United States the late Mr. Fairbanks, was also present, and I was rather surprised when we were
requested to speak in French. To my profound astonishment I discovered that in that gathering of about ten thousand people there were at least 5,000 French Canadians. That was in the State of Michigan which is partly French. West Bay city and many other cities, not to speak of the city of Detroit, are largely populated with Canadians. And if you went to Philadelphia you would come across so many Canadians from Hamilton and London and Toronto that you would be under the impression that you were in Canada. In fact, the entire United States to-day is dotted with Canadian -Clubs, and you cannot go into any city in the United States in which there are Canadians to any appreciable extent without finding a Canadian Club. These clubs are fashionable.institutions. This will show that there is in the republic to the south of us a very large population of Canadians of both races and if what my hon. friend said a moment ago is true, and I believe it is, that we cannot hope to get from Europe as many immigrants as we got before the war, I think we should turn our attention to the Canadians who are in the United States, and who to-day, knowing the value of Canadian lands and appreciating their country as they do, would be only too pleased to return to their Mother Country if sufficient inducement were offered. I may speak particularly of those Canadians settled in the United States who belong to my own race-the French Canadian. I think I am within the mark in stating that there are in the United States to-day at least two million French Canadians. The largest French cities in America 'outside of Montreal and Quebec, are New England	cities-Lowell,
Fall River, and many others, where there are French Canadians in every municipal council, in every legislature, on the bench and in every profession. And I know from the members of the Canadian hierarchy that they are obliged to supply the clergy of the United States with French Canadian priests. The cause of the emigration of the French Canadian to the United States is very well known. First of all, the French Canadian is adventuresome, and was so under the old French regime. The Kiug of France had to enact severe laws to restrain the French Canadians, or Canadians as they were called in those days from leaving the settlements. The term ""French Canadian"" dates back only twenty or twenty-five years. In the old days, even under the French, there was quite a marked distinction between a ""Canadian"" and a ""Frenchman."" Montcalm in his letters to the min-

ister in France always refers to the Canadians as the permanent inhabitants of Canada, and to the French as the men in His Majesty's troops. We all know the history of the famous coureurs des bois under the French regime. They were always away from the lands in quest of the fur trade with the redmen and by reason of that peculiar love of adventure these Canadians were encountered in every part of the continent, in the Mississippi Valley, near the Rocky mountains, in the wilds of Kansas and down to New Mexico. Later on, under the British domination you found them in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and roving all over the continent. In the forties quite a large number of French Canadians left for California, lured by the discovery of the gold mines there; and again they were attracted by the discovery of the gold fields in Australia. Later on in the seventies, as the minister said a moment ago, the industrial unrest in Canada was responsible for a considerable emigration of French Canadians, to the New England States, with the result that in all these cities in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York there are large colonies of my fellow countrymen. They have succeeded, but it is surprising to know that a large number of those French Canadians would like to return to Canada. Better circumstances and a keener appreciation of the surroundings of the old homestead appeal to their imagination, and 11 know that if a real movement were instituted to draw from that large population some settlers to Canada, the hon. minister would undoubt-edlv find there a very interesting field. There are some societies and some members of the clergy who are deeply interested in bringing back to Canada as many as possible of that population, and I hope that my hon. friend will encourage that movement because it is a healthy one. The French Canadian is essentially a good settler. History proves that. Those Canadians belong to the oldest stock in Confederation and should be encouraged to return and settle on the old homesteads. There is one society in Montreal, and, if I mistake not, there is one in the city of Ottawa, and there is, or was some years ago, one in Quebec. The Quebec Government has done something in the way of subsidizing these societies, but as the question of repatriation is under the control of my hon. friend, I expect he will do his little share towards achieving what I consider would be quite a success. My hon. friend said a moment ago that the province generally did not know the value and extent
CMr. I.emieux ]
of their land fit for * cultivation. I believe his statement is right. It has only been in the last few years that we in the province of Quebec have realized the richness, the enormous value of our resources in lumbering, pulp manufacturing and wheat growing in the new district of Abitibi. Since the National Transcontinental railway has reached this far away region quite a population has settled there and I am told that this district is certainly full of promise. I know as a matter of fact that the Quebec Government intends to cooperate with the Dominion in connection with the land .settlement of our soldiers. My friend, the Premier of Quebec, was here on Saturday and I was speaking to him about Abiti'bi. He then said to me that his policy was to direct, as far as possible, returned soldiers to take up lands in that new district. The Government of Quebec has accepted the views which were expressed by my hon. friend at the last Dominion-provincial conference and are willing to co-operate with him towards the land settlement of our returned soldiers. Once more let me say that I expect that my hon. friend will do something towards the repatriation movement of the French Canadians. It is really sad to think that there are in the United States such a large number of our countrymen, not only French Canadians but English Canadians. This is a great loss to Canada and if we can induce even a small portion of the large Canadian population which has settled in the United States to return, I think it will be the best work performed by the Immigration Department.

It is only within the last week or two that I had a communication from Mr. Cumming, who is head of the Department of Agriculture there, and he was very anxious to know what stand we are going to take to assist settlement on the abandoned farm, or the semi-abandoned farm; that is a farm which is not cultivated up to its full use. They have that trouble in Nova Scotia just as they have it all through Southern Ontario. One of the real problems in the older portions of Canada, and not only in Nova Scotia, is the question of getting a real, live new settler who will take the place of the person who is working a farm in a half-hearted way. In addition to that, you have the abandoned farm.

Within the past six months or so I have reviewed the situation, and not very long ago I came to the conclusion that all those agents should be permitted to receive inquiries with respect to privately owned lands and. those inquiries should be forwarded to associations which have recently been created in Western Canada for the purpose of dealing with them. It is only within the last month that there has been established in each of the Prairie Provinces an association representing private owners of land, and we have made arrangements whereby all inquiries reaching our offices in the United States will be forwarded to those associations. As the Committee will understand, the situation to-day is very different from what it was ten or fifteen years ago when an abundance of homestead land was available throughout the West. The landseeker from the United States is to-day looking rather for a piece of land which he can purchase within existing settlements than for outlying homestead lands, and consequently, we are creating machinery, both in the United States and Canada, whereby the prospective land-seeker may be put in touch with owners of land who have them for sale.

those agents in foreign countries the min-

ister will find his way clear to appoint one in Belgium. We have already an agent in France; the Hon. Philippe Roy is the Canadian Commissioner in Paris, and as the minister stated a moment ago, after the tremendous loss of life suffered by France during the last war, we cannot expect the French Government to facilitate the work of any immigration agent, but in Belgium, I am informed, that there are good prospects for immigration. Before the war a movement was on foot to send immigrants from Belgium to Canada and the minister knows that the Belgians belong to the better class if immigrants. As gardeners around the Yarge cities, such afe Toronto and especially Montreal, the Belgians have done wonders, and if inducements could be put forward, I believe the refugees especially who are at present in England would willingly come to Canada. I think there are in the Northwest one or two Belgian colonies, one being in Manitoba. The province of Quebec has in Brussels an agent, Mr. Langlois, formerly a journalist in Montreal, who is, I believe, publishing a paper called ""Belgi-que-Canada,"" the first issue of which I saw the other day. The future seems to be very bright from an immigration standpoint, and I would urge upon the minister to appoint somebody in Brussels to act in conjunction with Mr. Langlois. Some years ago the Hon. Mr. Sifton, now Sir Clifford Sifton, appointed two agents in Belgium, and for a while we had quite a stream of immigrants from that country. If the Belgium is not a farmer, he is so thrifty and industrious that he is capable of adapting himself practically to any business in the country and from all points of view he is a very desirable immigrant.

The department was created in December, 1917. We then had an outside staff of 459. In March of this year we had a staff of 344, a decrease of 115. These figures were obtained in this way. We closed 21 halls and the salaries
of the officers who were in charge of these halls, and who were retired amounted to $8,590. Most of them were simply caretakers. I found these halls open and expenditures going on for fuel, light, heat, repairs and so on* while many of them were not used at all. In a number of cases not a single immigrant had been in these halls for months. Something less than ten are still open. I do not mean to say that if we find it necessary in connection with our work these expenditures might not increase again, but I shall see to it that these halls are not reopened or kept in operation unless there are immigrants to be accommodated in them. At various interior points, such as Saskatoon, Moosejaw or Regina, in past years, when we were dealing with homesteaders in large numbers, we found it necessary to have agenoies established. We have decreased the staffs of these agencies to the extent of fifty-two persons. These persons had been kept at these offices continuously .for years practically after the work that they were appointed to do had very largely ceased. They were retired and their annual salaries amounted to $50,070. During the war we found it necessary to appoint a number of officials whose duty it was to issue permits to those who were leaving Canada to enter the United States. We have retired twenty of these officers with an annual saving of $14,350. Our boundary staffs were also overhauled and as a consequence thirty-one officers were retired representing an annual saving of $31,300. A number of officials resigned, some were transferred to other departments, and one or two died. In that connection we retired thirty-seven officials representing a saving of $32,490. This makes a total reduction in our staff of 158, representing an annual saving in salaries of $136,800. That is one side of the account. We found it necessary to make some appointments.

Amongst those there were some officials retired where they should not have been retired. A further investigation showed that nine

of these men were absolutely needed. That makes a total of 43. Deducting that number from the 158 we have a net reduction in the Outside Service of 115 officers representing an annual saving of $98,340. In the United States we closed three offices and retired ten officials, the net saving there being about $6,000.

However, there is the other viewpoint: In the field of immigration you cannot always get results immediately. That is, you must carry on your publicity work in such a way as to so affect people that they will move probably in two, thsee, or four years from the time when they first began to read about Canada.

control over the provision that is made for

the shipping of stock from different ports? At certain seasons of the year there is considerable live stock shipped from the port of North Sydney to Newfoundland, and people there who are interested in the prevention of cruelty to animals complain very often that cattle are not provided with proper shelter. When they come by train and have to wait for a day or two or more for the boat, sometimes they suffer considerably through exposure and lack of proper attention. At the request of a gentleman from Antigonish who was in the cattle business I brought this matter to the notice of the Department of Agriculture last year, when. I was told by the Minister of Agriculture that the Minister of Railways had to do with such accommodation. I wish to bring it now to the notice of the minister as I see he is providing for something in connection with live stock at these places. Is there any person at the port of North Sydney whose business it is to inspect cattle that are shipped to Newfoundland?
Mr. BAlLLANTYNE :	The Department ol
Marine has no control over live stock that is landed on the wharves at North Sydney. Our regulations apply to live stock when on board ship. The Minister of Agriculture ,was quite right last year when, in his answer to the hon. member, he said that the taking care of cattle on the wharves at North Sydney was in the jurisdiction of the Minister of Railways. Our regulations with regard to cattle on board ship cover:
1-	The number of live stock the ship is adapted to carry.
2-	The number actually on board for intended voyage.
3-	That the arrangements for carrying live stock are approved by inspector.
4-	That the shelters or fittings are substantial enough to ensure safety of live stock for the voyage.
5-	That ship is seaworthy.
Our jurisdiction begins and ends in seeing that live stock are properly taken care of when on board ship.

I am very sorry that I misunderstood the leader of the Opposition in reference to his question as to the amount of land available in Canada for settlement. I was viewing the situation from this, and I think from the right standpoint; that the whole question of settlement and colonization does not apply merely to federal land, it is being equally applicable to all Canada. When the hon. gentleman asked if I had information regarding the land available for settlement I naturally assumed that he had in his mind the whole of Canada, not merely that portion of it which happens to be the federal domain. I wish to assure him that I was not endeavouring to escape his question by any subterfuge, because if the Department of Immigration and Colonization is going to prove of service to Canada, that service must be to the whole Dominion. It is not right that the Federal Government should pass laws and expend money merely for the settlement of those portions of Western Canada in which it has lands. It is from that standpoint that I have endeavoured to approach this problem, and it was from that standpoint that 'I had a conference last fall with the representatives of all the provinces in Canada and endeavoured to secure their co-operation in connection with it. It appears to me that what the hon. member for Maison-neuve (Mr. Lemieux) has said is quite correct; we have found a new Canada because in the northern part of Quebec there is valuable territory that we did not know existed a short time ago, and the same is true to a large extent of Northern Ontario. The province of British Columbia is in my judgment the richest province in Canada, but it has not had the agricultural development it should have. I took this matter up with the various provinces and endeavoured to ascertain their available land resources for settlement purposes; but I have found that neither here at Ottawa, nor in the records of their own Provincial Governments, was there anything like a reliable or accurate record of one of the principal resources that we have in this country-that is land fit for settlement-I endeavoured to prevail upon them as to the necessity of our getting an inventory of this land just as quickly as we possibly could, and all the premiers and their colleagues who were present concurred in that.
Some of them have already passed laws with a view to securing that inventory. In tackling the question of the settlement of Crown lands, lands in the possession of ithe provinces, and privately owned lands, we must first find out what we have. Notwithstanding what my hon. friend has said, I may point out that when I was in Nova Scotia I found Premier Murray and all his colleagues intensely interested in this question so far as Nova Scotia was concerned. We spent four or five hours together at Halifax, considering the problem from every standpoint. They realize that the land of that province is not being used to its full capacity; that good lands are only half used, some of them not used at all, and they want to devise ways and means whereby that land may at the earliest day be used to the full. So that in the old province, of Nova Scotia, where the Crown lands axe all gone, there is an immigration problem. We must not forget that the expenditures made by the Federal Government in the past for immigration and colonization have not been made for Western Canada alone. It is true that the majority of the settlers have gone into Western Canada, but in the propaganda that we carry on in the United States and Great Britain and that was carried on in the various countries of Europe, no attempt has been made to deal only with one portion of Canada. In any case, if that has been done in the past it certainly should not continue in the future. The Federal Government must be impartial in this matter; it must treat all paTts of Canada alike. We must have a national policy not a sectional policy. It is of the utmost importance that the closest co-operation should exist between the Federal .Government and the provincial governments; that in this House should deal with the matter not from the local but from the national standpoint, and that whatever work we carry on outside of Canada should be carried on from the national standpoint, not from the standpoint of settling only those lands in Western Canada that belong to the Crown.

I cannot see the necessity for making an investigation. Unfortunately, there are Mennonites and Mennonites and those who live in Western Canada know the conditions existing there. Some of the members of the Committee know that quite recently I received a visit from six bishops belonging to that sect, who stated that they represented some
10,000	souls in the three provinces of Western Canada. They belong to the old colony of Mennonites, that portion of the sect that is absolutely opposed to sending their children to the public schools. They have been in the West for thirty, forty, or fifty years, and as members of the Committee probably are aware, the Provincial Governments in the West have had all sorts of trouble in endeavouring to induce those people to take advantage of our public school system. Unfortunately, however, they have not seen their way clear to do so, and it is that very fact that has given rise to the agitation in Western Canada for the exclusion of those people from the country until such time as they are prepared to observe the education and other laws of the country. It is very unfortunate this condition should prevail, but there it is. I am well acquainted with many of our Mennonite settlements in Western Canada and with the people, and those who have broken away from the old ideas are law-abiding, moral living people; they have no bad habits; they are great producers; -they are making great progress from many standpoints, and they make very desirable citizens. But so long as a large section of those people hold out against coming under the education laws of the Western Provinces, an agitation will prevail to exclude them from entering Canada.

He answers by asking how much land we have in Nova Scotia. What difference does that make? There is this system of surveys the system of the allocation of lands, in the different provinces on which we are spending millions of money. We are ascertaining the quality of the land, the location and extent of timber limits, water-powers and everything that appertains to our vast properties in the West. Under these circumstances have we not the right to ask the minister how much is available for immigration and settlement? A minister of the Crown who is the head of a department whose officers are all over the country getting this information, and which has its agents working from coast to coast selling this land, should be supposed to be in possession of that information and it is hardly to be expected that he will answer a question of that kind by saying: Why should you ask for such information when your own department of coal mines in Nova Scotia would not be able to supply you with similar information. We have, as incidental to the department of the provincial secretary in Nova Scotia, a sort of a little side show in the form of the Department of Agriculture which is not a department by itself. It pays some attention .to immigration, but we have no well organized immigration department in Nova Scotia.
I am sorry that the minister should have replied in this way instead of answering my question as to the knowledge which we should possess in this House of what lands the Government have in the West. Hehasnot answered that question except by referring me to what is happening in the Maritime

Provinces. Let me say to the minister that it is essential to getting immigrants to come to this country and keeping them here that we should keep our word to them and deal fairly and honestly with them. I charge the minister with having knowledge of the fact that immigrants came into Canada under the pledge of a statute of this Dominion which told them: ""When you enter Canada and become naturalized, you become a British subject; the pledge of the King is handed down to you by that statute, which is that you shall always be dealt with as a British subject.""
We had thousands of those people in this Dominion in 1917, but notwithstanding this pledge the Minister of Immigration was a party to violating the statute, breaking the pledge of His Majesty the King to the King's subjects, by depriving them of the franchise. Instead of allowing those people to enjoy the franchise the Government disqualified them and told them: ""You are British subjects, you have taken the oath of allegiance, this statute guarantees to you all the rights of British subjects, but nevertheless we are not keeping the pledge of the King to you in extending and continuing to you these rights."" Far be it from me to say that you should extend any rights to any man who shows any sign of disloyalty to the King; I would be just as bitter as anybody in saying to any such person coming to Canada: ""There is no room here for anybody but a true loyal subject of the King."" But what are we to do in the case of a man who comes here and takes the oath of allegiance and behaves in an absolutely right and proper manner in connection with every duty he is called upon to perform. As long as such a man does that he is entitled to the due fulfilment of the promises which were made to him. There were thousands of people in Canada in 1917 against whose loyalty not one black mark could be found; all that could be said was that they came here from countries that are possibly now at war with us, but they took the oath of allegiance and have observed to the letter every duty which devolved upon them. Nevertheless the sins of the fathers were visited upon the children to the third and fourth generation; and the Minister of Immigration, knowing that these people did not deserve it at his hands, was a party to cutting them away from that which is deaTer to a man almost than any other right that he possesses-the right of participating in the government of the country in which he lives. I hope the minister will always keep 
in mind that whatever promises we make to immigrants coming to Canada shall be observed to the letter, particularly when we solemnly sit down here and pass a statute in which we grant certain rights to newcomers. That statute received the consent of His Majesty the King, and it then became the law of the land; and we should be very careful and have the very best proof that it is necessary to break away from the pledges and promises therein set forth before we adopt such a policy. I submit, therefore, to the minister that his department should bear in mind that people coming into Canada should be allowed to enjoy those rights and exercise those privileges which have been promised to them, so long as they will do and maintain on their part what is expected of them as British subjects. I submit that has not been done on the Government's part in the past, and it accounts to a very great extent for the smallness of the immigration entering Canada just now from countries beyond the seas. Because, the Britisher from the United Kingdom, although he is a British subject, does not like to see others unfairly treated, and does not caTe to go to another country which he understands has treated immigrants as immigrants coming to Canada have been treated. The minister says I was very wrong in saying anything about the synchronizing of the formation of this department with the organization of the Unionist Government. I venture to tell him that 'the Unionist Government had very little in mind in regard 'to immigration and colonization at that time. It was not a period when immigrants were entering Canada or when commercial interests were very greatly thought of. That Government was organized for one purpose, and one purpose only; and it is vain for the minister to tell me that after the Department of the Interior had for fifty years been managing all the branches pertaining to this work, that it dawned upon him in the middle of the war that it was necessary to create a new department to handle people that were not coming to Canada. I have my own view's about -the matter, and the minister has his; but when he makes a -statement, and I make another contrary to his, the circumstances of the case strongly confirm my assertion as to the synchronizing which took place at the time of the formation of the Unionist Government.

We have enormous resources in this country; on a conservative estimate, the amount of arable land in this country suitable for settlement is at least one hundred million acres, scattered all over the provinces. Our homestead lands adjacent to railways-I am speaking of federal lands now-have to a very large extent been settled on. But there is an abundance of
other land, valued at from $15 to $20 an acre, and this is a fact that is easily brought to the attention of prospective settlers. Those who have been coming to Canada from the United States during the past few years have not been seeking homesteads to any great extent, but have been purchasing this land fairly freely. It is estimated that in Alberta and Saskatchewan alone there are about 25,000,000 acres of this kind of land which, so long as it does not exceed $25 or $30 an >acre, will be quite an attraction to those who are looking for farms in a new country. The work of the department is to inform intending immigrants of this fact. This is being done in the United States through our agencies, and by advertising, publicity campaigns and various other means, and it is partially as a result of the activities of the department that settlers are coming to Canada. In Eastern Canada, particularly in Ontario and Quebec, and to some extent in New Brunswick, there are still areas of land suitable for settlement, some of which will require a little development. But, nevertheless, conditions are such that the possibilities of making homes in northern Ontario, northern Quebec, and New Brunswick may be made attractive to those desirous to settle in a bush country or a country that is partially wooded. We are now in negotiation with the governments of these provinces, and have in mind the preparation of plans whereby the possibilities of settlement in these three eastern provinces may be brought before those looking for new homes in a country such as northern Ontario and Quebec. I have no doubt at all that if the plans for that work are carefully prepared and the necessary publicity work is carried out, a good many settlers can be induced to go into those regions in Eastern Canada. I think the hon member knows of quite a number of settlers who have gone into northern Quebec. I purpose to have a survey of the situation made this summer in order that we may know exactly the facts, and by consultation with the governments of Quebec and Ontario, and by necessary co-operation, we hope to be able to conduct a publicity campaign in Great Britain and the United States that will aid in the settlement and development of those portions of Eastern Canada to which I have referred. I have already had several interviews with members of the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Governments, and I trust that we shall be able to assist ** development of those provinces in the way of settlement.

I have some knowledge of Western Canada and of land values there. I am afraid that if the minister's agents in the United States are telling people that they can buy land within a reasonable distance of a railway at $15 an acre they are

misleading them because there are very few places where you can buy land at $15, $20 or $25 an acre within any reasonable distance of a railway. Before the minister increases his expenditure upon immigration to any great extent he should try and make some provision whereby the land can be loosened from the grip of the speculators in Western Canada who are holding it for a rise in price, using the Immigration Department and the money of the people of Canada to bring in customers for that land, to the disadvantage not only of Canada but particularly of Western Canada. We have railways running through territory where the land is all held by speculators. We have national railways running through Canadian Pacific land. You cannot buy that land for anything like $15 per acre. Any that is within any reasonable, or farming, distance of a railway is being held at $25, $30, $40 and $45 per acre. The price and the cash payments are so high that it is almost impossible for a man with little means, say $2,500 or $3,000, to get upon that iand, even to get a quarter section, because the holders want a big cash payment and it takes a considerable amount of money to get stock and implements. I noticed in the press this morning that the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment Department have in the neighbourhood of 5,000 applications from soldiers for land and that something like 1,900 have been dealt with. If this land is so plentiful that we can afford to look for immigrants throughout the world, the soldiers should be able to get land more readily. If we have no land why are we spending money to get people to come in here to add to the number of unemployed and to go upon strike? If there is not enough work now for the people who are in the country, why should we be looking for other people to come in here and increase the difficulties that we have upon our hands? I am afraid that Parliament is living in a fool's paradise at the present time. I believe that the strike condition is very much worse than the Government consider it to be. We were told by the ministers that they were not in communication with Winnipeg and that the information they had about the strike came through newspaper reports. If that is the condition, instead of sitting here voting away money for immigration, we should be looking into the fundamental reasons for this unrest and particularly for the reason why we are not able to get people on the land and why they are flocking into the cities. I had expected that the Minister oi Immigration and Colonization, after more

than a year and a half at the head of this department, would have had some very definite ideas about immigration and colonization, I thought 'he would have evolved a plan, that he would have come to the House and told us that he did not think we could satisfactorily handle any more immigration for the present year, and that he had solved the land problem so that people could get on the land instead of being encouraged to flock into the cities working for less than a living wage, with the high cost of living outstripping their salaries and wages. If the minister does not get any more information than he has given us he is not spending this $1,500,000 of the people's money very intelligently.

It is rauher startling to find that this department is costing so much money. I took occasion last year to remind the minister that his department is merely a subdivision, something like the situation in which a farmer finds himself when he divides his hundred acres of land between his two sons; there might be enough for one but not enough for either when he divides his substance between them. For many years we found that this work was being attended to by one department, but when it became necessary to provide for the younger son, the patrimony was divided. This younger son, in the person of the Minister of Immigration, should realize that this department is not necessary at all. At all events, it was not found necessary until an extraordinary condition arose in this country. The minister should handle the affairs of the department with great care so that no person would have any reason to say that his administration was characterized by any degree of extravagance. But as has been pointed out by my hon. friend from Antigonish and Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair), the extraordinary condition exists that as the number of immigrants falls off the cost per capita ascends. That is a condition which should not exist and one for which the minister should give some satisfactory explanation. There is another phase of the new department which should receive attention and that is that the minister should have everything at his finger ends in connection with it. It is only about two years old. He started on the ground floor with everything new. He is the creator, the promoter, the advancer of his department and he has been with it from the beginning. He is not like a man who took charge of a big department after it had been growing for many years and from whom it might be unreasonable to expect a knowledge of all the various details. Here is a department that started into operation with himself at the head of it. He ought to know all about it. There should not be any underground workings in connection with it with which he was not familiar. I am more or less disappointed with the degree of familiarity and knowledge of his department that he displayed in connection with these items. I suppose the minister is a busy man, has a great many things to do and that he possibly did not anticipate the questions that would be asked, but I would expect more details and greater capacity to answer the various proper questions that have been submitted to the minister. The minister tells us that there are other items undeT which we would have wider scope to deal with the lands that we have in the West, but, now that he has entered upon the matter himself, I would say that when he comes down again he ought to tell us in a systematic way, dealing with every province by itself, how much land the Government has to be disposed of for settlement purposes, where these lands are, at what price, under what arrangements are they available for settlement, how far are they from railways in the various provinces and particularly the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. I do not understand that the Government has very much acreage in British Columbia, and possibly not a very large acreage in Ontario-in fact I do not know whether the Government possesses any land in that province. I also wish to state to the minister that I think there has been a very poor system followed in disposing of Government lands in the West. For that the minister is not at all responsible, but it is possibly not yet too late to establish a better system. I think that only certain areas of land should be set off for settlement, and until they have been disposed of and occupied, settlers should not be allowed to run away hundreds of miles from the railway by reason of a whim or fancy of their own, when the lands in those far-off districts are no better than those which are available closer to the railways. By establishing a system of that kind settlers would be located together, within range of a railway station, and we would not be called upon, as we are now, to build

a larger mileage of railways than constitutes a fair proportion per capita for the population which we serve in that country. I would suggest to the minister that he should carefully inquire into the way in which this land is disposed of, and that he will see to it in future that the allotment of the land is carried out on a proper basis having regard to the railway accommodation which row exists in the West. It would be far better in the interests of settlers themselves to follow out some such plan, because they could get their grain and other products more easily shipped. It would likewise be more satisfactory for the communities that are growing up, because they could have schools, religious services, and other facilities more easily provided when they are in settlements or villages. - This is a matter which I wish particularly to bring to the notice of the minister.
The minister has observed that we have large quantities of land in the West. I am glad to hear that such is the case, because my understanding was that the Government had been disappointed when it came to take an inventory of the Government lands that were available in connection with the settlement of soldiers on the land. I am informed-I cannot say whether this is official or not-that the Government discovered when looking for land to give to the soldiers, that it did not have nearly as much as it thought it had, and now finds it necessary to expropriate lands which companies have bought, or have received as railway subsidies, and which are being held possibly for speculative purposes. When the minister comes before the Committee again he may be able to tell us, if such comes within his department, what the policy of the Government is in respect of such lands. I would like him, in fact, to give a general idea of the policy of the Government as to the disposal of lands which it owns and which will be dealt with in connection with immigration purposes. There is, of course, a close alliance between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Immigration and Colonization, and I am not expecting the minister to answer questions regarding matter which more properly come within the purview of the former department.

Harrison, commissioners who were appointed to report on the pilotage districts of Miramichi, Sydney, Louisburg, Halifax, St. John, Montreal and Quebec. The report has been received by the department, laid on .the Table, .and distributed to members. I direct the minister's attention especially to the recommendations regarding the Miramichi district. I was very glad to hear the minister announce that he proposes to introduce a Bill to bring certain of our great national ports under his department to a greater extent than has been the case in the past. The recommendations of the commission regarding the Miramichi district are as follows:
That the condition of the pilotage in this district has been found to he exceptional and the earnings of the .pilots during the year 1917 have been exceedingly low, owing .to the falling off of deal shipments by water, from the ports in this distriot. That it is most urgent that something should be done whereby tihe individual earnings of these .pilots may be increased, and with this in view we strongly recommend that the number of' pilots be reduced so as not to exceed twelve, and to accomplish this aim will require the retirement of four of the oldest pilots, whose ages range from 71 to 74. The enforced retirement of these men your commissioners consider will entail a certain hardship as they are well preserved and still active. Having these conditions in mind we recommend that some compensation be made to these men annually, to a sum not exceeding $300, for the remainder of their lives; but this shall be understood not to extend to any pilots who may hereafter be retired in this district. This will be in lino with the precedent created by the Marine Department in the Quebec Pilotage district when reducing the number of pilots in that district a few years ago.

The next paragraph refers to the Admiral Beatty, the vessel that is used in connection with this work, and sets out the fact that recently one of the vessels was lost at sea, and hence is no longer available for the work. The concluding paragraph is as follows:
That an additional five per centum per annum be deducted from the gross earnings of the pilots of this district for the purpose of creating and maintaining a superannuation fund for the pilots retiring in the district.
The average income of the pilots, for six months or during open navigation is about $750 per man, but owing to war conditions in 1917 the net earnings of each pilot were reduced to the nominal sum of $150. It is no wonder the commissioners say that something should be done in this matter. The conditions are very exceptional, and I am glad that the minister is considering the case of Miramichi, which is one of the greatest waterways in Canada. I am sure that a large number of ocean vessels will load there this year, and from this year's operations I have no doubt the men will receive a fair remuneration. But the whole situation is very unsatisfactory. The evidence shows that only three or four of the pilots are below the age of 66. The majority are between 60 and 70, and three or four of them are over 70. It seems to me that it would be reasonable to retire men of that age and not allow them to be in charge of valuable property. The loss of one vessel would more than counterbalance any reasonable provision that might be made for these men, and I hope that when the minister is reconsidering the matter he will give his earnest and considerate attention to the claims of the pilots on the Miramichi river. I do not think he would go very far afield if he accepted the suggestion of the Commission, and granted a small amount, not to exceed $300, as compensation to these three men between the .ages of 71 and 74. I trust he will see his way clear to vote a certain sum as the nucleus of a pension fund to which the pilots could pay so much annually out of their earnings, so that in the future when a pilot reaches a certain age he can be superannuated.
